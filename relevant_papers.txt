**Abstract:**
Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOCs) are widely used to investigate
information scrambling in quantum systems. However, directly computing OTOCs
with classical computers is an expensive procedure. This is due to the need to
classically simulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, which entails
computational costs that scale rapidly with system size. Similarly, exact
simulation of the dynamics with a quantum computer (QC) will either only be
possible for short times with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices,
or will require a fault-tolerant QC which is currently beyond technological
capabilities. This motivates a search for alternative approaches to determine
OTOCs and related quantities. In this study, we explore four parameterised sets
of Hamiltonians describing local one-dimensional quantum systems of interest in
condensed matter physics. For each set, we investigate whether classical kernel
methods (KMs) can accurately learn the XZ-OTOC and a particular sum of OTOCs,
as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters. We frame the problem as a
regression task, generating small batches of labelled data with classical
tensor network methods for quantum many-body systems with up to 40 qubits.
Using this data, we train a variety of standard kernel machines and observe
that the Laplacian and radial basis function (RBF) kernels perform best,
achieving a coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) on the testing sets of at
least 0.7167, with averages between 0.8112 and 0.9822 for the various sets of
Hamiltonians, together with small root mean squared error and mean absolute
error. Hence, after training, the models can replace further uses of tensor
networks for calculating an OTOC function of a system within the parameterised
sets. Accordingly, the proposed method can assist with extensive evaluations of
an OTOC function.

**Abstract:**
We investigate the potential of near-term quantum algorithms for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on a linear one-dimensional
advection-diffusion equation as a test case. This study benchmarks a
ground-state algorithm, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), against three
leading quantum dynamics algorithms, Trotterization, Variational Quantum
Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQTE), and Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics
Simulation (AVQDS), applied to the same PDE on small quantum hardware. While
Trotterization is fully quantum, VarQTE and AVQDS are variational algorithms
that reduce circuit depth for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.
However, hardware results from these dynamics methods show sizable errors due
to noise and limited shot statistics. To establish a noise-free performance
baseline, we implement the VQE-based solver on a noiseless statevector
simulator. Our results show VQE can reach final-time infidelities as low as
${O}(10^{-9})$ with $N=4$ qubits and moderate circuit depths, outperforming
hardware-deployed dynamics methods that show infidelities $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$. By
comparing noiseless VQE to shot-based and hardware-run algorithms, we assess
their accuracy and resource demands, providing a baseline for future quantum
PDE solvers. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and potential
extensions to higher-dimensional, nonlinear PDEs relevant to engineering and
finance.

## Undecidable problems associated with variational quantum algorithms

**Abstract:**
Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA),
are widely studied as candidates for near-term quantum advantage. Recent work
has shown that training VQAs is NP-hard in general. In this paper, we present a
conditional result suggesting that the training of VQAs is undecidable, even in
idealized, noiseless settings. We reduce the decision version of the digitized
VQA training problem-where circuit parameters are drawn from a discrete set-to
the question of whether a universal Diophantine equation (UDE) has a root. This
reduction relies on encoding the UDE into the structure of a variational
quantum circuit via the matrix exponentials. The central step involves
establishing a correspondence between the objective function of the VQA and a
known UDE of 58 variables and degree 4. Our main result is conditional on a
natural conjecture: that a certain system of structured complex polynomial
equations-arising from the inner product of a VQA circuit output and a fixed
observable-has at least one solution. We argue this conjecture is plausible
based on dimension-counting arguments (degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonians,
state vector, and observable), and the generic solvability of such systems in
algebraic geometry over the complex numbers. Under this assumption, we suggest
that deciding whether a digitized VQA achieves a given energy threshold is
undecidable. This links the limitations of variational quantum algorithms to
foundational questions in mathematics and logic, extending the known landscape
of quantum computational hardness to include uncomputability. Additionally, we
establish an unconditional undecidability result for VQA convergence in open
quantum systems.

## Choco-Q: Commute Hamiltonian-based QAOA for Constrained Binary Optimization

**Abstract:**
Constrained binary optimization aims to find an optimal assignment to
minimize or maximize the objective meanwhile satisfying the constraints, which
is a representative NP problem in various domains, including transportation,
scheduling, and economy. Quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA)
provide a promising methodology for solving this problem by exploiting the
parallelism of quantum entanglement. However, existing QAOA approaches based on
penalty-term or Hamiltonian simulation fail to thoroughly encode the
constraints, leading to extremely low success rate and long searching latency.
  This paper proposes Choco-Q, a formal and universal framework for constrained
binary optimization problems, which comprehensively covers all constraints and
exhibits high deployability for current quantum devices. The main innovation of
Choco-Q is to embed the commute Hamiltonian as the driver Hamiltonian,
resulting in a much more general encoding formulation that can deal with
arbitrary linear constraints. Leveraging the arithmetic features of commute
Hamiltonian, we propose three optimization techniques to squeeze the overall
circuit complexity, including Hamiltonian serialization, equivalent
decomposition, and variable elimination. The serialization mechanism transforms
the original Hamiltonian into smaller ones. Our decomposition methods only take
linear time complexity, achieving end-to-end acceleration. Experiments
demonstrate that Choco-Q shows more than 235$\times$ algorithmic improvement in
successfully finding the optimal solution, and achieves 4.69$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration, compared to prior QAOA designs.

**Abstract:**
Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted
segment of a larger quantum many-body state, while generating entanglement for
its remaining constituents. We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced
phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states.
In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to
symmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we
investigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the
decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the
toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected
topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the
boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The
corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the
2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at
$\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher
network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of
self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or
(non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from
this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel
type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising
model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach
combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we
chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and
entanglement entropy measures. Our results point to a way towards a general
understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of
symmetry and topology.

## SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization

**Authors:** Hao Wang, Ligong Han, Kai Xu, Akash Srivastava

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24358v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from
previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of
increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress
KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can
accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired
outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache
quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to
capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor
quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and
original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of
quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no
model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and
is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical
experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82,
improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark
scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.

## The impact of internal variability on benchmarking deep learning climate emulators

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05288v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Full-complexity Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally very
expensive, limiting their use in exploring the climate outcomes of multiple
emission pathways. More efficient emulators that approximate ESMs can directly
map emissions onto climate outcomes, and benchmarks are being used to evaluate
their accuracy on standardized tasks and datasets. We investigate a popular
benchmark in data-driven climate emulation, ClimateBench, on which deep
learning-based emulators are currently achieving the best performance. We
compare these deep learning emulators with a linear regression-based emulator,
akin to pattern scaling, and show that it outperforms the incumbent
100M-parameter deep learning foundation model, ClimaX, on 3 out of 4
regionally-resolved climate variables, notably surface temperature and
precipitation. While emulating surface temperature is expected to be
predominantly linear, this result is surprising for emulating precipitation.
Precipitation is a much more noisy variable, and we show that deep learning
emulators can overfit to internal variability noise at low frequencies,
degrading their performance in comparison to a linear emulator. We address the
issue of overfitting by increasing the number of climate simulations per
emission pathway (from 3 to 50) and updating the benchmark targets with the
respective ensemble averages from the MPI-ESM1.2-LR model. Using the new
targets, we show that linear pattern scaling continues to be more accurate on
temperature, but can be outperformed by a deep learning-based technique for
emulating precipitation. We publish our code and data at
github.com/blutjens/climate-emulator.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24130v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This work proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) modeling approach to predict
the resulting surface from a particle based fabrication process. The latter
consists of spray-based printing of cementitious plaster on a wall and is
facilitated with the use of a robotic arm. The predictions are computed using
the robotic arm trajectory features, such as position, velocity and direction,
as well as the printing process parameters. The proposed approach, based on a
particle representation of the wall domain and the end effector, allows for the
adoption of a graph-based solution. The GNN model consists of an
encoder-processor-decoder architecture and is trained using data from
laboratory tests, while the hyperparameters are optimized by means of a
Bayesian scheme. The aim of this model is to act as a simulator of the printing
process, and ultimately used for the generation of the robotic arm trajectory
and the optimization of the printing parameters, towards the materialization of
an autonomous plastering process. The performance of the proposed model is
assessed in terms of the prediction error against unseen ground truth data,
which shows its generality in varied scenarios, as well as in comparison with
the performance of an existing benchmark model. The results demonstrate a
significant improvement over the benchmark model, with notably better
performance and enhanced error scaling across prediction steps.

## Data-Driven Forecasting of High-Dimensional Transient and Stationary Processes via Space-Time Projection

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23686v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Space-Time Projection (STP) is introduced as a data-driven forecasting
approach for high-dimensional and time-resolved data. The method computes
extended space-time proper orthogonal modes from training data spanning a
prediction horizon comprising both hindcast and forecast intervals. Forecasts
are then generated by projecting the hindcast portion of these modes onto new
data, simultaneously leveraging their orthogonality and optimal correlation
with the forecast extension. Rooted in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
theory, dimensionality reduction and time-delay embedding are intrinsic to the
approach. For a given ensemble and fixed prediction horizon, the only tunable
parameter is the truncation rank--no additional hyperparameters are required.
The hindcast accuracy serves as a reliable indicator for short-term forecast
accuracy and establishes a lower bound on forecast errors. The efficacy of the
method is demonstrated using two datasets: transient, highly anisotropic
simulations of supernova explosions in a turbulent interstellar medium, and
experimental velocity fields of a turbulent high-subsonic engineering flow. In
a comparative study with standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
networks--acknowledging that alternative architectures or training strategies
may yield different outcomes--the method consistently provided more accurate
forecasts. Considering its simplicity and robust performance, STP offers an
interpretable and competitive benchmark for forecasting high-dimensional
transient and chaotic processes, relying purely on spatiotemporal correlation
information.

## Hypothesis testing of symmetry in quantum dynamics

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14292v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Symmetry plays a crucial role in quantum physics, dictating the behavior and
dynamics of physical systems. In this paper, we develop a hypothesis-testing
framework for quantum dynamics symmetry using a limited number of queries to
the unknown unitary operation and establish the quantum max-relative entropy
lower bound for the type-II error. We construct optimal ancilla-free protocols
that achieve optimal type-II error probability for testing time-reversal
symmetry (T-symmetry) and diagonal symmetry (Z-symmetry) with limited queries.
Contrasting with the advantages of indefinite causal order strategies in
various quantum information processing tasks, we show that parallel, adaptive,
and indefinite causal order strategies have equal power for our tasks. We
establish optimal protocols for T-symmetry testing and Z-symmetry testing for 6
and 5 queries, respectively, from which we infer that the type-II error
exhibits a decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(m^{-2})$ with respect to the number of
queries $m$. This represents a significant improvement over the basic
repetition protocols without using global entanglement, where the error decays
at a slower rate of $\mathcal{O}(m^{-1})$.

## Information Theoretic One-Time Programs from Geometrically Local $\text{QNC}_0$ Adversaries

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22016v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We show how to construct simulation secure one-time memories, and thus
one-time programs, without computational assumptions in the presence of
constraints on quantum hardware. Specifically, we build one-time memories from
random linear codes and quantum random access codes (QRACs) when constrained to
non-adaptive, constant depth, and $D$-dimensional geometrically-local quantum
circuit for some constant $D$. We place no restrictions on the adversary's
classical computational power, number of qubits it can use, or the coherence
time of its qubits. Notably, our construction can still be secure even in the
presence of fault tolerant quantum computation as long as the input qubits are
encoded in a non-fault tolerant manner (e.g. encoded as high energy states in
non-ideal hardware). Unfortunately though, our construction requires decoding
random linear codes and thus does not run in polynomial time. We leave open the
question of whether one can construct a polynomial time information
theoretically secure one-time memory from geometrically local quantum circuits.
  Of potentially independent interest, we develop a progress bound for
information leakage via collision entropy (Renyi entropy of order $2$) along
with a few key technical lemmas for a "mutual information" for collision
entropies. We also develop new bounds on how much information a specific $2
\mapsto 1$ QRAC can leak about its input, which may be of independent interest
as well.

## ADMM for Structured Fractional Minimization

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07496v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This paper considers a class of structured fractional minimization problems.
The numerator consists of a differentiable function, a simple nonconvex
nonsmooth function, a concave nonsmooth function, and a convex nonsmooth
function composed with a linear operator. The denominator is a continuous
function that is either weakly convex or has a weakly convex square root. These
problems are prevalent in various important applications in machine learning
and data science. Existing methods, primarily based on subgradient methods and
smoothing proximal gradient methods, often suffer from slow convergence and
numerical stability issues. In this paper, we introduce {\sf FADMM}, the first
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers tailored for this class of
problems. {\sf FADMM} decouples the original problem into linearized proximal
subproblems, featuring two variants: one using Dinkelbach's parametric method
({\sf FADMM-D}) and the other using the quadratic transform method ({\sf
FADMM-Q}). By introducing a novel Lyapunov function, we establish that {\sf
FADMM} converges to $\epsilon$-approximate critical points of the problem
within an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{3})$. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including sparse Fisher
discriminant analysis, robust Sharpe ratio minimization, and robust sparse
recovery, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

**Abstract:**
Accurately modeling the electronic structure of water across scales, from
individual molecules to bulk liquid, remains a grand challenge. Traditional
computational methods face a critical trade-off between computational cost and
efficiency.We present an enhanced machine-learning Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS)
method for improved electronic structure, DeePKS-ES, that overcomes this
dilemma. By incorporating the Hamiltonian matrix and their eigenvalues and
eigenvectors into the loss function, we establish a universal model for water
systems, which can reproduce high-level hybrid functional (HSE06) electronic
properties from inexpensive generalized gradient approximation (PBE)
calculations. Validated across molecular clusters and liquid-phase simulations,
our approach reliably predicts key electronic structure properties such as band
gaps and density of states, as well as total energy and atomic forces. This
work bridges quantum-mechanical precision with scalable computation, offering
transformative opportunities for modeling aqueous systems in catalysis, climate
science, and energy storage.

**Abstract:**
We introduce a data-driven approach to learn a generalized kinetic collision
operator directly from molecular dynamics. Unlike the conventional (e.g.,
Landau) models, the present operator takes an anisotropic form that accounts
for a second energy transfer arising from the collective interactions between
the pair of collision particles and the environment. Numerical results show
that preserving the broadly overlooked anisotropic nature of the collision
energy transfer is crucial for predicting the plasma kinetics with
non-negligible correlations, where the Landau model shows limitations.

## Learning Beamforming Codebooks for Active Sensing with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface

**Authors:** Zhongze Zhang, Wei Yu
**Categories:** eess.SP, cs.IT, cs.LG, math.IT
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19046v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This paper explores the design of beamforming codebooks for the base station
(BS) and for the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in an active
sensing scheme for uplink localization, in which the mobile user transmits a
sequence of pilots to the BS through reflection at the RISs, and the BS and the
RISs are adaptively configured by carefully choosing BS beamforming codeword
and RIS codewords from their respective codebooks in a sequential manner to
progressively focus onto the user. Most existing codebook designs for RIS are
not tailored for active sensing, by which we mean the choice of the next
codeword should depend on the measurements made so far, and the sequence of
codewords should dynamically focus reflection toward the user. Moreover, most
existing codeword selection methods rely on exhaustive search in beam training
to identify the codeword with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus
incurring substantial pilot overhead as the size of the codebook scales. This
paper proposes a learning-based approach for codebook construction and for
codeword selection for active sensing. The proposed learning approach aims to
locate a target in the service area by recursively selecting a sequence of BS
beamforming codewords and RIS codewords from the respective codebooks as more
measurements become available without exhaustive beam training. The codebook
design and the codeword selection fuse key ideas from the vector quantized
variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network
to learn respectively the discrete function space of the codebook and the
temporal dependencies between measurements.

## Automatic Identification of Traps in Molecular Charge Transport Networks of Organic Semiconductors

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07136v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a method to identify traps in molecular charge
transport networks as obtained by multiscale modeling of organic
semiconductors. Depending on the materials, traps can be defect-like single
molecules or clusters of several neighboring ones, and can have a significant
impact on the dynamics of charge carriers. Our proposed method builds on the
random walk model of charge dynamics on a directed, weighted graph, the
molecular transport network. It comprises an effective heuristic to determine
the number of traps or trap clusters based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
of the random walk Laplacian matrix and uses subsequent spectral clustering
techniques to identify these traps. In contrast to currently available methods,
ours enables identification of trap molecules in organic semiconductors without
having to explicitly simulate the charge dynamics and is applicable to a
variety of energy- or topology-based traps in homomolecular or mixed systems
with or without detailed-balance. As a prototypical system we simulate an
amorphous morphology of bathocuproine, a material with known high energetic
disorder and charge trapping. Based on a first-principle multiscale model, we
first obtain a reference charge transport network and then purposefully modify
its properties to represent different trap characteristics. In contrast to
currently available methods, our approach successfully identifies both single
trap, multiple distributed traps, and a combination of a single-molecule trap
and trap regions on an equal footing.

## Learning out-of-time-ordered correlators with classical kernel methods

**Authors:** John Tanner, Jason Pye, Jingbo Wang

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01592v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOCs) are widely used to investigate
information scrambling in quantum systems. However, directly computing OTOCs
with classical computers is an expensive procedure. This is due to the need to
classically simulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, which entails
computational costs that scale rapidly with system size. Similarly, exact
simulation of the dynamics with a quantum computer (QC) will either only be
possible for short times with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices,
or will require a fault-tolerant QC which is currently beyond technological
capabilities. This motivates a search for alternative approaches to determine
OTOCs and related quantities. In this study, we explore four parameterised sets
of Hamiltonians describing local one-dimensional quantum systems of interest in
condensed matter physics. For each set, we investigate whether classical kernel
methods (KMs) can accurately learn the XZ-OTOC and a particular sum of OTOCs,
as functions of the Hamiltonian parameters. We frame the problem as a
regression task, generating small batches of labelled data with classical
tensor network methods for quantum many-body systems with up to 40 qubits.
Using this data, we train a variety of standard kernel machines and observe
that the Laplacian and radial basis function (RBF) kernels perform best,
achieving a coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) on the testing sets of at
least 0.7167, with averages between 0.8112 and 0.9822 for the various sets of
Hamiltonians, together with small root mean squared error and mean absolute
error. Hence, after training, the models can replace further uses of tensor
networks for calculating an OTOC function of a system within the parameterised
sets. Accordingly, the proposed method can assist with extensive evaluations of
an OTOC function.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24321v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We consider the task of privately obtaining prediction error guarantees in
ordinary least-squares regression problems with Gaussian covariates (with
unknown covariance structure). We provide the first sample-optimal polynomial
time algorithm for this task under both pure and approximate differential
privacy. We show that any improvement to the sample complexity of our algorithm
would violate either statistical-query or information-theoretic lower bounds.
Additionally, our algorithm is robust to a small fraction of arbitrary outliers
and achieves optimal error rates as a function of the fraction of outliers. In
contrast, all prior efficient algorithms either incurred sample complexities
with sub-optimal dimension dependence, scaling with the condition number of the
covariates, or obtained a polynomially worse dependence on the privacy
parameters.
  Our technical contributions are two-fold: first, we leverage resilience
guarantees of Gaussians within the sum-of-squares framework. As a consequence,
we obtain efficient sum-of-squares algorithms for regression with optimal
robustness rates and sample complexity. Second, we generalize the recent
robustness-to-privacy framework [HKMN23, (arXiv:2212.05015)] to account for the
geometry induced by the covariance of the input samples. This framework
crucially relies on the robust estimators to be sum-of-squares algorithms, and
combining the two steps yields a sample-optimal private regression algorithm.
We believe our techniques are of independent interest, and we demonstrate this
by obtaining an efficient algorithm for covariance-aware mean estimation, with
an optimal dependence on the privacy parameters.

## Value of Information-based Deceptive Path Planning Under Adversarial Interventions

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24284v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Existing methods for deceptive path planning (DPP) address the problem of
designing paths that conceal their true goal from a passive, external observer.
Such methods do not apply to problems where the observer has the ability to
perform adversarial interventions to impede the path planning agent. In this
paper, we propose a novel Markov decision process (MDP)-based model for the DPP
problem under adversarial interventions and develop new value of information
(VoI) objectives to guide the design of DPP policies. Using the VoI objectives
we propose, path planning agents deceive the adversarial observer into choosing
suboptimal interventions by selecting trajectories that are of low
informational value to the observer. Leveraging connections to the linear
programming theory for MDPs, we derive computationally efficient solution
methods for synthesizing policies for performing DPP under adversarial
interventions. In our experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed solution method in achieving deceptiveness under adversarial
interventions and demonstrate the superior performance of our approach to both
existing DPP methods and conservative path planning approaches on illustrative
gridworld problems.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Quantum computing has been a prominent research area for decades, inspiring
transformative fields such as quantum simulation, quantum teleportation, and
quantum machine learning (QML), which are undergoing rapid development. Within
QML, hybrid classical-quantum algorithms like Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)
and Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQCs) have shown promise in leveraging
quantum circuits and classical optimizers to classify classical data
efficiently.Simultaneously, classical machine learning has made significant
strides in graph classification, employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
analyze systems ranging from large-scale structures like the Large Hadron
Collider to molecular and biological systems like proteins and DNA. Combining
the advancements in quantum computing and graph classification presents a
unique opportunity to develop quantum algorithms capable of extracting features
from graphs and performing their classification effectively. In this paper, we
propose a novel quantum encoding framework for graph classification using VQCs.
Unlike existing approaches such as PCA-VQC, which rely on dimensionality
reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and may lead to
information loss, our method preserves the integrity of graph data.
Furthermore, our encoding approach is optimized for Noise-Intermediate Scale
Quantum (NISQ) devices, requiring a limited number of qubits while achieving
comparable or superior classification performance to PCA-VQC. By constructing
slightly more complex circuits tailored for graph encoding, we demonstrate that
VQCs can effectively classify graphs within the constraints of current quantum
hardware.

## Q-fid: Quantum Circuit Fidelity Improvement with LSTM Networks

**Authors:** Yikai Mao, Shaswot Shresthamali, Masaaki Kondo
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.AI, cs.ET, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17523v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The fidelity of quantum circuits (QC) is influenced by several factors,
including hardware characteristics, calibration status, and the transpilation
process, all of which impact their susceptibility to noise. However, existing
methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different
circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a
standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q-fid is introduced, a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a
novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q-fid
provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity
prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized
circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their
impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically
adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity
predictions under varying conditions. Q-fid achieves a high prediction accuracy
with an average RMSE of 0.0515, up to 24.7x more accurate than the Qiskit
transpile tool mapomatic. By offering a reliable method for fidelity
prediction, Q-fid empowers developers to optimize transpilation strategies,
leading to more efficient and noise-resilient quantum circuit implementations.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24072v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Urbanization is the key contributor for climate change. Increasing
urbanization rate causes an urban heat island (UHI) effect, which strongly
depends on the short- and long-wave radiation balance heat flux between the
surfaces. In order to calculate accurately this heat flux, it is required to
assess the surface temperature which depends on the knowledge of the thermal
properties and the surface heat transfer coefficients in the heat transfer
problem. The aim of this paper is to estimate the thermal properties of the
ground and the time varying surface heat transfer coefficient by solving an
inverse problem. The Dufort--Frankel scheme is applied for solving the unsteady
heat transfer problem. For the inverse problem, a Markov chain Monte Carlo
method is used to estimate the posterior probability density function of
unknown parameters within the Bayesian framework of statistics, by applying the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for random sample generation. Actual temperature
measurements available at different ground depths were used for the solution of
the inverse problem. Different time discretizations were examined for the
transient heat transfer coefficient at the ground surface, which then involved
different prior distributions. Results of different case studies show that the
estimated values of the unknown parameters were in accordance with literature
values. Moreover, with the present solution of the inverse problem the
temperature residuals were smaller than those obtained by using literature
values for the unknowns.

## Causal Emergence 2.0: Quantifying emergent complexity

**Authors:** Erik Hoel
**Categories:** cs.IT, math.IT
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13395v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Complex systems can be described at myriad different scales, and their causal
workings often have multiscale structure (e.g., a computer can be described at
the microscale of its hardware circuitry, the mesoscale of its machine code,
and the macroscale of its operating system). While scientists study and model
systems across the full hierarchy of their scales, from microphysics to
macroeconomics, there is debate about what the macroscales of systems can
possibly add beyond mere compression. To resolve this longstanding issue, here
a new theory of emergence is introduced wherein the different scales of a
system are treated like slices of a higher-dimensional object. The theory can
distinguish which of these scales possess unique causal contributions, and
which are not causally relevant. Constructed from an axiomatic notion of
causation, the theory's application is demonstrated in coarse-grains of Markov
chains. It identifies all cases of macroscale causation: instances where
reduction to a microscale is possible, yet lossy about causation. Furthermore,
the theory posits a causal apportioning schema that calculates the causal
contribution of each scale, showing what each uniquely adds. Finally, it
reveals a novel measure of emergent complexity: how widely distributed a
system's causal workings are across its hierarchy of scales.

## A Comparison among Single Carrier, OFDM, and OTFS in mmWave Multi-Connectivity Downlink Transmissions

**Authors:** Fabian Göttsch, Shuangyang Li, Lorenzo Miretti, Giuseppe Caire, Sławomir Stańczak
**Categories:** cs.IT, math.IT
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23745v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this paper, we perform a comparative study of common wireless
communication waveforms, namely the single carrier (SC), orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), and orthogonal time-frequency-space
(OTFS) modulation in a millimeter wave (mmWave) downlink multi-connectivity
scenario, where multiple access points (APs) jointly serve a given user under
imperfect time and frequency synchronization errors. For a fair comparison, all
the three waveforms are evaluated using variants of common frequency domain
equalization (FDE). To this end, a novel cross domain iterative detection for
OTFS is proposed. The performance of the different waveforms is evaluated
numerically in terms of pragmatic capacity. The numerical results show that
OTFS significantly outperforms SC and OFDM at cost of reasonably increased
complexity, because of the low cyclic-prefix (CP) overhead and the
effectiveness of the proposed detection.

## Intersection of linear and multi-twisted codes with applications

**Authors:** Ramy Takieldin
**Categories:** cs.IT, math.IT
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24303v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this paper, we derive a formula for constructing a generator matrix for
the intersection of any pair of linear codes over a finite field. Consequently,
we establish a condition under which a linear code has a trivial intersection
with another linear code (or its Galois dual). Furthermore, we provide a
condition for reversibility and propose a generator matrix formula for the
largest reversible subcode of any linear code. We then focus on the
comprehensive class of multi-twisted (MT) codes, which are naturally and more
effectively represented using generator polynomial matrices (GPMs). We prove
that the reversed code of an MT code remains MT and derive an explicit formula
for its GPM. Additionally, we examine the intersection of a pair of MT codes,
possibly with different shift constants, and demonstrate that this intersection
is not necessarily MT. However, when the intersection has an MT structure, we
determine the corresponding shift constants. We also establish a GPM formula
for the intersection of a pair of MT codes with the same shift constants. This
result enables us to derive a GPM formula for the intersection of an MT code
and the Galois dual of another MT code. Finally, we examine conditions for
various properties on MT codes. Perhaps most importantly, the necessary and
sufficient conditions for an MT code to be Galois self-orthogonal, Galois
dual-containing, Galois linear complementary dual (LCD), or reversible.

## Evaluating Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Dynamics Algorithms on the Advection-Diffusion Equation

**Authors:** A. Barış Özgüler
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CE, cs.ET
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24045v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We investigate the potential of near-term quantum algorithms for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on a linear one-dimensional
advection-diffusion equation as a test case. This study benchmarks a
ground-state algorithm, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), against three
leading quantum dynamics algorithms, Trotterization, Variational Quantum
Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQTE), and Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics
Simulation (AVQDS), applied to the same PDE on small quantum hardware. While
Trotterization is fully quantum, VarQTE and AVQDS are variational algorithms
that reduce circuit depth for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.
However, hardware results from these dynamics methods show sizable errors due
to noise and limited shot statistics. To establish a noise-free performance
baseline, we implement the VQE-based solver on a noiseless statevector
simulator. Our results show VQE can reach final-time infidelities as low as
${O}(10^{-9})$ with $N=4$ qubits and moderate circuit depths, outperforming
hardware-deployed dynamics methods that show infidelities $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$. By
comparing noiseless VQE to shot-based and hardware-run algorithms, we assess
their accuracy and resource demands, providing a baseline for future quantum
PDE solvers. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and potential
extensions to higher-dimensional, nonlinear PDEs relevant to engineering and
finance.

## Residual-based Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration for sparse Hermitian eigenvalue problems tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products

**Authors:** Nikhil Kodali, Kartick Ramakrishnan, Phani Motamarri
**Categories:** physics.comp-ph, cs.NA, math.NA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22652v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Chebyshev Filtered Subspace Iteration (ChFSI) has been widely adopted for
computing a small subset of extreme eigenvalues in large sparse matrices. This
work introduces a residual-based reformulation of ChFSI, referred to as
R-ChFSI, designed to accommodate inexact matrix-vector products while
maintaining robust convergence properties. By reformulating the traditional
Chebyshev recurrence to operate on residuals rather than eigenvector estimates,
the R-ChFSI approach effectively suppresses the errors made in matrix-vector
products, improving the convergence behaviour for both standard and generalized
eigenproblems. This ability of R-ChFSI to be tolerant to inexact matrix-vector
products allows one to incorporate approximate inverses for large-scale
generalized eigenproblems, making the method particularly attractive where
exact matrix factorizations or iterative methods become computationally
expensive for evaluating inverses. It also allows us to compute the
matrix-vector products in lower-precision arithmetic allowing us to leverage
modern hardware accelerators. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate
that R-ChFSI achieves desired residual tolerances while leveraging
low-precision arithmetic. For problems with millions of degrees of freedom and
thousands of eigenvalues, R-ChFSI attains final residual norms in the range of
10$^{-12}$ to 10$^{-14}$, even with FP32 and TF32 arithmetic, significantly
outperforming standard ChFSI in similar settings. In generalized eigenproblems,
where approximate inverses are used, R-ChFSI achieves residual tolerances up to
ten orders of magnitude lower, demonstrating its robustness to approximation
errors. Finally, R-ChFSI provides a scalable and computationally efficient
alternative for solving large-scale eigenproblems in high-performance computing
environments.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06572v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of
the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically
expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with
physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in
limited-data regimes. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of
scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data.
However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with
significant challenges. This review examines PINNs for the first time in terms
of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new
algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed,
precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest
are the gradient-free methods of neuroevolution for optimizing the uniquely
complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient
descent and neuroevolution for discovering bespoke neural architectures and
balancing multiple conflicting terms in physics-informed learning objectives
are positioned as important avenues for future research. Yet another exciting
track is to cast neuroevolution as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models.

## Learning dynamical systems with hit-and-run random feature maps

**Authors:** Pinak Mandal, Georg A. Gottwald
**Categories:** cs.LG, physics.data-an, stat.ME, stat.ML
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06661v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We show how random feature maps can be used to forecast dynamical systems
with excellent forecasting skill. We consider the tanh activation function and
judiciously choose the internal weights in a data-driven manner such that the
resulting features explore the nonlinear, non-saturated regions of the
activation function. We introduce skip connections and construct a deep variant
of random feature maps by combining several units. To mitigate the curse of
dimensionality, we introduce localization where we learn local maps, employing
conditional independence. Our modified random feature maps provide excellent
forecasting skill for both single trajectory forecasts as well as long-time
estimates of statistical properties, for a range of chaotic dynamical systems
with dimensions up to 512. In contrast to other methods such as reservoir
computers which require extensive hyperparameter tuning, we effectively need to
tune only a single hyperparameter, and are able to achieve state-of-the-art
forecast skill with much smaller networks.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11821v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We show that modeling a Grassmannian as symmetric orthogonal matrices
$\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n) \cong\{Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} :
Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} Q = I, \; Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} =
Q,\; \operatorname{tr}(Q)=2k - n\}$ yields exceedingly simple matrix formulas
for various curvatures and curvature-related quantities, both intrinsic and
extrinsic. These include Riemann, Ricci, Jacobi, sectional, scalar, mean,
principal, and Gaussian curvatures; Schouten, Weyl, Cotton, Bach, Pleba\'nski,
cocurvature, nonmetricity, and torsion tensors; first, second, and third
fundamental forms; Gauss and Weingarten maps; and upper and lower delta
invariants. We will derive explicit, simple expressions for the aforementioned
quantities in terms of standard matrix operations that are stably computable
with numerical linear algebra. Many of these aforementioned quantities have
never before been presented for the Grassmannian.

## A Framework for Approximating Perturbed Optimal Control Problems

**Authors:** Riley Link, Ethan Ebbighausen
**Categories:** math.OC, cs.NA, math.NA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09546v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We consider trajectory optimal control problems in which parameter
uncertainty limits the applicability of control trajectories computed prior to
travel. Hence, efficient trajectory adjustment is needed to ensure successful
travel. However, it is often prohibitive or impossible to recalculate the
optimal control in-transit due to strict time constraints or limited onboard
computing resources. Thus, we propose a framework for quick and accurate
trajectory approximations by using post-optimality sensitivity information.
This allows the reduction of uncertain parameter space and an instantaneous
approximation of the new optimal controller while using sensitivity data
computed and stored pretransit.

## Channel Orthogonalization in Panel-Based LIS

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01919v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Large intelligent surface (LIS) has gained momentum as a potential
6G-enabling technology that expands the benefits of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO). On the other hand, orthogonal space-division
multiplexing (OSDM) may give a promising direction for efficient exploitation
of the spatial resources, analogous as what is achieved with orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the frequency domain. To this end, we
study how to enforce channel orthogonality in a panel-based LIS (P-LIS)
scenario. Our proposed method consists of having a subset of active LIS-panels
coherently serving a set of users, and another subset of LIS-panels operating
in a novel low-power mode by implementing a receive and re-transmit (RRTx)
process. This results in an inter-symbol interference (ISI) channel, where we
characterize the RRTx processing required to achieve simultaneous orthogonality
in time and space. We then employ the remaining degrees of freedom (DoFs) from
the orthogonality constraint to minimize the RRTx processing power, where we
derive a closed-form global minimizer, allowing for efficient implementation of
the proposed scheme.

## Multi-User MISO with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces: A DRL-Based Sum-Rate Optimization Approach

**Authors:** Hao Liu, Jiancheng An, George C. Alexandropoulos, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Chau Yuen, Lu Gan

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04837v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) represent a novel signal processing
paradigm that enables over-the-air processing of electromagnetic waves at the
speed of light. Their multi-layer architecture exhibits customizable
computational capabilities compared to conventional single-layer reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces and metasurface lenses. In this paper, we deploy SIM to
improve the performance of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO)
wireless systems through a low complexity manner with reduced numbers of
transmit radio frequency chains. In particular, an optimization formulation for
the joint design of the SIM phase shifts and the transmit power allocation is
presented, which is efficiently tackled via a customized deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) approach that systematically explores pre-designed states of the
SIM-parametrized smart wireless environment. The presented performance
evaluation results demonstrate the proposed method's capability to effectively
learn from the wireless environment, while consistently outperforming
conventional precoding schemes under low transmit power conditions.
Furthermore, the implementation of hyperparameter tuning and whitening process
significantly enhance the robustness of the proposed DRL framework.

## Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13268v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology
that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate
large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation
for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned
and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep
learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator
incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts
(MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and
exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs
the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna
manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers
of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the
proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods
and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers
higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer
natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity
for superior scalability.

## ADMM Algorithms for Residual Network Training: Convergence Analysis and Parallel Implementation

**Authors:** Jintao Xu, Yifei Li, Wenxun Xing
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15334v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We propose both serial and parallel proximal (linearized) alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithms for training residual neural
networks. In contrast to backpropagation-based approaches, our methods
inherently mitigate the exploding gradient issue and are well-suited for
parallel and distributed training through regional updates. Theoretically, we
prove that the proposed algorithms converge at an R-linear (sublinear) rate for
both the iteration points and the objective function values. These results hold
without imposing stringent constraints on network width, depth, or training
data size. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze our parallel/distributed ADMM
algorithms, highlighting their reduced time complexity and lower per-node
memory consumption. To facilitate practical deployment, we develop a control
protocol for parallel ADMM implementation using Python's multiprocessing and
interprocess communication. Experimental results validate the proposed ADMM
algorithms, demonstrating rapid and stable convergence, improved performance,
and high computational efficiency. Finally, we highlight the improved
scalability and efficiency achieved by our parallel ADMM training strategy.

## Federated Structured Sparse PCA for Anomaly Detection in IoT Networks

**Categories:** cs.LG, math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23981v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Although federated learning has gained prominence as a privacy-preserving
framework tailored for distributed Internet of Things (IoT) environments,
current federated principal component analysis (PCA) methods lack integration
of sparsity, a critical feature for robust anomaly detection. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel federated structured sparse PCA (FedSSP)
approach for anomaly detection in IoT networks. The proposed model uniquely
integrates double sparsity regularization: (1) row-wise sparsity governed by
$\ell_{2,p}$-norm with $p\in[0,1)$ to eliminate redundant feature dimensions,
and (2) element-wise sparsity via $\ell_{q}$-norm with $q\in[0,1)$ to suppress
noise-sensitive components. To efficiently solve this non-convex optimization
problem in a distributed setting, we devise a proximal alternating minimization
(PAM) algorithm with rigorous theoretical proofs establishing its convergence
guarantees. Experiments on real datasets validate that incorporating structured
sparsity enhances both model interpretability and detection accuracy.

We propose a new manifold optimization method to solve low-rank problems with
sparse simplex constraints (variables are simultaneous nonnegativity, sparsity,

exploits oblique rotation manifolds, rewrite the problem, and introduce a new
Riemannian optimization method. Experiments on synthetic datasets compared to
the standard Euclidean method show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

## Organizations, teams, and job mobility: A social microdynamics approach

**Authors:** Bryan Adams, Valentín Vergara Hidd, Daniel Stimpson, Miesha Purcell, Eduardo López
**Categories:** cs.CE
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24117v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The internal structures of large organizations determine much of what occurs
inside including the way in which tasks are performed, the workers that perform
them, and the mobility of those workers within the organization. However,
regarding this latter process, most of the theoretical and modeling approaches
used to understand organizational worker mobility are highly stylized, using
idealizations such as structureless organizations, indistinguishable workers,
and a lack of social bonding of the workers. In this article, aided by a decade
of precise, temporally resolved data of a large US government organization, we
introduce a new model to describe organizations as composites of teams within
which individuals perform specific tasks and where social connections develop.
By tracking the personnel composition of organizational teams, we find that
workers that change jobs are highly influenced by preferring to reunite with
past co-workers. In this organization, 34\% of all moves lead to worker
reunions, a percentage well-above expectation. We find that the greater the
time workers spend together or the smaller the team they share both increase
their likelihood to reunite, supporting the notion of increased familiarity and
trust behind such reunions and the dominant role of social capital in the
evolution of large organizations.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23794v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in scientific
research. Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system
sizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on
reducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for
solving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In
this work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework
based on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly
updates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by
traditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various
systems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid,
demonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural,
dynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows
for forecast intervals up to $30\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps,
generating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than
4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended
timescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical
phenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments. An
open-source implementation of TrajCast is accessible under
https://github.com/IBM/trajcast.

## Physics-informed neural networks for hidden boundary detection and flow field reconstruction

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24074v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Simultaneously detecting hidden solid boundaries and reconstructing flow
fields from sparse observations poses a significant inverse challenge in fluid
mechanics. This study presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN)
framework designed to infer the presence, shape, and motion of static or moving
solid boundaries within a flow field. By integrating a body fraction parameter
into the governing equations, the model enforces no-slip/no-penetration
boundary conditions in solid regions while preserving conservation laws of
fluid dynamics. Using partial flow field data, the method simultaneously
reconstructs the unknown flow field and infers the body fraction distribution,
thereby revealing solid boundaries. The framework is validated across diverse
scenarios, including incompressible Navier-Stokes and compressible Euler flows,
such as steady flow past a fixed cylinder, an inline oscillating cylinder, and
subsonic flow over an airfoil. The results demonstrate accurate detection of
hidden boundaries, reconstruction of missing flow data, and estimation of
trajectories and velocities of a moving body. Further analysis examines the
effects of data sparsity, velocity-only measurements, and noise on inference
accuracy. The proposed method exhibits robustness and versatility, highlighting
its potential for applications when only limited experimental or numerical data
are available.

## Hybrid Random Concentrated Optimization Without Convexity Assumption

**Authors:** Pierre Bertrand, Michel Broniatowski, Wolfgang Stummer
**Categories:** physics.data-an
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23864v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We propose a method to minimize a continuous function over a subset
$\mathcal{S}$ of high-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^K$ without assuming
convexity. The method alternates between Global Search (GS) to identify
candidates and Concentrated Search (CS) regimes to improve an eligible
candidate in $\mathcal{S}$.Beyond the alternation between regimes, the
originality of the method lies in leveraging high dimensionality. We
demonstrate concentration properties under the $CS$ regime. In parallel, we
show that $GS$ reaches any point in finite time. Finally, two applications are
proposed. The first is the reduction of the $L_1$ norm in the Lasso to
demonstrate the relevance of the method. In a second application, we compress
neural network by pruning weights while maintaining performance. Our approach
achieves significant weight reduction with minimal performance loss, offering
an effective solution for network optimization.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This work explores generalizations of the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality (PLI)
and their implications for the convergence behavior of gradient flows in
optimization problems. Motivated by the continuous-time linear quadratic
regulator (CT-LQR) policy optimization problem -- where only a weaker version
of the PLI is characterized in the literature -- this work shows that while
weaker conditions are sufficient for global convergence to, and optimality of
the set of critical points of the cost function, the "profile" of the gradient
flow solution can change significantly depending on which "flavor" of
inequality the cost satisfies. After a general theoretical analysis, we focus
on fitting the CT-LQR policy optimization problem to the proposed framework,
showing that, in fact, it can never satisfy a PLI in its strongest form. We
follow up our analysis with a brief discussion on the difference between
continuous- and discrete-time LQR policy optimization, and end the paper with
some intuition on the extension of this framework to optimization problems with
L1 regularization and solved through proximal gradient flows.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Evolution equations, including both ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
and partial differential equations (PDEs), play a pivotal role in modeling
dynamic systems. However, achieving accurate long-time integration for these
equations remains a significant challenge. While physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free framework for solving PDEs, they often
suffer from temporal error accumulation, which limits their effectiveness in
capturing long-time behaviors. To alleviate this issue, we propose integral
regularization PINNs (IR-PINNs), a novel approach that enhances temporal
accuracy by incorporating an integral-based residual term into the loss
function. This method divides the entire time interval into smaller
sub-intervals and enforces constraints over these sub-intervals, thereby
improving the resolution and correlation of temporal dynamics. Furthermore,
IR-PINNs leverage adaptive sampling to dynamically refine the distribution of
collocation points based on the evolving solution, ensuring higher accuracy in
regions with sharp gradients or rapid variations. Numerical experiments on
benchmark problems demonstrate that IR-PINNs outperform original PINNs and
other state-of-the-art methods in capturing long-time behaviors, offering a
robust and accurate solution for evolution equations.

## On Speedups for Convex Optimization via Quantum Dynamics

**Authors:** Shouvanik Chakrabarti, Dylan Herman, Jacob Watkins, Enrico Fontana, Brandon Augustino, Junhyung Lyle Kim, Marco Pistoia
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.DS, math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24332v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We explore the potential for quantum speedups in convex optimization using
discrete simulations of the Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD) framework, as
proposed by Leng et al., and establish the first rigorous query complexity
bounds. We develop enhanced analyses for quantum simulation of Schr\"odinger
operators with black-box potential via the pseudo-spectral method, providing
explicit resource estimates independent of wavefunction assumptions. These
bounds are applied to assess the complexity of optimization through QHD. Our
findings pertain to unconstrained convex optimization in $d$ dimensions. In
continuous time, we demonstrate that QHD, with suitable parameters, can achieve
arbitrarily fast convergence rates. The optimization speed limit arises solely
from the discretization of the dynamics, mirroring a property of the classical
dynamics underlying QHD. Considering this cost, we show that a $G$-Lipschitz
convex function can be optimized to an error of $\epsilon$ with
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1.5}G^2 R^2/\epsilon^2)$ queries. Moreover, under
reasonable assumptions on the complexity of Hamiltonian simulation,
$\widetilde{\Omega}(d/\epsilon^2)$ queries are necessary. Thus, QHD does not
offer a speedup over classical zeroth order methods with exact oracles.
However, we demonstrate that the QHD algorithm tolerates
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^3/d^{1.5}G^2 R^2)$ noise in function
evaluation. We show that QHD offers a super-quadratic query advantage over all
known classical algorithms tolerating this level of evaluation noise in the
high-dimension regime. Additionally, we design a quantum algorithm for
stochastic convex optimization that provides a super-quadratic speedup over all
known classical algorithms in the high-dimension regime. To our knowledge,
these results represent the first rigorous quantum speedups for convex
optimization achieved through a dynamical algorithm.

## Implicit Bias and Fast Convergence Rates for Self-attention

**Authors:** Bhavya Vasudeva, Puneesh Deora, Christos Thrampoulidis
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.OC, stat.ML
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05738v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We study the fundamental optimization principles of self-attention, the
defining mechanism of transformers, by analyzing the implicit bias of
gradient-based optimizers in training a self-attention layer with a linear
decoder in binary classification. Building on prior studies in linear logistic
regression, recent findings demonstrate that the key-query matrix $W_t$ from
gradient-descent (GD) converges in direction towards $W_{mm}$, which maximizes
the margin between optimal and non-optimal tokens across sequences. However,
this convergence is local, dependent on initial conditions, only holds
asymptotically as the number of iterations increases, and leaves questions
about the potential benefits of adaptive step-size rules unaddressed. To bridge
this gap, we first establish scenarios for which convergence is provably
\emph{global}. We then analyze two adaptive step-size strategies: normalized GD
and Polyak step-size, demonstrating \emph{finite-time} convergence rates for
$W_t$ to $W_{mm}$, and quantifying the sparsification rate of the attention
map. These findings not only show that these strategies can accelerate
parameter convergence over standard GD in a non-convex setting but also deepen
the understanding of the implicit bias in self-attention, linking it more
closely to the phenomena observed in linear logistic regression despite its
intricate non-convex nature.

## Distributed Fractional Bayesian Learning for Adaptive Optimization

**Authors:** Yaqun Yang, Jinlong Lei, Guanghui Wen, Yiguang Hong
**Categories:** math.OC, cs.DC, cs.LG, cs.MA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11354v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This paper considers a distributed adaptive optimization problem, where all
agents only have access to their local cost functions with a common unknown
parameter, whereas they mean to collaboratively estimate the true parameter and
find the optimal solution over a connected network. A general mathematical
framework for such a problem has not been studied yet. We aim to provide
valuable insights for addressing parameter uncertainty in distributed
optimization problems and simultaneously find the optimal solution. Thus, we
propose a novel Prediction while Optimization scheme, which utilizes
distributed fractional Bayesian learning through weighted averaging on the
log-beliefs to update the beliefs of unknown parameters, and distributed
gradient descent for renewing the estimation of the optimal solution. Then
under suitable assumptions, we prove that all agents' beliefs and decision
variables converge almost surely to the true parameter and the optimal solution
under the true parameter, respectively. We further establish a sublinear
convergence rate for the belief sequence. Finally, numerical experiments are
implemented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.

## Efficient Learning for Entropy-Regularized Markov Decision Processes via Multilevel Monte Carlo

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21224v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Designing efficient learning algorithms with complexity guarantees for Markov
decision processes (MDPs) with large or continuous state and action spaces
remains a fundamental challenge. We address this challenge for
entropy-regularized MDPs with Polish state and action spaces, assuming access
to a generative model of the environment. We propose a novel family of
multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) algorithms that integrate fixed-point iteration
with MLMC techniques and a generic stochastic approximation of the Bellman
operator. We quantify the precise impact of the chosen approximate Bellman
operator on the accuracy of the resulting MLMC estimator. Leveraging this error
analysis, we show that using a biased plain MC estimate for the Bellman
operator results in quasi-polynomial sample complexity, whereas an unbiased
randomized multilevel approximation of the Bellman operator achieves polynomial
sample complexity in expectation. Notably, these complexity bounds are
independent of the dimensions or cardinalities of the state and action spaces,
distinguishing our approach from existing algorithms whose complexities scale
with the sizes of these spaces. We validate these theoretical performance
guarantees through numerical experiments.

## An extrapolated and provably convergent algorithm for nonlinear matrix decomposition with the ReLU function

**Authors:** Nicolas Gillis, Margherita Porcelli, Giovanni Seraghiti
**Categories:** cs.LG, eess.IV, math.OC, stat.ML, 15A23, 65F55, 68Q25, 90C26, 65K05
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23832v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Nonlinear matrix decomposition (NMD) with the ReLU function, denoted
ReLU-NMD, is the following problem: given a sparse, nonnegative matrix $X$ and
a factorization rank $r$, identify a rank-$r$ matrix $\Theta$ such that
$X\approx \max(0,\Theta)$. This decomposition finds application in data
compression, matrix completion with entries missing not at random, and manifold
learning. The standard ReLU-NMD model minimizes the least squares error, that
is, $\|X - \max(0,\Theta)\|_F^2$. The corresponding optimization problem is
nondifferentiable and highly nonconvex. This motivated Saul to propose an
alternative model, Latent-ReLU-NMD, where a latent variable $Z$ is introduced
and satisfies $\max(0,Z)=X$ while minimizing $\|Z - \Theta\|_F^2$ (``A
nonlinear matrix decomposition for mining the zeros of sparse data'', SIAM J.
Math. Data Sci., 2022). Our first contribution is to show that the two
formulations may yield different low-rank solutions $\Theta$; in particular, we
show that Latent-ReLU-NMD can be ill-posed when ReLU-NMD is not, meaning that
there are instances in which the infimum of Latent-ReLU-NMD is not attained
while that of ReLU-NMD is. We also consider another alternative model, called
3B-ReLU-NMD, which parameterizes $\Theta=WH$, where $W$ has $r$ columns and $H$
has $r$ rows, allowing one to get rid of the rank constraint in
Latent-ReLU-NMD. Our second contribution is to prove the convergence of a block
coordinate descent (BCD) applied to 3B-ReLU-NMD and referred to as BCD-NMD. Our
third contribution is a novel extrapolated variant of BCD-NMD, dubbed eBCD-NMD,
which we prove is also convergent under mild assumptions. We illustrate the
significant acceleration effect of eBCD-NMD compared to BCD-NMD, and also show
that eBCD-NMD performs well against the state of the art on synthetic and
real-world data sets.

## Certified Approximate Reachability (CARe): Formal Error Bounds on Deep Learning of Reachable Sets

**Authors:** Prashant Solanki, Nikolaus Vertovec, Yannik Schnitzer, Jasper Van Beers, Coen de Visser, Alessandro Abate
**Categories:** eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.SY, math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23912v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Recent approaches to leveraging deep learning for computing reachable sets of
continuous-time dynamical systems have gained popularity over traditional
level-set methods, as they overcome the curse of dimensionality. However, as
with level-set methods, considerable care needs to be taken in limiting
approximation errors, particularly since no guarantees are provided during
training on the accuracy of the learned reachable set. To address this
limitation, we introduce an epsilon-approximate Hamilton-Jacobi Partial
Differential Equation (HJ-PDE), which establishes a relationship between
training loss and accuracy of the true reachable set. To formally certify this
approximation, we leverage Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to
bound the residual error of the HJ-based loss function across the domain of
interest. Leveraging Counter Example Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS), we
close the loop around learning and verification, by fine-tuning the neural
network on counterexamples found by the SMT solver, thus improving the accuracy
of the learned reachable set. To the best of our knowledge, Certified
Approximate Reachability (CARe) is the first approach to provide soundness
guarantees on learned reachable sets of continuous dynamical systems.

## Faster Rates for No-Regret Learning in General Games via Cautious Optimism

**Authors:** Ashkan Soleymani, Georgios Piliouras, Gabriele Farina
**Categories:** cs.GT, cs.LG, math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24340v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We establish the first uncoupled learning algorithm that attains $O(n \log^2
d \log T)$ per-player regret in multi-player general-sum games, where $n$ is
the number of players, $d$ is the number of actions available to each player,
and $T$ is the number of repetitions of the game. Our results exponentially
improve the dependence on $d$ compared to the $O(n\, d \log T)$ regret
attainable by Log-Regularized Lifted Optimistic FTRL [Far+22c], and also reduce
the dependence on the number of iterations $T$ from $\log^4 T$ to $\log T$
compared to Optimistic Hedge, the previously well-studied algorithm with $O(n
\log d \log^4 T)$ regret [DFG21]. Our algorithm is obtained by combining the
classic Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update (OMWU) with an adaptive,
non-monotonic learning rate that paces the learning process of the players,
making them more cautious when their regret becomes too negative.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12491v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Soft-tissue and bone tumours (STBT) are rare, diagnostically challenging
lesions with variable clinical behaviours and treatment approaches. This
systematic review provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods
using radiological imaging for diagnosis and prognosis of these tumours,
highlighting challenges in clinical translation, and evaluating study alignment
with the Checklist for AI in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) and the FUTURE-AI
international consensus guidelines for trustworthy and deployable AI to promote
the clinical translation of AI methods. The review covered literature from
several bibliographic databases, including papers published before 17/07/2024.
Original research in peer-reviewed journals focused on radiology-based AI for
diagnosing or prognosing primary STBT was included. Exclusion criteria were
animal, cadaveric, or laboratory studies, and non-English papers. Abstracts
were screened by two of three independent reviewers for eligibility. Eligible
papers were assessed against guidelines by one of three independent reviewers.
The search identified 15,015 abstracts, from which 325 articles were included
for evaluation. Most studies performed moderately on CLAIM, averaging a score
of 28.9$\pm$7.5 out of 53, but poorly on FUTURE-AI, averaging 5.1$\pm$2.1 out
of 30. Imaging-AI tools for STBT remain at the proof-of-concept stage,
indicating significant room for improvement. Future efforts by AI developers
should focus on design (e.g. define unmet clinical need, intended clinical
setting and how AI would be integrated in clinical workflow), development (e.g.
build on previous work, explainability), evaluation (e.g. evaluating and
addressing biases, evaluating AI against best practices), and data
reproducibility and availability (making documented code and data publicly
available). Following these recommendations could improve clinical translation
of AI methods.

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23749v5
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Transformer-based architectures have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing and computer vision. However, their performance in
multivariate long-term forecasting often falls short compared to simpler linear
baselines. Previous research has identified the traditional attention mechanism
as a key factor limiting their effectiveness in this domain. To bridge this
gap, we introduce LATST, a novel approach designed to mitigate entropy collapse
and training instability common challenges in Transformer-based time series
forecasting. We rigorously evaluate LATST across multiple real-world
multivariate time series datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform
existing state-of-the-art Transformer models. Notably, LATST manages to achieve
competitive performance with fewer parameters than some linear models on
certain datasets, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

**Abstract:**
Personalized Federal learning(PFL) allows clients to cooperatively train a
personalized model without disclosing their private dataset. However, PFL
suffers from Non-IID, heterogeneous devices, lack of fairness, and unclear
contribution which urgently need the interpretability of deep learning model to
overcome these challenges. These challenges proposed new demands for
interpretability. Low cost, privacy, and detailed information. There is no
current interpretability method satisfying them. In this paper, we propose a
novel interpretability method \emph{FreqX} by introducing Signal Processing and
Information Theory. Our experiments show that the explanation results of FreqX
contain both attribution information and concept information. FreqX runs at
least 10 times faster than the baselines which contain concept information.

## PhD Knowledge Not Required: A Reasoning Challenge for Large Language Models

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01584v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Existing benchmarks for frontier models often test specialized, "PhD-level"
knowledge that is difficult for non-experts to grasp. In contrast, we present a
benchmark with 594 problems based on the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge that
requires only general knowledge. Our benchmark is challenging for both humans
and models; however correct solutions are easy to verify, and models' mistakes
are easy to spot. As LLMs are more widely deployed in society, we believe it is
useful to develop benchmarks for frontier models that humans can understand
without the need for deep domain expertise.
  Our work reveals capability gaps that are not evident in existing benchmarks:
OpenAI o1 significantly outperforms other reasoning models on our benchmark,
despite being on par with other models when tested on benchmarks that test
specialized knowledge. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning outputs uncovers
new kinds of failures. DeepSeek R1, for instance, often concedes with "I give
up" before providing an answer that it knows is wrong. R1 can also be
remarkably "uncertain" in its output and in rare cases, it does not "finish
thinking," which suggests the need for techniques to "wrap up" before the
context window limit is reached. We also quantify the effectiveness of
reasoning longer to identify the point beyond which more reasoning is unlikely
to improve accuracy on our benchmark.

## XAMBA: Enabling Efficient State Space Models on Resource-Constrained Neural Processing Units

**Authors:** Arghadip Das, Arnab Raha, Shamik Kundu, Soumendu Kumar Ghosh, Deepak Mathaikutty, Vijay Raghunathan
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06924v4
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
State-Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
transformers for sequential data tasks, offering linear or near-linear
scalability with sequence length, making them ideal for long-sequence
applications in NLP, vision, and edge AI, including real-time transcription,
translation, and contextual search. These applications require lightweight,
high-performance models for deployment on resource-constrained devices like
laptops and PCs. Designing specialized accelerators for every emerging neural
network is costly and impractical; instead, optimizing models for existing NPUs
in AI PCs provides a scalable solution. To this end, we propose XAMBA, the
first framework to enable and optimize SSMs on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
state-of-the-art (SOTA) NPUs. XAMBA follows a three-step methodology: (1)
enabling SSMs on NPUs, (2) optimizing performance to meet KPI requirements, and
(3) trading accuracy for additional performance gains. After enabling SSMs on
NPUs, XAMBA mitigates key bottlenecks using CumBA and ReduBA, replacing
sequential CumSum and ReduceSum operations with matrix-based computations,
significantly improving execution speed and memory efficiency. Additionally,
ActiBA enhances performance by approximating expensive activation functions
(e.g., Swish, Softplus) using piecewise linear mappings, reducing latency with
minimal accuracy loss. Evaluations on an Intel Core Ultra Series 2 AI PC show
that XAMBA achieves up to 4.8X speed-up over the baseline. Our implementation
is available at https://github.com/arghadippurdue/XAMBA.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
DeepSeek-R1, known for its low training cost and exceptional reasoning
capabilities, has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.
However, detailed evaluations for DeepSeek Series models from the perspective
of real-world applications are lacking, making it challenging for users to
select the most suitable DeepSeek models for their specific needs. To address
this gap, we conduct a systematic evaluation of the DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama series, their
corresponding 4-bit quantized models, and the reasoning model QwQ-32B using the
enhanced A-Eval benchmark, A-Eval-2.0. Through a comparative analysis of
original instruction-tuned models and their distilled counterparts, we
investigate how reasoning enhancements impact performance across diverse
practical tasks. To assist users in model selection, we quantify the capability
boundary of DeepSeek models through performance tier classifications. Based on
the quantification results, we develop a model selection handbook that clearly
illustrates the relation among models, their capabilities and practical
applications. This handbook enables users to select the most cost-effective
models without efforts, ensuring optimal performance and resource efficiency in
real-world applications. It should be noted that, despite our efforts to
establish a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative evaluation benchmark,
the selection of test samples, characteristics of data distribution, and the
setting of evaluation criteria may inevitably introduce certain biases into the
evaluation results. We will continuously optimize the evaluation benchmarks and
periodically update this paper to provide more comprehensive and accurate
evaluation results. Please refer to the latest version of the paper for the
most current results and conclusions.

## Studying the Interplay Between the Actor and Critic Representations in Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Samuel Garcin, Trevor McInroe, Pablo Samuel Castro, Prakash Panangaden, Christopher G. Lucas, David Abel, Stefano V. Albrecht
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06343v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Extracting relevant information from a stream of high-dimensional
observations is a central challenge for deep reinforcement learning agents.
Actor-critic algorithms add further complexity to this challenge, as it is
often unclear whether the same information will be relevant to both the actor
and the critic. To this end, we here explore the principles that underlie
effective representations for the actor and for the critic in on-policy
algorithms. We focus our study on understanding whether the actor and critic
will benefit from separate, rather than shared, representations. Our primary
finding is that when separated, the representations for the actor and critic
systematically specialise in extracting different types of information from the
environment -- the actor's representation tends to focus on action-relevant
information, while the critic's representation specialises in encoding value
and dynamics information. We conduct a rigourous empirical study to understand
how different representation learning approaches affect the actor and critic's
specialisations and their downstream performance, in terms of sample efficiency
and generation capabilities. Finally, we discover that a separated critic plays
an important role in exploration and data collection during training. Our code,
trained models and data are accessible at

## Entropy-guided sequence weighting for efficient exploration in RL-based LLM fine-tuning

**Authors:** Abdullah Vanlioglu
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22456v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We introduce Entropy-Guided Sequence Weighting (EGSW), a novel approach that
enhances the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by dynamically assigning weights
to generated outputs based on their advantage and entropy for Reinforcement
Learning-based Large Language Model fine-tuning. EGSW integrates entropy
regularization with advantage-based weighting to balance policy updates,
enabling efficient exploration in high-dimensional state spaces. By employing
temperature-scaled softmax weighting over sequences, EGSW prioritizing
high-reward, high-uncertainty steps while maintaining training stability.
Although originally developed to improve Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) during large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, EGSW is generalizable to
other reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and can be implemented in both
step-wise and trajectory-wise settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
EGSW enhances GRPO reasoning ability, yielding improvements in sample
efficiency. Future work will explore the application of EGSW to advanced RL
methodologies.

## Unimodal-driven Distillation in Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Dynamic Fusion

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23721v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (MERC) identifies emotional
states across text, audio and video, which is essential for intelligent
dialogue systems and opinion analysis. Existing methods emphasize heterogeneous
modal fusion directly for cross-modal integration, but often suffer from
disorientation in multimodal learning due to modal heterogeneity and lack of
instructive guidance. In this work, we propose SUMMER, a novel heterogeneous
multimodal integration framework leveraging Mixture of Experts with
Hierarchical Cross-modal Fusion and Interactive Knowledge Distillation. Key
components include a Sparse Dynamic Mixture of Experts (SDMoE) for capturing
dynamic token-wise interactions, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion (HCMF) for
effective fusion of heterogeneous modalities, and Interactive Knowledge
Distillation (IKD), which uses a pre-trained unimodal teacher to guide
multimodal fusion in latent and logit spaces. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD
show SUMMER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in recognizing
minority and semantically similar emotions.

## When Counterfactual Reasoning Fails: Chaos and Real-World Complexity

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23820v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Counterfactual reasoning, a cornerstone of human cognition and
decision-making, is often seen as the 'holy grail' of causal learning, with
applications ranging from interpreting machine learning models to promoting
algorithmic fairness. While counterfactual reasoning has been extensively
studied in contexts where the underlying causal model is well-defined,
real-world causal modeling is often hindered by model and parameter
uncertainty, observational noise, and chaotic behavior. The reliability of
counterfactual analysis in such settings remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we investigate the limitations of counterfactual reasoning within the
framework of Structural Causal Models. Specifically, we empirically investigate
\emph{counterfactual sequence estimation} and highlight cases where it becomes
increasingly unreliable. We find that realistic assumptions, such as low
degrees of model uncertainty or chaotic dynamics, can result in
counterintuitive outcomes, including dramatic deviations between predicted and
true counterfactual trajectories. This work urges caution when applying
counterfactual reasoning in settings characterized by chaos and uncertainty.
Furthermore, it raises the question of whether certain systems may pose
fundamental limitations on the ability to answer counterfactual questions about
their behavior.

## Green MLOps to Green GenOps: An Empirical Study of Energy Consumption in Discriminative and Generative AI Operations

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23934v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This study presents an empirical investigation into the energy consumption of
Discriminative and Generative AI models within real-world MLOps pipelines. For
Discriminative models, we examine various architectures and hyperparameters
during training and inference and identify energy-efficient practices. For
Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) are assessed, focusing primarily on
energy consumption across different model sizes and varying service requests.
Our study employs software-based power measurements, ensuring ease of
replication across diverse configurations, models, and datasets. We analyse
multiple models and hardware setups to uncover correlations among various
metrics, identifying key contributors to energy consumption. The results
indicate that for Discriminative models, optimising architectures,
hyperparameters, and hardware can significantly reduce energy consumption
without sacrificing performance. For LLMs, energy efficiency depends on
balancing model size, reasoning complexity, and request-handling capacity, as
larger models do not necessarily consume more energy when utilisation remains
low. This analysis provides practical guidelines for designing green and
sustainable ML operations, emphasising energy consumption and carbon footprint
reductions while maintaining performance. This paper can serve as a benchmark
for accurately estimating total energy use across different types of AI models.

**Abstract:**
Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to significant
improvements in task performance. However, training neural networks in an RL
regime is typically achieved in combination with backpropagation, limiting
their applicability in resource-constrained environments or when using
non-differentiable neural networks. While noise-based alternatives like
reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL) have been proposed, their performance
has remained limited, especially in scenarios with delayed rewards, which
require retrospective credit assignment over time. Here, we derive a novel
noise-based learning rule that addresses these challenges. Our approach
combines directional derivative theory with Hebbian-like updates to enable
efficient, gradient-free learning in RL. It features stochastic noisy neurons
which can approximate gradients, and produces local synaptic updates modulated
by a global reward signal. Drawing on concepts from neuroscience, our method
uses reward prediction error as its optimization target to generate
increasingly advantageous behavior, and incorporates an eligibility trace to
facilitate temporal credit assignment in environments with delayed rewards. Its
formulation relies on local information alone, making it compatible with
implementations in neuromorphic hardware. Experimental validation shows that
our approach significantly outperforms RMHL and is competitive with BP-based
baselines, highlighting the promise of noise-based, biologically inspired
learning for low-power and real-time applications.

## Rethinking Key-Value Cache Compression Techniques for Large Language Model Serving

**Authors:** Wei Gao, Xinyu Zhou, Peng Sun, Tianwei Zhang, Yonggang Wen
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24000v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Key-Value cache (\texttt{KV} \texttt{cache}) compression has emerged as a
promising technique to optimize Large Language Model (LLM) serving. It
primarily decreases the memory consumption of \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} to
reduce the computation cost. Despite the development of many compression
algorithms, their applications in production environments are still not
prevalent. In this paper, we revisit mainstream \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache}
compression solutions from a practical perspective. Our contributions are
three-fold. First, we comprehensively review existing algorithmic designs and
benchmark studies for \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression and identify
missing pieces in their performance measurement, which could hinder their
adoption in practice. Second, we empirically evaluate representative
\texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression methods to uncover two key issues that
affect the computational efficiency: (1) while compressing \texttt{KV}
\texttt{cache} can reduce memory consumption, current implementations (e.g.,
FlashAttention, PagedAttention) do not optimize for production-level LLM
serving, resulting in suboptimal throughput performance; (2) compressing
\texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} may lead to longer outputs, resulting in increased
end-to-end latency. We further investigate the accuracy performance of
individual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic
limitations in \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression when handling specific
LLM tasks. Third, we provide tools to shed light on future \texttt{KV}
\texttt{cache} compression studies and facilitate their practical deployment in
production. They are open-sourced in

## CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting

**Authors:** Yosuke Yamaguchi, Issei Suemitsu, Wenpeng Wei
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24007v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Covariates play an indispensable role in practical time series forecasting,
offering rich context from the past and sometimes extending into the future.
However, their availability varies depending on the scenario, and situations
often involve multiple target variables simultaneously. Moreover, the
cross-variate dependencies between them are multi-granular, with some
covariates having a short-term impact on target variables and others showing
long-term correlations. This heterogeneity and the intricate dependencies
arising in covariate-informed forecasting present significant challenges to
existing deep models. To address these issues, we propose CITRAS, a patch-based
Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets and covariates covering
both the past and the future forecasting horizon. While preserving the strong
autoregressive capabilities of the canonical Transformer, CITRAS introduces two
novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift
and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future known
covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent
dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing transforms locally
accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level
dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally,
CITRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covariate-informed and
multivariate forecasting, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage
cross-variate dependency for improved forecasting accuracy.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24165v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer death globally, with non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) emerging as its most prevalent subtype. Among NSCLC
patients, approximately 32.3% have mutations in the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC
patients with activating and T790M resistance EGFR mutations. Despite its
established efficacy, drug resistance poses a significant challenge for
patients to fully benefit from osimertinib. The absence of a standard tool to
accurately predict TKI resistance, including that of osimertinib, remains a
critical obstacle. To bridge this gap, in this study, we developed an
interpretable multimodal machine learning model designed to predict patient
resistance to osimertinib among late-stage NSCLC patients with activating EGFR
mutations, achieving a c-index of 0.82 on a multi-institutional dataset. This
machine learning model harnesses readily available data routinely collected
during patient visits and medical assessments to facilitate precision lung
cancer management and informed treatment decisions. By integrating various data
types such as histology images, next generation sequencing (NGS) data,
demographics data, and clinical records, our multimodal model can generate
well-informed recommendations. Our experiment results also demonstrated the
superior performance of the multimodal model over single modality models
(c-index 0.82 compared with 0.75 and 0.77), thus underscoring the benefit of
combining multiple modalities in patient outcome prediction.

## Evaluating and Designing Sparse Autoencoders by Approximating Quasi-Orthogonality

**Authors:** Sewoong Lee, Adam Davies, Marc E. Canby, Julia Hockenmaier
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24277v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a workhorse of modern mechanistic
interpretability, but leading SAE approaches with top-$k$ style activation
functions lack theoretical grounding for selecting the hyperparameter $k$. SAEs
are based on the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which assumes that the
representations of large language models (LLMs) are linearly encoded, and the
superposition hypothesis (SH), which states that there can be more features in
the model than its dimensionality. We show that, based on the formal
definitions of the LRH and SH, the magnitude of sparse feature vectors (the
latent representations learned by SAEs of the dense embeddings of LLMs) can be
approximated using their corresponding dense vector with a closed-form error
bound. To visualize this, we propose the ZF plot, which reveals a previously
unknown relationship between LLM hidden embeddings and SAE feature vectors,
allowing us to make the first empirical measurement of the extent to which
feature vectors of pre-trained SAEs are over- or under-activated for a given
input. Correspondingly, we introduce Approximate Feature Activation (AFA),
which approximates the magnitude of the ground-truth sparse feature vector, and
propose a new evaluation metric derived from AFA to assess the alignment
between inputs and activations. We also leverage AFA to introduce a novel SAE
architecture, the top-AFA SAE, leading to SAEs that: (a) are more in line with
theoretical justifications; and (b) obviate the need to tune SAE sparsity
hyperparameters. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that top-AFA SAEs achieve
reconstruction loss comparable to that of state-of-the-art top-k SAEs, without
requiring the hyperparameter $k$ to be tuned. Our code is available at:

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Small molecules play a critical role in the biomedical, environmental, and
agrochemical domains, each with distinct physicochemical requirements and
success criteria. Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets
and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with
respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most
comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the
honey bee (\textit{Apis mellifera}), an ecologically vital pollinator. We
evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches,
including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as
well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from
the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical
space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox,
demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art
algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for
more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the
agrochemical domain.

## Contextual Preference Collaborative Measure Framework Based on Belief System

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24328v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
To reduce the human intervention in the preference measure process,this
article proposes a preference collaborative measure framework based on an
updated belief system,which is also capable of improving the accuracy and
efficiency of preferen-ce measure algorithms.Firstly,the distance of rules and
the average internal distance of rulesets are proposed for specifying the
relationship between the rules.For discovering the most representative
preferences that are common in all users,namely common preference,a algorithm
based on average internal distance of ruleset,PRA algorithm,is proposed,which
aims to finish the discoveryprocess with minimum information loss
rate.Furthermore,the concept of Common belief is proposed to update the belief
system,and the common preferences are the evidences of updated belief
system.Then,under the belief system,the proposed belief degree and deviation
degree are used to determine whether a rule confirms the belief system or not
and classify the preference rules into two kinds(generalized or
personalized),and eventually filters out Top-K interesting rules relying on
belief degree and deviation degree.Based on above,a scalable interestingness
calculation framework that can apply various formulas is proposed for
accurately calculating interestingness in different conditions.At last,IMCos
algorithm and IMCov algorithm are proposed as exemplars to verify the accuracy
and efficiency of the framework by using weighted cosine similarity and
correlation coefficients as belief degree.In experiments,the proposed
algorithms are compared to two state-of-the-art algorithms and the results show
that IMCos and IMCov outperform than the other two in most aspects.

**Abstract:**
As neural networks become dominant in essential systems, Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in fostering trust and
detecting potential misbehavior of opaque models. LIME (Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations) is among the most prominent model-agnostic
approaches, generating explanations by approximating the behavior of black-box
models around specific instances. Despite its popularity, LIME faces challenges
related to fidelity, stability, and applicability to domain-specific problems.
Numerous adaptations and enhancements have been proposed to address these
issues, but the growing number of developments can be overwhelming,
complicating efforts to navigate LIME-related research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first survey to comprehensively explore and collect
LIME's foundational concepts and known limitations. We categorize and compare
its various enhancements, offering a structured taxonomy based on intermediate
steps and key issues. Our analysis provides a holistic overview of advancements
in LIME, guiding future research and helping practitioners identify suitable
approaches. Additionally, we provide a continuously updated interactive website
(https://patrick-knab.github.io/which-lime-to-trust/), offering a concise and
accessible overview of the survey.

## Inductive Graph Representation Learning with Quantum Graph Neural Networks

**Authors:** Arthur M. Faria, Ignacio F. Graña, Savvas Varsamopoulos
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24111v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) present a promising approach for
combining quantum computing with graph-structured data processing. While
classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are renowned for their scalability and
robustness, existing QGNNs often lack flexibility due to graph-specific quantum
circuit designs, limiting their applicability to a narrower range of
graph-structured problems, falling short of real-world scenarios. To address
these limitations, we propose a versatile QGNN framework inspired by the
classical GraphSAGE approach, utilizing quantum models as aggregators. In this
work, we integrate established techniques for inductive representation learning
on graphs with parametrized quantum convolutional and pooling layers,
effectively bridging classical and quantum paradigms. The convolutional layer
is flexible, enabling tailored designs for specific problems. Benchmarked on a
node regression task with the QM9 dataset, we demonstrate that our framework
successfully models a non-trivial molecular dataset, achieving performance
comparable to classical GNNs. In particular, we show that our quantum approach
exhibits robust generalization across molecules with varying numbers of atoms
without requiring circuit modifications, slightly outperforming classical GNNs.
Furthermore, we numerically investigate the scalability of the QGNN framework.
Specifically, we demonstrate the absence of barren plateaus in our architecture
as the number of qubits increases, suggesting that the proposed quantum model
can be extended to handle larger and more complex graph-based problems
effectively.

**Categories:** physics.comp-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18807v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Direct minimization method on the complex Stiefel manifold in Kohn-Sham
density functional theory is formulated to treat both finite and extended
systems in a unified manner. This formulation is well-suited for scenarios
where straightforward iterative diagonalization becomes challenging, especially
when the Aufbau principle is not applicable. We present the theoretical
foundation and numerical implementation of the Riemannian conjugate gradient
(RCG)
  within a localized non-orthogonal basis set. Riemannian
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) method is tentatively implemented.
Extensive testing compares the performance of the proposed methods
  and highlights that the quasi-Newton method is more efficient. However, for
extended systems, the computational time required grows rapidly with respect to
the number of $\bk$-points.

## Pyrometheus: Symbolic abstractions for XPU and automatically differentiated computation of combustion kinetics and thermodynamics

**Authors:** Esteban Cisneros-Garibay, Henry Le Berre, Spencer H. Bryngelson, Jonathan B. Freund
**Categories:** physics.comp-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24286v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The cost of combustion simulations is often dominated by the evaluation of
net production rates of chemical species and mixture thermodynamics
(thermochemistry). Execution on computing accelerators (XPUs) like graphic
processing units (GPUs) can greatly reduce this cost. However, established
thermochemistry software is not readily portable to such devices or sacrifices
valuable analytical forms that enable differentiation for sensitivity analysis
and implicit time integration. Symbolic abstractions are developed with
corresponding transformations that enable computation on accelerators and
automatic differentiation by avoiding premature specification of detail. The
software package Pyrometheus is introduced as an implementation of these
abstractions and their transformations for combustion thermochemistry. The
formulation facilitates code generation from the symbolic representation of a
specific thermochemical mechanism in multiple target languages, including
Python, C++, and Fortran. Computational concerns are separated: the generated
code processes array-valued expressions but does not specify their semantics.
These semantics are provided by compatible array libraries, such as NumPy,
Pytato, and Google JAX. Thus, the generated code retains a symbolic
representation of the thermochemistry, which translates to computation on
accelerators and CPUs and automatic differentiation. The design and operation
of these symbolic abstractions and their companion tool, Pyrometheus, are
discussed throughout. Roofline demonstrations show that the computation of
chemical source terms within MFC, a Fortran-based flow solver we link to
Pyrometheus, is performant.

## Boost Your Human Image Generation Model via Direct Preference Optimization

**Authors:** Sanghyeon Na, Yonggyu Kim, Hyunjoon Lee

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20216v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Human image generation is a key focus in image synthesis due to its broad
applications, but even slight inaccuracies in anatomy, pose, or details can
compromise realism. To address these challenges, we explore Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), which trains models to generate preferred (winning) images
while diverging from non-preferred (losing) ones. However, conventional DPO
methods use generated images as winning images, limiting realism. To overcome
this limitation, we propose an enhanced DPO approach that incorporates
high-quality real images as winning images, encouraging outputs to resemble
real images rather than generated ones. However, implementing this concept is
not a trivial task. Therefore, our approach, HG-DPO (Human image Generation
through DPO), employs a novel curriculum learning framework that gradually
improves the output of the model toward greater realism, making training more
feasible. Furthermore, HG-DPO effectively adapts to personalized text-to-image
tasks, generating high-quality and identity-specific images, which highlights
the practical value of our approach.

## Training-Free Exponential Context Extension via Cascading KV Cache

**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17808v4
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning
and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory.
However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow
quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in
real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV
Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the
stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information.
Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in
higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In
response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache
buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to
maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our
approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including
streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey
retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four
doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill
stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens.
These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but
also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained
environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly
reduced latency.

## ShapG: new feature importance method based on the Shapley value

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00506v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
With wide application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), it has become
particularly important to make decisions of AI systems explainable and
transparent. In this paper, we proposed a new Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) method called ShapG (Explanations based on Shapley value for
Graphs) for measuring feature importance. ShapG is a model-agnostic global
explanation method. At the first stage, it defines an undirected graph based on
the dataset, where nodes represent features and edges are added based on
calculation of correlation coefficients between features. At the second stage,
it calculates an approximated Shapley value by sampling the data taking into
account this graph structure. The sampling approach of ShapG allows to
calculate the importance of features efficiently, i.e. to reduce computational
complexity. Comparison of ShapG with other existing XAI methods shows that it
provides more accurate explanations for two examined datasets. We also compared
other XAI methods developed based on cooperative game theory with ShapG in
running time, and the results show that ShapG exhibits obvious advantages in
its running time, which further proves efficiency of ShapG. In addition,
extensive experiments demonstrate a wide range of applicability of the ShapG
method for explaining complex models. We find ShapG an important tool in
improving explainability and transparency of AI systems and believe it can be
widely used in various fields.

## Backdoor Graph Condensation

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11025v4
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Graph condensation has recently emerged as a prevalent technique to improve
the training efficiency for graph neural networks (GNNs). It condenses a large
graph into a small one such that a GNN trained on this small synthetic graph
can achieve comparable performance to a GNN trained on the large graph.
However, while existing graph condensation studies mainly focus on the best
trade-off between graph size and the GNNs' performance (model utility), they
overlook the security issues of graph condensation. To bridge this gap, we
first explore backdoor attack against the GNNs trained on the condensed graphs.
  We introduce an effective backdoor attack against graph condensation, termed
BGC. This attack aims to (1) preserve the condensed graph quality despite
trigger injection, and (2) ensure trigger efficacy through the condensation
process, achieving a high attack success rate. Specifically, BGC consistently
updates triggers during condensation and targets representative nodes for
poisoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack.
BGC achieves a high attack success rate (close to 1.0) and good model utility
in all cases. Furthermore, the results against multiple defense methods
demonstrate BGC's resilience under their defenses. Finally, we analyze the key
hyperparameters that influence the attack performance. Our code is available
at: https://github.com/JiahaoWuGit/BGC.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The advancements of large language models (LLMs) have piqued growing interest
in developing LLM-based language agents to automate scientific discovery
end-to-end, which has sparked both excitement and skepticism about their true
capabilities. In this work, we call for rigorous assessment of agents on
individual tasks in a scientific workflow before making bold claims on
end-to-end automation. To this end, we present ScienceAgentBench, a new
benchmark for evaluating language agents for data-driven scientific discovery.
To ensure the scientific authenticity and real-world relevance of our
benchmark, we extract 102 tasks from 44 peer-reviewed publications in four
disciplines and engage nine subject matter experts to validate them. We unify
the target output for every task to a self-contained Python program file and
employ an array of evaluation metrics to examine the generated programs,
execution results, and costs. Each task goes through multiple rounds of manual
validation by annotators and subject matter experts to ensure its annotation
quality and scientific plausibility. We also propose two effective strategies
to mitigate data contamination concerns. Using ScienceAgentBench, we evaluate
five open-weight and proprietary LLMs, each with three frameworks: direct
prompting, OpenHands CodeAct, and self-debug. Given three attempts for each
task, the best-performing agent can only solve 32.4% of the tasks independently
and 34.3% with expert-provided knowledge. In addition, we evaluate OpenAI
o1-preview with direct prompting and self-debug, which can boost the
performance to 42.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of increasing
inference-time compute but with more than 10 times the cost of other LLMs.
Still, our results underscore the limitations of current language agents in
generating code for data-driven discovery, let alone end-to-end automation for
scientific research.

## Are Large Language Models Memorizing Bug Benchmarks?

**Authors:** Daniel Ramos, Claudia Mamede, Kush Jain, Paulo Canelas, Catarina Gamboa, Claire Le Goues
**Categories:** cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13323v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to various software
engineering tasks, including code generation, bug detection, and repair. To
evaluate model performance in these domains, numerous bug benchmarks containing
real-world bugs from software projects have been developed. However, a growing
concern within the software engineering community is that these benchmarks may
not reliably reflect true LLM performance due to the risk of data leakage.
Despite this concern, limited research has been conducted to quantify the
impact of potential leakage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate popular
LLMs to assess their susceptibility to data leakage from widely used bug
benchmarks. To identify potential leakage, we use multiple metrics, including a
study of benchmark membership within commonly used training datasets, as well
as analyses of negative log-likelihood and n-gram accuracy. Our findings show
that certain models, in particular codegen-multi, exhibit significant evidence
of memorization in widely used benchmarks like Defects4J, while newer models
trained on larger datasets like LLaMa 3.1 exhibit limited signs of leakage.
These results highlight the need for careful benchmark selection and the
adoption of robust metrics to adequately assess models capabilities.

## Evil twins are not that evil: Qualitative insights into machine-generated prompts

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08127v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
It has been widely observed that language models (LMs) respond in predictable
ways to algorithmically generated prompts that are seemingly unintelligible.
This is both a sign that we lack a full understanding of how LMs work, and a
practical challenge, because opaqueness can be exploited for harmful uses of
LMs, such as jailbreaking. We present the first thorough analysis of opaque
machine-generated prompts, or autoprompts, pertaining to 6 LMs of different
sizes and families. We find that machine-generated prompts are characterized by
a last token that is often intelligible and strongly affects the generation. A
small but consistent proportion of the previous tokens are prunable, probably
appearing in the prompt as a by-product of the fact that the optimization
process fixes the number of tokens. The remaining tokens fall into two
categories: filler tokens, which can be replaced with semantically unrelated
substitutes, and keywords, that tend to have at least a loose semantic relation
with the generation, although they do not engage in well-formed syntactic
relations with it. Additionally, human experts can reliably identify the most
influential tokens in an autoprompt a posteriori, suggesting these prompts are
not entirely opaque. Finally, some of the ablations we applied to autoprompts
yield similar effects in natural language inputs, suggesting that autoprompts
emerge naturally from the way LMs process linguistic inputs in general.

**Abstract:**
This paper presents a novel methodological framework for detecting and
classifying latent constructs, including frames, narratives, and topics, from
textual data using Open-Source Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed
hybrid approach combines automated summarization with human-in-the-loop
validation to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of construct

the framework guarantees methodological robustness and ensures conceptual
precision. Applied to diverse data sets, including AI policy debates, newspaper
articles on encryption, and the 20 Newsgroups data set, this approach
demonstrates its versatility in systematically analyzing complex political
discourses, media framing, and topic classification tasks.

Diffusion models and Flow Matching generate high-quality samples but are slow

instability and extensive tuning. To resolve these trade-offs, we propose
Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a new class of generative models for one- or
few-step sampling with a single-stage training procedure. Unlike distillation,
IMM does not require pre-training initialization and optimization of two
networks; and unlike Consistency Models, IMM guarantees distribution-level
convergence and remains stable under various hyperparameters and standard model
architectures. IMM surpasses diffusion models on ImageNet-256x256 with 1.99 FID
using only 8 inference steps and achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98
on CIFAR-10 for a model trained from scratch.

## LoRA Subtraction for Drift-Resistant Space in Exemplar-Free Continual Learning

**Authors:** Xuan Liu, Xiaobin Chang
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, stat.ML
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18985v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In continual learning (CL), catastrophic forgetting often arises due to
feature drift. This challenge is particularly prominent in the exemplar-free
continual learning (EFCL) setting, where samples from previous tasks cannot be
retained, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. To address this
issue, some EFCL methods aim to identify feature spaces that minimize the
impact on previous tasks while accommodating new ones. However, they rely on
static features or outdated statistics stored from old tasks, which prevents
them from capturing the dynamic evolution of the feature space in CL, leading
to performance degradation over time. In this paper, we introduce the
Drift-Resistant Space (DRS), which effectively handles feature drifts without
requiring explicit feature modeling or the storage of previous tasks. A novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach called Low-Rank Adaptation Subtraction
(LoRA-) is proposed to develop the DRS. This method subtracts the LoRA weights
of old tasks from the initial pre-trained weight before processing new task
data to establish the DRS for model training. Therefore, LoRA- enhances
stability, improves efficiency, and simplifies implementation. Furthermore,
stabilizing feature drifts allows for better plasticity by learning with a
triplet loss. Our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art results,
especially for long task sequences, across multiple datasets.

## The Mathematical Relationship Between Layer Normalization and Dynamic Activation Functions

**Authors:** Felix Stollenwerk

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21708v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
A recent paper proposes Dynamic Tanh (DyT) as a drop-in replacement for layer
normalization (LN). Although the method is empirically well-motivated and
appealing from a practical point of view, it lacks a theoretical foundation. In
this work, we shed light on the mathematical relationship between layer
normalization and dynamic activation functions. In particular, we derive DyT
from LN and show that a well-defined approximation is needed to do so. By
dropping said approximation, an alternative activation function is obtained,
which we call Dynamic Inverse Square Root Unit (DyISRU). DyISRU is the exact
counterpart of layer normalization, and we demonstrate numerically that it
indeed resembles LN more accurately than DyT does.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21804v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HRKGs) extend traditional KGs beyond
binary relations, enabling the representation of contextual, provenance, and
temporal information in domains, such as historical events, sensor data, video
content, and narratives. HRKGs can be structured using several Metadata
Representation Models (MRMs), including Reification (REF), Singleton Property
(SGP), and RDF-star (RDR). However, the effects of different MRMs on KG
Embedding (KGE) and Link Prediction (LP) models remain unclear. This study
evaluates MRMs in the context of LP tasks, identifies the limitations of
existing evaluation frameworks, and introduces a new task that ensures fair
comparisons across MRMs. Furthermore, we propose a framework that effectively
reflects the knowledge representations of the three MRMs in latent space.
Experiments on two types of datasets reveal that REF performs well in simple
HRKGs, whereas SGP is less effective. However, in complex HRKGs, the
differences among MRMs in the LP tasks are minimal. Our findings contribute to
an optimal knowledge representation strategy for HRKGs in LP tasks.

## Conformal uncertainty quantification to evaluate predictive fairness of foundation AI model for skin lesion classes across patient demographics

**Authors:** Swarnava Bhattacharyya, Umapada Pal, Tapabrata Chakraborti

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23819v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Deep learning based diagnostic AI systems based on medical images are
starting to provide similar performance as human experts. However these data
hungry complex systems are inherently black boxes and therefore slow to be
adopted for high risk applications like healthcare. This problem of lack of
transparency is exacerbated in the case of recent large foundation models,
which are trained in a self supervised manner on millions of data points to
provide robust generalisation across a range of downstream tasks, but the
embeddings generated from them happen through a process that is not
interpretable, and hence not easily trustable for clinical applications. To
address this timely issue, we deploy conformal analysis to quantify the
predictive uncertainty of a vision transformer (ViT) based foundation model
across patient demographics with respect to sex, age and ethnicity for the
tasks of skin lesion classification using several public benchmark datasets.
The significant advantage of this method is that conformal analysis is method
independent and it not only provides a coverage guarantee at population level
but also provides an uncertainty score for each individual. We used a
model-agnostic dynamic F1-score-based sampling during model training, which
helped to stabilize the class imbalance and we investigate the effects on
uncertainty quantification (UQ) with or without this bias mitigation step. Thus
we show how this can be used as a fairness metric to evaluate the robustness of
the feature embeddings of the foundation model (Google DermFoundation) and thus
advance the trustworthiness and fairness of clinical AI.

## DiffScale: Continuous Downscaling and Bias Correction of Subseasonal Wind Speed Forecasts using Diffusion Models

**Authors:** Maximilian Springenberg, Noelia Otero, Yuxin Xue, Jackie Ma

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23893v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Renewable resources are strongly dependent on local and large-scale weather
situations. Skillful subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts -- beyond two
weeks and up to two months -- can offer significant socioeconomic advantages to
the energy sector. This study aims to enhance wind speed predictions using a
diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to downscale S2S forecasts of
surface wind speed. We propose DiffScale, a diffusion model that super-resolves
spatial information for continuous downscaling factors and lead times.
Leveraging weather priors as guidance for the generative process of diffusion
models, we adopt the perspective of conditional probabilities on sampling
super-resolved S2S forecasts. We aim to directly estimate the density
associated with the target S2S forecasts at different spatial resolutions and
lead times without auto-regression or sequence prediction, resulting in an
efficient and flexible model. Synthetic experiments were designed to
super-resolve wind speed S2S forecasts from the European Center for
Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) from a coarse resolution to a finer
resolution of ERA5 reanalysis data, which serves as a high-resolution target.
The innovative aspect of DiffScale lies in its flexibility to downscale
arbitrary scaling factors, enabling it to generalize across various grid
resolutions and lead times -without retraining the model- while correcting
model errors, making it a versatile tool for improving S2S wind speed
forecasts. We achieve a significant improvement in prediction quality,
outperforming baselines up to week 3.

## Bayesian Predictive Coding

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24016v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Predictive coding (PC) is an influential theory of information processing in
the brain, providing a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation.
It is motivated in terms of Bayesian inference, as hidden states and parameters
are optimised via gradient descent on variational free energy. However,
implementations of PC rely on maximum \textit{a posteriori} (MAP) estimates of
hidden states and maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of parameters, limiting
their ability to quantify epistemic uncertainty. In this work, we investigate a
Bayesian extension to PC that estimates a posterior distribution over network
parameters. This approach, termed Bayesian Predictive coding (BPC), preserves
the locality of PC and results in closed-form Hebbian weight updates. Compared
to PC, our BPC algorithm converges in fewer epochs in the full-batch setting
and remains competitive in the mini-batch setting. Additionally, we demonstrate
that BPC offers uncertainty quantification comparable to existing methods in
Bayesian deep learning, while also improving convergence properties. Together,
these results suggest that BPC provides a biologically plausible method for
Bayesian learning in the brain, as well as an attractive approach to
uncertainty quantification in deep learning.

## Artificial Conversations, Real Results: Fostering Language Detection with Synthetic Data

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24062v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Collecting high-quality training data is essential for fine-tuning Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, acquiring such data is often costly and
time-consuming, especially for non-English languages such as Italian. Recently,
researchers have begun to explore the use of LLMs to generate synthetic
datasets as a viable alternative. This study proposes a pipeline for generating
synthetic data and a comprehensive approach for investigating the factors that
influence the validity of synthetic data generated by LLMs by examining how
model performance is affected by metrics such as prompt strategy, text length
and target position in a specific task, i.e. inclusive language detection in
Italian job advertisements. Our results show that, in most cases and across
different metrics, the fine-tuned models trained on synthetic data consistently
outperformed other models on both real and synthetic test datasets. The study
discusses the practical implications and limitations of using synthetic data
for language detection tasks with LLMs.

## Learning a Canonical Basis of Human Preferences from Binary Ratings

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24150v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Recent advances in generative AI have been driven by alignment techniques
such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). RLHF and related
techniques typically involve constructing a dataset of binary or ranked choice
human preferences and subsequently fine-tuning models to align with these
preferences. This paper shifts the focus to understanding the preferences
encoded in such datasets and identifying common human preferences. We find that
a small subset of 21 preference categories (selected from a set of nearly 5,000
distinct preferences) captures >89% of preference variation across individuals.
This small set of preferences is analogous to a canonical basis of human
preferences, similar to established findings that characterize human variation
in psychology or facial recognition studies. Through both synthetic and
empirical evaluations, we confirm that our low-rank, canonical set of human
preferences generalizes across the entire dataset and within specific topics.
We further demonstrate our preference basis' utility in model evaluation, where
our preference categories offer deeper insights into model alignment, and in
model training, where we show that fine-tuning on preference-defined subsets
successfully aligns the model accordingly.

## Spatio-temporal Prediction of Fine-Grained Origin-Destination Matrices with Applications in Ridesharing

**Authors:** Run Yang, Runpeng Dai, Siran Gao, Xiaocheng Tang, Fan Zhou, Hongtu Zhu

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24237v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Accurate spatial-temporal prediction of network-based travelers' requests is
crucial for the effective policy design of ridesharing platforms. Having
knowledge of the total demand between various locations in the upcoming time
slots enables platforms to proactively prepare adequate supplies, thereby
increasing the likelihood of fulfilling travelers' requests and redistributing
idle drivers to areas with high potential demand to optimize the global
supply-demand equilibrium. This paper delves into the prediction of
Origin-Destination (OD) demands at a fine-grained spatial level, especially
when confronted with an expansive set of local regions. While this task holds
immense practical value, it remains relatively unexplored within the research
community. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel prediction model called
OD-CED, which comprises an unsupervised space coarsening technique to alleviate
data sparsity and an encoder-decoder architecture to capture both semantic and
geographic dependencies. Through practical experimentation, OD-CED has
demonstrated remarkable results. It achieved an impressive reduction of up to
45% reduction in root-mean-square error and 60% in weighted mean absolute
percentage error over traditional statistical methods when dealing with OD
matrices exhibiting a sparsity exceeding 90%.

## New Statistical Framework for Extreme Error Probability in High-Stakes Domains for Reliable Machine Learning

**Authors:** Umberto Michelucci, Francesca Venturini

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24262v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Machine learning is vital in high-stakes domains, yet conventional validation
methods rely on averaging metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or mean
absolute error (MAE), which fail to quantify extreme errors. Worst-case
prediction failures can have substantial consequences, but current frameworks
lack statistical foundations for assessing their probability. In this work a
new statistical framework, based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT), is presented
that provides a rigorous approach to estimating worst-case failures. Applying
EVT to synthetic and real-world datasets, this method is shown to enable robust
estimation of catastrophic failure probabilities, overcoming the fundamental
limitations of standard cross-validation. This work establishes EVT as a
fundamental tool for assessing model reliability, ensuring safer AI deployment
in new technologies where uncertainty quantification is central to
decision-making or scientific analysis.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24307v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This study presents a systematic comparison of three approaches for the
analysis of mental health text using large language models (LLMs): prompt
engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. Using LLaMA
3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health
condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest
accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but
requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while
prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate
performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for
implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting
the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment
flexibility.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24354v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Parameter generation has emerged as a novel paradigm for neural network
development, offering an alternative to traditional neural network training by
synthesizing high-quality model weights directly. In the context of Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) for evolving ($\textit{i.e.}$, constantly updated) large
language models (LLMs), this approach promises efficient adaptation without
costly retraining. However, existing methods face critical limitations in
simultaneously achieving scalability and controllability. In this paper, we
introduce $\texttt{ORAL}$, a novel $\textbf{conditional recurrent diffusion}$
framework that addresses these challenges. $\texttt{ORAL}$ incorporates a novel
conditioning mechanism that integrates model architecture and textual task
specifications, enabling the generation of task-specific LoRA parameters that
can seamlessly transfer across evolving foundation models. Our approach
successfully scales to billions-of-parameter LLMs and maintains
controllability. Through extensive experiments across seven language tasks,
four vision tasks, and three multimodal tasks using five pre-trained LLMs, we
demonstrate that $\texttt{ORAL}$ generates high-quality LoRA parameters that
achieve comparable or superior performance to vanilla trained counterparts.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Large real-world robot datasets hold great potential to train generalist
robot models, but scaling real-world human data collection is time-consuming
and resource-intensive. Simulation has great potential in supplementing
large-scale data, especially with recent advances in generative AI and
automated data generation tools that enable scalable creation of robot behavior
datasets. However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it
to the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality
gap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of
simulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown
this strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one
trained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community
lacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes
to reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work
presents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve
vision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from
comprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various
simulation and real-world datasets. Using two domains--a robot arm and a
humanoid--across diverse tasks, we demonstrate that simulation data can enhance
real-world task performance by an average of 38%, even with notable differences
between the simulation and real-world data. Videos and additional results can

## Effectively Controlling Reasoning Models through Thinking Intervention

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24370v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) explicitly generate
intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating final answers, helping the
model excel in complex problem-solving. In this paper, we demonstrate that this
emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained
control over model behavior. We propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm
designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by
strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. We conduct
comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks, including instruction
following on IFEval, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on
XSTest and SORRY-Bench. Our results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention
significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7%
accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in
reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates
for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, our work
opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24376v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Recent advancements in Chain of Thought (COT) generation have significantly
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with
reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as an effective post-training approach.
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but
remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning.
To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding.
It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in
the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and
reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level
hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task
scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable
ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL
with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and
superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks,
even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like
LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual
perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We
identify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual
cues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling,
and RL robustness against noisy signals.

## RIG: Synergizing Reasoning and Imagination in End-to-End Generalist Policy

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24388v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Reasoning before action and imagining potential outcomes (i.e., world models)
are essential for embodied agents operating in complex open-world environments.
Yet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an
end-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent
system, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy.
Thus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination
in an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end
manner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches
the content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from
existing agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation
explicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and
dynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\times$ sample
efficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works.
During inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential
action, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance
to review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.
Experimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not
only improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of
generalist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall
performance.

## Tackling Copyright Issues in AI Image Generation Through Originality Estimation and Genericization

**Authors:** Hiroaki Chiba-Okabe, Weijie J. Su
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.AP, stat.ME, stat.ML
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03341v7
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The rapid progress of generative AI technology has sparked significant
copyright concerns, leading to numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers.
Notably, generative AI's capacity for generating images of copyrighted
characters has been well documented in the literature, and while various
techniques for mitigating copyright issues have been studied, significant risks
remain. Here, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a
generative model to make them more generic and less likely to imitate
distinctive features of copyrighted materials. To achieve this, we introduce a
metric for quantifying the level of originality of data, estimated by drawing
samples from a generative model, and applied in the genericization process. As
a practical implementation, we introduce PREGen (Prompt Rewriting-Enhanced
Genericization), which combines our genericization method with an existing
mitigation technique. Compared to the existing method, PREGen reduces the
likelihood of generating copyrighted characters by more than half when the
names of copyrighted characters are used as the prompt. Additionally, while
generative models can produce copyrighted characters even when their names are
not directly mentioned in the prompt, PREGen almost entirely prevents the
generation of such characters in these cases. Ultimately, this study advances
computational approaches for quantifying and strengthening copyright
protection, thereby providing practical methodologies to promote responsible
generative AI development.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23982v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters.
Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network
outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random
initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to
consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of
the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced
by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the
limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an
exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given
energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps
between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random
MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But
we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation
functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We
find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some
non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of
random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and
ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24009v1

**Abstract:**
Learning physics simulations from video data requires maintaining spatial and
temporal consistency, a challenge often addressed with strong inductive biases
or ground-truth 3D information -- limiting scalability and generalization. We
introduce 3DGSim, a 3D physics simulator that learns object dynamics end-to-end
from multi-view RGB videos. It encodes images into a 3D Gaussian particle
representation, propagates dynamics via a transformer, and renders frames using
3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly training inverse rendering with a dynamics
transformer using a temporal encoding and merging layer, 3DGSimembeds physical
properties into point-wise latent vectors without enforcing explicit
connectivity constraints. This enables the model to capture diverse physical
behaviors, from rigid to elastic and cloth-like interactions, along with
realistic lighting effects that also generalize to unseen multi-body
interactions and novel scene edits.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24219v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We propose a unified framework that integrates object detection (OD) and
visual grounding (VG) for remote sensing (RS) imagery. To support conventional
OD and establish an intuitive prior for VG task, we fine-tune an open-set
object detector using referring expression data, framing it as a partially
supervised OD task. In the first stage, we construct a graph representation of
each image, comprising object queries, class embeddings, and proposal
locations. Then, our task-aware architecture processes this graph to perform
the VG task. The model consists of: (i) a multi-branch network that integrates
spatial, visual, and categorical features to generate task-aware proposals, and
(ii) an object reasoning network that assigns probabilities across proposals,
followed by a soft selection mechanism for final referring object localization.
Our model demonstrates superior performance on the OPT-RSVG and DIOR-RSVG
datasets, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while retaining classical OD capabilities. The code will be available in our
repository: \url{https://github.com/rd20karim/MB-ORES}.

**Abstract:**
We introduce UniOcc, a comprehensive, unified benchmark for occupancy
forecasting (i.e., predicting future occupancies based on historical
information) and current-frame occupancy prediction from camera images. UniOcc
unifies data from multiple real-world datasets (i.e., nuScenes, Waymo) and
high-fidelity driving simulators (i.e., CARLA, OpenCOOD), which provides 2D/3D
occupancy labels with per-voxel flow annotations and support for cooperative
autonomous driving. In terms of evaluation, unlike existing studies that rely
on suboptimal pseudo labels for evaluation, UniOcc incorporates novel metrics
that do not depend on ground-truth occupancy, enabling robust assessment of
additional aspects of occupancy quality. Through extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate that large-scale, diverse training data
and explicit flow information significantly enhance occupancy prediction and
forecasting performance.

**Abstract:**
In this paper, prediction of airfoil shape from targeted pressure
distribution (suction and pressure sides) and vice versa is demonstrated using
both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
techniques. The dataset is generated for 1600 airfoil shapes, with simulations
carried out at Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 10,000 and 90,00,000 and
angles of attack (AoA) ranging from 0 to 15 degrees, ensuring the dataset
captured diverse aerodynamic conditions. Five different CNN and DNN models are
developed depending on the input/output parameters. Results demonstrate that
the refined models exhibit improved efficiency, with the DNN model achieving a
multi-fold reduction in training time compared to the CNN model for complex
datasets consisting of varying airfoil, Re, and AoA. The predicted airfoil
shapes/pressure distribution closely match the targeted values, validating the
effectiveness of deep learning frameworks. However, the performance of CNN
models is found to be better compared to DNN models. Lastly, a flying wing
aircraft model of wingspan >10 m is considered for the prediction of pressure
distribution along the chordwise. The proposed CNN and DNN models show
promising results. This research underscores the potential of deep learning
models accelerating aerodynamic optimization and advancing the design of
high-performance airfoils.

## Optimization Methods Rooting in Optimal Control

**Authors:** Huanshui Zhang, Hongxia Wang

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01334v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In the paper, we propose solving optimization problems (OPs) and
understanding the Newton method from the optimal control view. We propose a new
optimization algorithm based on the optimal control problem (OCP). The
algorithm features converging more rapidly than gradient descent, meanwhile, it
is superior to Newton's method because it is not divergent in general and can
be applied in the case of a singular Hessian matrix. These merits are supported
by the convergence analysis for the algorithm in the paper. We also point out
that the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is inversely proportional
to the magnitude of the control weight matrix and proportional to the control
terminal time inherited from OCP.

## Superlinear Optimization Algorithms

**Abstract:**
This paper proposes several novel optimization algorithms for minimizing a
nonlinear objective function. The algorithms are enlightened by the optimal
state trajectory of an optimal control problem closely related to the minimized
objective function. They are superlinear convergent when appropriate parameters
are selected as required. Unlike Newton's method, all of them can be also
applied in the case of a singular Hessian matrix. More importantly, by
reduction, some of them avoid calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix or
an identical dimension matrix and some of them need only the diagonal elements
of the Hessian matrix. In these cases, these algorithms still outperform the
gradient descent method. The merits of the proposed optimization algorithm are
illustrated by numerical experiments.

## ADMM for Nonconvex Optimization under Minimal Continuity Assumption

**Authors:** Ganzhao Yuan
**Categories:** math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03233v4
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a novel approach to solving multi-block nonconvex
composite optimization problems through a proximal linearized Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This method incorporates an Increasing
Penalization and Decreasing Smoothing (IPDS) strategy. Distinguishing itself
from existing ADMM-style algorithms, our approach (denoted IPDS-ADMM) imposes a
less stringent condition, specifically requiring continuity in just one block
of the objective function. IPDS-ADMM requires that the penalty increases and
the smoothing parameter decreases, both at a controlled pace. When the
associated linear operator is bijective, IPDS-ADMM uses an over-relaxation
stepsize for faster convergence; however, when the linear operator is
surjective, IPDS-ADMM uses an under-relaxation stepsize for global convergence.
We devise a novel potential function to facilitate our convergence analysis and
prove an oracle complexity $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to achieve an
$\epsilon$-approximate critical point. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first complexity result for using ADMM to solve this class of nonsmooth
nonconvex problems. Finally, some experiments on the sparse PCA problem are
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

## Revisiting Lossless Convexification: Theoretical Guarantees for Discrete-time Optimal Control Problems

**Authors:** Dayou Luo, Kazuya Echigo, Behçet Açıkmeşe

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09748v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Lossless Convexification (LCvx) is a modeling approach that transforms a
class of nonconvex optimal control problems, where nonconvexity primarily
arises from control constraints, into convex problems through convex
relaxations. These convex problems can be solved using polynomial-time
numerical methods after discretization, which converts the original
infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. However, existing
LCvx theory is limited to continuous-time optimal control problems, as the
equivalence between the relaxed convex problem and the original nonconvex
problem holds only in continuous time. This paper extends LCvx to discrete-time
optimal control problems by classifying them into normal and long-horizon
cases. For normal cases, after an arbitrarily small perturbation to the system
dynamics (recursive equality constraints), applying the existing LCvx method to
discrete-time problems results in optimal controls that meet the original
nonconvex constraints at all but no more than $n_x - 1$ temporal grid points,
where $n_x$ is the state dimension. For long-horizon cases, the existing LCvx
method fails, but we resolve this issue by integrating it with a bisection
search, leveraging the continuity of the value function from the relaxed convex
problem to achieve similar results as in normal cases. This paper improves the
theoretical foundation of LCvx, expanding its applicability to real-world
discrete-time optimal control problems.

## Optimal Control of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01484v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This paper focuses on optimal control problem for a class of discrete-time
nonlinear systems. In practical applications, computation time is a crucial
consideration when solving nonlinear optimal control problems, especially under
real-time constraints. While linearization methods are computationally
efficient, their inherent low accuracy can compromise control precision and
overall performance. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel
approach based on the optimal control method. Firstly, the original optimal
control problem is transformed into an equivalent optimization problem, which
is resolved using the Pontryagin's maximum principle, and a superlinear
convergence algorithm is presented. Furthermore, to improve computation
efficiency, explicit formulas for computing both the gradient and hessian
matrix of the cost function are proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm is validated through simulations and experiments on a linear
quadratic regulator problem and an automatic guided vehicle trajectory tracking
problem, demonstrating its ability for real-time online precise control.

## Distributed Optimization Method Based On Optimal Control

**Authors:** Ziyuan Guo, Yue Sun, Yeming Xu, Liping Zhang, Huanshui Zhang

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10658v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this paper, a novel distributed optimization framework has been proposed.
The key idea is to convert optimization problems into optimal control problems
where the objective of each agent is to design the current control input
minimizing the original objective function of itself and updated size for the
future time instant. Compared with the existing distributed optimization
problem for optimizing a sum of convex objective functions corresponding to
multiple agents, we present a distributed optimization algorithm for
multi-agents system based on the results from the maximum principle. Moreover,
the convergence and superlinear convergence rate are also analyzed stringently.

## Diffusion at Absolute Zero: Langevin Sampling using Successive Moreau Envelopes

**Categories:** math.OC, 65C40, 65C05, 68U10, 65C60, G.3; G.1.6
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22258v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We propose a method for sampling from Gibbs distributions of the form
$\pi(x)\propto\exp(-U(x))$ by considering a family $(\pi^{t})_t$ of
approximations of the target density which is such that $\pi^{t}$ exhibits
favorable properties for sampling when $t$ is large, and $\pi^{t} \to \pi$ as
$t \to 0$. This sequence is obtained by replacing (parts of) the potential $U$
by its Moreau envelope. Through the sequential sampling from $\pi^{t}$ for
decreasing values of $t$ by a Langevin algorithm with appropriate step size,
the samples are guided from a simple starting density to the more complex
target quickly. We prove the ergodicity of the method as well as its
convergence to the target density without assuming convexity or
differentiability of the potential $U$. In addition to the theoretical
analysis, we show experimental results that support the superiority of the
method in terms of convergence speed and mode-coverage of multi-modal densities
to current algorithms. The experiments range from one-dimensional toy-problems
to high-dimensional inverse imaging problems with learned potentials.

## A Decomposition Approach for the Gain Function in the Feedback Particle Filter

**Authors:** Ruoyu Wang, Huimin Miao, Xue Luo
**Categories:** math.OC, 93-08, 93E11
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23662v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The feedback particle filter (FPF) is an innovative, control-oriented and
resampling-free adaptation of the traditional particle filter (PF). In the FPF,
individual particles are regulated via a feedback gain, and the corresponding
gain function serves as the solution to the Poisson's equation equipped with a
probability-weighted Laplacian. Owing to the fact that closed-form expressions
can only be computed under specific circumstances, approximate solutions are
typically indispensable. This paper is centered around the development of a
novel algorithm for approximating the gain function in the FPF. The fundamental
concept lies in decomposing the Poisson's equation into two equations that can
be precisely solved, provided that the observation function is a polynomial. A
free parameter is astutely incorporated to guarantee exact solvability. The
computational complexity of the proposed decomposition method shows a linear
correlation with the number of particles and the polynomial degree of the
observation function. We perform comprehensive numerical comparisons between
our method, the PF, and the FPF using the constant-gain approximation and the
kernel-based approach. Our decomposition method outperforms the PF and the FPF
with constant-gain approximation in terms of accuracy. Additionally, it has the
shortest CPU time among all the compared methods with comparable performance.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This paper proposes a novel replenishment strategy that can jointly support
multiple satellite constellations. In this approach, multiple constellations
share launch opportunities and parking orbits to address the operational
satellite failures and ensure the desired service level of the constellations.
We develop an inventory management model based on parametric replenishment
policies, considering the launch vehicle's capacity and the shipping size of
satellites. Based on this model, we introduce two decision-making scenarios and
propose their corresponding solution frameworks. We conduct two case studies to
provide valuable insights into the proposed strategy and demonstrate its
applicability to supply chain management for maintaining multiple satellite
constellations.

## Shannon-and Von Neumann-entropy regularizations of linear and semidefinite programs

**Authors:** Saroj Prasad Chhatoi, Jean B Lasserre
**Categories:** math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23815v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We consider the LP in standard form min {c T x : Ax = b; x $\ge$ 0} and
inspired by $\epsilon$-regularization in Optimal Transport, we introduce its
$\epsilon$-regularization ''min {c T x + $\epsilon$ f (x) : Ax = b; x $\ge$
0}'' via the (convex) Boltzmann-Shannon entropy f (x) := i x i ln x i . We also
provide a similar regularization for the semidefinite program ''min {Tr(C
$\bullet$ X) : A(X) = b; X 0}'' but with now the so-called Von Neumann entropy,
as in Quantum Optimal Transport. Importantly, both are not barriers of the LP
and SDP cones respectively. We show that this problem admits an equivalent
unconstrained convex problem max $\lambda$$\in$R m G$\epsilon$($\lambda$) for
an explicit concave differentiable function G$\epsilon$ in dual variables
$\lambda$ $\in$ R m . As $\epsilon$ goes to zero, its optimal value converges
to the optimal value of the initial LP. While it resembles the log-barrier
formulation of interior point algorithm for the initial LP, it has a
distinguishing advantage. Namely for fixed $\lambda$, G$\epsilon$($\lambda$) is
obtained as a minimization over the whole space x $\in$ R d (and not over x
$\ge$ 0) to still obtain a nonnegative solution x($\lambda$) $\ge$ 0, whence an
explicit form of G$\epsilon$ very useful for its unconstrained maximization
over R m.

## Sampled-data and event-triggered control of globally Lipschitz infinite-dimensional systems

**Categories:** math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23884v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We show that if a linear infinite-dimensional system is exponentially
stabilizable by compact feedback, it is also stabilizable by means of a
sampled-data feedback that is fed through a globally Lipschitz nonlinearity,
provided that the sector bound for the nonlinearity and the sampling time is
small enough. Next we develop a switching-based event-triggered control scheme
stabilizing the system with a reduced number of switching events. We
demonstrate our results on an example of finite-dimensional stabilization of a
Sturm-Liouville parabolic system.

## Bi-Level Route Optimization and Path Planning with Hazard Exploration

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24044v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Effective risk monitoring in dynamic environments such as disaster zones
requires an adaptive exploration strategy to detect hidden threats. We propose
a bi-level unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitoring strategy that efficiently
integrates high-level route optimization with low-level path planning for known
and unknown hazards. At the high level, we formulate the route optimization as
a vehicle routing problem (VRP) to determine the optimal sequence for visiting
known hazard locations. To strategically incorporate exploration efficiency, we
introduce an edge-based centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT), which refines
baseline routes using pseudo-nodes and allocates path budgets based on the
UAV's battery capacity using a line segment Voronoi diagram. At the low level,
path planning maximizes information gain within the allocated path budget by
generating kinematically feasible B-spline trajectories. Bayesian inference is
applied to dynamically update hazard probabilities, enabling the UAVs to
prioritize unexplored regions. Simulation results demonstrate that edge-based
CVT improves spatial coverage and route uniformity compared to the node-based
method. Additionally, our optimized path planning consistently outperforms
baselines in hazard discovery rates across a diverse set of scenarios.

## The Influence of an Adjoint Mismatch on the Primal-Dual Douglas-Rachford Method

**Authors:** Emanuele Naldi, Felix Schneppe

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24141v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The primal-dual Douglas-Rachford method is a well-known algorithm to solve
optimization problems written as convex-concave saddle-point problems. Each
iteration involves solving a linear system involving a linear operator and its
adjoint. However, in practical applications it is often computationally
favorable to replace the adjoint operator by a computationally more efficient
approximation. This leads to an adjoint mismatch. In this paper, we analyze the
convergence of the primal-dual Douglas-Rachford method under the presence of an
adjoint mismatch. We provide mild conditions that guarantee the existence of a
fixed point and find an upper bound on the error of the primal solution.
Furthermore, we establish step sizes in the strongly convex setting that
guarantee linear convergence under mild conditions. Additionally, we provide an
alternative method that can also be derived from the Douglas-Rachford method
and is also guaranteed to converge in this setting. Moreover, we illustrate our
results both for an academic and a real-world inspired example.

## Convexity of chance constraints for elliptical and skewed distributions with copula structures dependent on decision variables

**Categories:** math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24153v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Chance constraints describe a set of given random inequalities depending on
the decision vector satisfied with a large enough probability. They are widely
used in decision making under uncertain data in many engineering problems. This
paper aims to derive the convexity of chance constraints with row dependent
elliptical and skewed random variables via a copula depending on decision
vectors. We obtain best thresholds of the $r$-concavity for any real number $r$
and improve probability thresholds of the eventual convexity. We prove the
eventual convexity with elliptical distributions and a Gumbel-Hougaard copula
despite the copula's singularity near the origin. We determine the
$\alpha$-decreasing densities of generalized hyperbolic distributions by
estimating the modified Bessel functions. By applying the $\alpha$-decreasing
property and a radial decomposition, we achieve the eventual convexity for
three types of skewed distributions. Finally, we provide an example to
illustrate the eventual convexity of a feasible set containing the origin.

## Linear Reweighted Regularization Algorithms for Graph Matching Problem

**Categories:** math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24329v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The graph matching problem is a significant special case of the Quadratic
Assignment Problem, with extensive applications in pattern recognition,
computer vision, protein alignments and related fields. As the problem is
NP-hard, relaxation and regularization techniques are frequently employed to
improve tractability. However, most existing regularization terms are
nonconvex, posing optimization challenges. In this paper, we propose a linear
reweighted regularizer framework for solving the relaxed graph matching
problem, preserving the convexity of the formulation. By solving a sequence of
relaxed problems with the linear reweighted regularization term, one can obtain
a sparse solution that, under certain conditions, theoretically aligns with the
original graph matching problem's solution. Furthermore, we present a practical
version of the algorithm by incorporating the projected gradient method. The
proposed framework is applied to synthetic instances, demonstrating promising
numerical results.

**Abstract:**
The international collaboration designing and constructing the Deep
Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility
(LBNF) has developed a two-phase strategy toward the implementation of this
leading-edge, large-scale science project. The ambitious physics program of
Phase I and Phase II of DUNE is dependent upon deployment and utilization of
significant computing resources, and successful research and development of
software (both infrastructure and algorithmic) in order to achieve these
scientific goals. This submission discusses the computing resources
projections, infrastructure support, and software development needed for DUNE
during the coming decades as an input to the European Strategy for Particle
Physics Update for 2026. The DUNE collaboration is submitting four main
contributions to the 2026 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics
process. This submission to the 'Computing' stream focuses on DUNE software and
computing. Additional inputs related to the DUNE science program, DUNE detector
technologies and R&D, and European contributions to Fermilab accelerator
upgrades and facilities for the DUNE experiment, are also being submitted to
other streams.

## Asymmetry in Distributions of Accumulated Gains and Losses in Stock Returns

**Authors:** Hamed Farahani, R. A. Serota
**Categories:** q-fin.ST, econ.TH, physics.data-an
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24241v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We study decades-long historic distributions of accumulated S\&P500 returns,
from daily returns to those over several weeks. The time series of the returns
emphasize major upheavals in the markets -- Black Monday, Tech Bubble,
Financial Crisis and Covid Pandemic -- which are reflected in the tail ends of
the distributions. De-trending the overall gain, we concentrate on comparing
distributions of gains and losses. Specifically, we compare the tails of the
distributions, which are believed to exhibit power-law behavior and possibly
contain outliers. Towards this end we find confidence intervals of the linear
fits of the tails of the complementary cumulative distribution functions on a
log-log scale, as well as conduct a statistical U-test in order to detect
outliers. We also study probability density functions of the full distributions
of the returns with the emphasis on their asymmetry. The key empirical
observations are that the mean of de-trended distributions increases
near-linearly with the number of days of accumulation while the overall skew is
negative -- consistent with the heavier tails of losses -- and depends little
on the number of days of accumulation. At the same time the variance of the
distributions exhibits near-perfect linear dependence on the number of days of
accumulation, that is it remains constant if scaled to the latter. Finally, we
discuss the theoretical framework for understanding accumulated returns. Our
main conclusion is that the current state of theory, which predicts symmetric
or near-symmetric distributions of returns cannot explain the aggregate of
empirical results.

## Trilinear coupling and toroidicity in multiferroics

**Authors:** Andrea Urru, Alessio Filippetti, Jorge Íñiguez-Gonzàlez, Vincenzo Fiorentini
**Categories:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.comp-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11939v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Magnetoelectric responses are related in general to magnetic multipoles, and
in particular the off-diagonal linear response is proportional to the
toroidization order parameter. In multiferroics with three order parameters
(polarization, magnetization, and toroidization), such response turns out to be
also proportional to the trilinear coupling between the order parameters. Here
we explore this scenario, discussing the effects of such trilinear coupling
within a Landau theory framework, and using ab initio calculations to discuss a
specific model system for this effect, namely the recently predicted
three-order-parameter multiferroic metal Bi$_5$Mn$_5$O$_{17}$.

**Categories:** physics.comp-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23657v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces JAX-BTE, a GPU-accelerated, differentiable solver for
the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) based on differentiable
programming. JAX-BTE enables accurate, efficient and differentiable multiscale
thermal modeling by leveraging high-performance GPU computing and automatic
differentiation. The solver efficiently addresses the high-dimensional and
complex integro-differential nature of the phonon BTE, facilitating both
forward simulations and data-augmented inverse simulations through end-to-end
optimization. Validation is performed across a range of 1D to 3D simulations,
including complex FinFET structures, in both forward and inverse settings,
demonstrating excellent performance and reliability. JAX-BTE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art BTE solvers in forward simulations and uniquely
enables inverse simulations, making it a powerful tool for multiscale thermal
analysis and design for semiconductor devices.

## Performing Path Integral Molecular Dynamics Using Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Molecular Simulation Framework

**Authors:** Cheng Fan, Maodong Li, Sihao Yuan, Zhaoxin Xie, Dechin Chen, Yi Isaac Yang, Yi Qin Gao
**Categories:** physics.chem-ph, physics.comp-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23728v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This study employed an artificial intelligence-enhanced molecular simulation
framework to enable efficient Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD)
simulations. Owing to its modular architecture and high-throughput
capabilities, the framework effectively mitigates the computational complexity
and resource-intensive limitations associated with conventional PIMD
approaches. By integrating machine learning force fields (MLFFs) into the
framework, we rigorously tested its performance through two representative
cases: a small-molecule reaction system (double proton transfer in formic acid
dimer) and a bulk-phase transition system (water-ice phase transformation).
Computational results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves
accelerated PIMD simulations while preserving quantum mechanical accuracy.
These findings show that nuclear quantum effects can be captured for complex
molecular systems, using relatively low computational cost.

## Agent-Centric Personalized Multiple Clustering with Multi-Modal LLMs

**Authors:** Ziye Chen, Yiqun Duan, Riheng Zhu, Zhenbang Sun, Mingming Gong
**Categories:** cs.AI, 68T07, 68T05, 05C82
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22241v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Personalized multiple clustering aims to generate diverse partitions of a
dataset based on different user-specific aspects, rather than a single
clustering. It has recently drawn research interest for accommodating varying
user preferences. Recent approaches primarily use CLIP embeddings with proxy
learning to extract representations biased toward user clustering preferences.
However, CLIP primarily focuses on coarse image-text alignment, lacking a deep
contextual understanding of user interests. To overcome these limitations, we
propose an agent-centric personalized clustering framework that leverages
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as agents to comprehensively traverse
a relational graph to search for clusters based on user interests. Due to the
advanced reasoning mechanism of MLLMs, the obtained clusters align more closely
with user-defined criteria than those obtained from CLIP-based representations.
To reduce computational overhead, we shorten the agents' traversal path by
constructing a relational graph using user-interest-biased embeddings extracted
by MLLMs. A large number of weakly connected edges can be filtered out based on
embedding similarity, facilitating an efficient traversal search for agents.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves NMI scores of
0.9667 and 0.9481 on the Card Order and Card Suits benchmarks, respectively,
largely improving the SOTA model by over 140%.

## Intrinsically-Motivated Humans and Agents in Open-World Exploration

**Authors:** Aly Lidayan, Yuqing Du, Eliza Kosoy, Maria Rufova, Pieter Abbeel, Alison Gopnik
**Categories:** cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23631v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
What drives exploration? Understanding intrinsic motivation is a
long-standing challenge in both cognitive science and artificial intelligence;
numerous objectives have been proposed and used to train agents, yet there
remains a gap between human and agent exploration. We directly compare adults,
children, and AI agents in a complex open-ended environment, Crafter, and study
how common intrinsic objectives: Entropy, Information Gain, and Empowerment,
relate to their behavior. We find that only Entropy and Empowerment are
consistently positively correlated with human exploration progress, indicating
that these objectives may better inform intrinsic reward design for agents.
Furthermore, across agents and humans we observe that Entropy initially
increases rapidly, then plateaus, while Empowerment increases continuously,
suggesting that state diversity may provide more signal in early exploration,
while advanced exploration should prioritize control. Finally, we find
preliminary evidence that private speech utterances, and particularly goal
verbalizations, may aid exploration in children.

## MolGround: A Benchmark for Molecular Grounding

**Authors:** Jiaxin Wu, Ting Zhang, Rubing Chen, Wengyu Zhang, Chen Jason Zhang, Xiaoyong Wei, Li Qing
**Categories:** cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23668v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Current molecular understanding approaches predominantly focus on the
descriptive aspect of human perception, providing broad, topic-level insights.
However, the referential aspect -- linking molecular concepts to specific
structural components -- remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we
propose a molecular grounding benchmark designed to evaluate a model's
referential abilities. We align molecular grounding with established
conventions in NLP, cheminformatics, and molecular science, showcasing the
potential of NLP techniques to advance molecular understanding within the AI
for Science movement. Furthermore, we constructed the largest molecular
understanding benchmark to date, comprising 79k QA pairs, and developed a
multi-agent grounding prototype as proof of concept. This system outperforms
existing models, including GPT-4o, and its grounding outputs have been
integrated to enhance traditional tasks such as molecular captioning and ATC
(Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical) classification.

## DebFlow: Automating Agent Creation via Agent Debate

**Authors:** Jinwei Su, Yinghui Xia, Ronghua Shi, Jianhui Wang, Jianuo Huang, Yijin Wang, Tianyu Shi, Yang Jingsong, Lewei He
**Categories:** cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23781v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential and
impressive performance in automating the generation and optimization of
workflows. However, existing approaches are marked by limited reasoning
capabilities, high computational demands, and significant resource
requirements. To address these issues, we propose DebFlow, a framework that
employs a debate mechanism to optimize workflows and integrates reflexion to
improve based on previous experiences. We evaluated our method across six
benchmark datasets, including HotpotQA, MATH, and ALFWorld. Our approach
achieved a 3\% average performance improvement over the latest baselines,
demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse problem domains. In particular,
during training, our framework reduces resource consumption by 37\% compared to
the state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we performed ablation studies.
Removing the Debate component resulted in a 4\% performance drop across two
benchmark datasets, significantly greater than the 2\% drop observed when the
Reflection component was removed. These findings strongly demonstrate the
critical role of Debate in enhancing framework performance, while also
highlighting the auxiliary contribution of reflexion to overall optimization.

## What the F*ck Is Artificial General Intelligence?

**Authors:** Michael Timothy Bennett
**Categories:** cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23923v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is an established field of research.
Yet Melanie Mitchell and others have questioned if the term still has meaning.
AGI has been subject to so much hype and speculation it has become something of
a Rorschach test. Mitchell points out that the debate will only be settled
through long term, scientific investigation. To that end here is a short,
accessible and provocative overview of AGI. I compare definitions of
intelligence, settling on intelligence in terms of adaptation and AGI as an
artificial scientist. Taking my queue from Sutton's Bitter Lesson I describe
two foundational tools used to build adaptive systems: search and
approximation. I compare pros, cons, hybrids and architectures like o3,
AlphaGo, AERA, NARS and Hyperon. I then discuss overall meta-approaches to
making systems behave more intelligently. I divide them into scale-maxing,
simp-maxing, w-maxing based on the Bitter Lesson, Ockham's and Bennett's
Razors. These maximise resources, simplicity of form, and the weakness of
constraints on functionality. I discuss examples including AIXI, the free
energy principle and The Embiggening of language models. I conclude that though
scale-maxed approximation dominates, AGI will be a fusion of tools and
meta-approaches. The Embiggening was enabled by improvements in hardware. Now
the bottlenecks are sample and energy efficiency.

**Abstract:**
As AI technology advances, it is driving innovation across industries,
increasing the demand for scalable AI project deployment. However, deployment
remains a critical challenge due to complex environment configurations,
dependency conflicts, cross-platform adaptation, and debugging difficulties,
which hinder automation and adoption. This paper introduces AI2Agent, an
end-to-end framework that automates AI project deployment through
guideline-driven execution, self-adaptive debugging, and case \& solution
accumulation. AI2Agent dynamically analyzes deployment challenges, learns from
past cases, and iteratively refines its approach, significantly reducing human
intervention. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted experiments on 30 AI
deployment cases, covering TTS, text-to-image generation, image editing, and
other AI applications. Results show that AI2Agent significantly reduces
deployment time and improves success rates. The code and demo video are now
publicly accessible.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Instruction tuning has emerged as a paramount method for tailoring the
behaviors of LLMs. Recent work has unveiled the potential for LLMs to achieve
high performance through fine-tuning with a limited quantity of high-quality
instruction data. Building upon this approach, we further explore the impact of
prompt's robustness on the selection of high-quality instruction data. This
paper proposes a pioneering framework of high-quality online instruction data
mining for instruction tuning, focusing on the impact of prompt's robustness on
the data mining process. Our notable innovation, is to generate the adversarial
instruction data by conducting the attack for the prompt of online instruction
data. Then, we introduce an Adversarial Instruction-Following Difficulty metric
to measure how much help the adversarial instruction data can provide to the
generation of the corresponding response. Apart from it, we propose a novel
Adversarial Instruction Output Embedding Consistency approach to select
high-quality online instruction data. We conduct extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets to assess the performance. The experimental results serve to
underscore the effectiveness of our proposed two methods. Moreover, the results
underscore the critical practical significance of considering prompt's
robustness.

## ACPBench Hard: Unrestrained Reasoning about Action, Change, and Planning

**Authors:** Harsha Kokel, Michael Katz, Kavitha Srinivas, Shirin Sohrabi
**Categories:** cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24378v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The ACPBench dataset provides atomic reasoning tasks required for efficient
planning. The dataset is aimed at distilling the complex plan generation task
into separate atomic reasoning tasks in their easiest possible form, boolean or
multiple-choice questions, where the model has to choose the right answer from
the provided options. While the aim of ACPBench is to test the simplest form of
reasoning about action and change, when tasked with planning, a model does not
typically have options to choose from and thus the reasoning required for
planning dictates an open-ended, generative form for these tasks. To that end,
we introduce ACPBench Hard, a generative version of ACPBench, with open-ended
questions which the model needs to answer. Models that perform well on these
tasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a
policy. We discuss the complexity of these tasks as well as the complexity of
validating the correctness of their answers and present validation algorithms
for each task. Equipped with these validators, we test the performance of a
variety of models on our tasks and find that for most of these tasks the
performance of even the largest models is still subpar. Our experiments show
that no model outperforms another in these tasks and with a few exceptions all
tested language models score below 65%, indicating that even the current
frontier language models have a long way to go before they can reliably reason
about planning. In fact, even the so-called reasoning models struggle with
solving these reasoning tasks. ACPBench Hard collection is available at the

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05069v2

**Abstract:**
We study a class of discrete models in which a collection of particles
evolves in time following the gradient flow of an energy depending on the cell
areas of an associated Laguerre (i.e. a weighted Voronoi) tessellation. We
consider the high number of cell limit of such systems and, using a modulated
energy argument, we prove convergence towards smooth solutions of nonlinear
diffusion PDEs of porous medium type.

## Numerical Unique Ergodicity of Monotone SDEs driven by Nondegenerate Multiplicative Noise

**Authors:** Zhihui Liu, Zhizhou Liu
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.NA, Primary 60H35, 60H15, 65M60
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01112v5
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We first establish the unique ergodicity of the stochastic theta method (STM)
with $\theta \in [1/2, 1]$ for monotone SODEs, without growth restriction on
the coefficients, driven by nondegenerate multiplicative noise. The main
ingredient of the arguments lies in constructing new Lyapunov functions
involving the coefficients, the stepsize, and $\theta$ and deriving a
minorization condition for the STM. We then generalize the arguments to the
Galerkin-based full discretizations for a class of monotone SPDEs driven by
infinite-dimensional nondegenerate multiplicative trace-class noise. Applying
these results to the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation indicates that its
Galerkin-based full discretizations are uniquely ergodic for any interface
thickness. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical results.

## A polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method solving three-dimensional heat conduction problems

**Authors:** Mingjiao Yan, Yang Yang, Chao Su, Zongliang Zhang, Qingsong Duan, Dengmiao Hao, Jian Zhou
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.NA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15331v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this study, we derived a three-dimensional scaled boundary finite element
formulation for heat conduction problems. By incorporating Wachspress shape
functions, a polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method (PSBFEM) was
proposed to address heat conduction challenges in complex geometries. To
address the complexity of traditional methods, this work introduced polygonal
discretization techniques that simplified the topological structure of the
polyhedral mesh and effectively integrated polyhedral and octree meshes,
thereby reducing the number of element faces and enhancing mesh efficiency to
accommodate intricate shapes. The developed formulation supported both
steady-state and transient heat conduction analyses and was implemented in
ABAQUS through a user-defined element (UEL). Through a series of numerical
examples, the accuracy and convergence of the proposed method were validated.
The results indicated that the PSBFEM consistently achieved higher accuracy
than the FEM as the mesh was refined. The polyhedral elements offered a
computationally efficient solution for complex simulations, significantly
reducing computational costs.Additionally, by utilizing the octree mesh parent
element acceleration technique, the computational efficiency of PSBFEM
surpassed that of the FEM.

## Quasi-Monte Carlo for partial differential equations with generalized Gaussian input uncertainty

**Categories:** math.NA, cs.NA, 65D30, 65D32, 35R60
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03793v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
There has been a surge of interest in uncertainty quantification for
parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) with Gevrey regular inputs.
The Gevrey class contains functions that are infinitely smooth with a growth
condition on the higher-order partial derivatives, but which are nonetheless
not analytic in general. Recent studies by Chernov and Le (Comput. Math. Appl.,
2024, and SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2024) as well as Harbrecht, Schmidlin, and
Schwab (Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 2024) analyze the setting wherein the
input random field is assumed to be uniformly bounded with respect to the
uncertain parameters. In this paper, we relax this assumption and allow for
parameter-dependent bounds. The parametric inputs are modeled as generalized
Gaussian random variables, and we analyze the application of quasi-Monte Carlo
(QMC) integration to assess the PDE response statistics using randomly shifted
rank-1 lattice rules. In addition to the QMC error analysis, we also consider
the dimension truncation and finite element errors in this setting.

## Fully spectral scheme for the linear BGK equation on the whole space

**Authors:** Bastien Grosse
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.NA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14396v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this article, we design a fully spectral method in both space and velocity
for a linear inhomogeneous kinetic equation with mass, momentum and energy
conservation. We focus on the linear BGK equation with a confinement potential
$\phi$, even if the method could be applied to different collision operators.
It is based upon the projection on Hermite polynomials in velocity and
orthonormal polynomials with respect to the weight $e^{-\phi}$ in space. The
potential $\phi$ is assumed to be a polynomial. It is, to the author's
knowledge, the first scheme which preserves hypocoercive behavior in addition
to the conservation laws. These different properties are illustrated
numerically on both quadratic and double well potential.

## Bayesian Inference for a Time-Fractional HIV Model with Nonlinear Diffusion

**Authors:** Mohamed BenSalah, Salih Tatar, Suleyman Ulusoy
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.NA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23638v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This study investigates an inverse problem associated with a time-fractional
HIV infection model incorporating nonlinear diffusion. The model describes the
dynamics of uninfected target cells, infected cells, and free virus particles,
where the diffusion terms are nonlinear density functions. The primary
objective is to recover the unknown diffusion functions by utilizing final-time
measurement data. Due to the inherent ill-posedness of the inverse problem and
the presence of measurement noise, we employ a Bayesian inference framework to
obtain stable and reliable estimates while quantifying uncertainty. To solve
the inverse problem efficiently, we develop an Iterative Regularizing Ensemble
Kalman Method (IREKM), which enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple
diffusion terms without requiring gradient information. Numerical experiments
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reconstructing the unknown
diffusion terms under different noise levels, demonstrating its robustness and
accuracy. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of HIV infection
dynamics and provide a computational approach for parameter estimation in
fractional diffusion models.

## Convergence of Calderón residuals

**Authors:** Ralf Hiptmair, Carolina Urzúa-Torres, Anouk Wisse
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.NA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23900v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this paper, we describe a framework to compute expected convergence rates
for residuals based on the Calder\'on identities for general second order
differential operators for which fundamental solutions are known. The idea is
that these rates could be used to validate implementations of boundary integral
operators and allow to test operators separately by choosing solutions where
parts of the Calder\'on identities vanish. Our estimates rely on simple vector
norms, and thus avoid the use of hard-to-compute norms and the residual
computation can be easily implemented in existing boundary element codes. We
test the proposed Calder\'on residuals as debugging tool by introducing
artificial errors into the Galerkin matrices of some of the boundary integral
operators for the Laplacian and time-harmonic Maxwell's equations. From this,
we learn that our estimates are not sharp enough to always detect errors, but
still provide a simple and useful debugging tool in many situations.

## A simple and general framework for the construction of exactly div-curl-grad compatible discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes on unstructured simplex meshes

**Authors:** R. Abgrall, M. Dumbser, P. H. Maire
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.NA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24131v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We introduce a new family of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element
schemes for the discretization of first order systems of hyperbolic partial
differential equations (PDE) on unstructured simplex meshes in two and three
space dimensions that respect the two basic vector calculus identities exactly
also at the discrete level, namely that the curl of the gradient is zero and
that the divergence of the curl is zero. The key ingredient here is the
construction of two compatible discrete nabla operators, a primary one and a
dual one, both defined on general unstructured simplex meshes in multiple space
dimensions. Our new schemes extend existing cell-centered finite volume methods
based on corner fluxes to arbitrary high order of accuracy in space. An
important feature of our new method is the fact that only two different
discrete function spaces are needed to represent the numerical solution, and
the choice of the appropriate function space for each variable is related to
the origin and nature of the underlying PDE. The first class of variables is
discretized at the aid of a discontinuous Galerkin approach, where the
numerical solution is represented via piecewise polynomials of degree N and
which are allowed to jump across element interfaces. This set of variables is
related to those PDE which are mere consequences of the definitions, derived
from some abstract scalar and vector potentials, and for which involutions like
the divergence-free or the curl-free property must hold if satisfied by the
initial data. The second class of variables is discretized via classical
continuous Lagrange finite elements of approximation degree M=N+1 and is
related to those PDE which can be derived as the Euler-Lagrange equations of an
underlying variational principle.

## Beyond Gaussian Assumptions: A Nonlinear Generalization of Linear Inverse Modeling

**Authors:** Justin Lien, Hiroyasu Ando
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.NA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24234v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The Linear Inverse Model (LIM) is a class of data-driven methods that
construct approximate linear stochastic models to represent complex
observational data. The stochastic forcing can be modeled using either Gaussian
white noise or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise; the corresponding models are
called White-LIM and Colored-LIM, respectively. Although LIMs are widely
applied in climate sciences, they inherently approximate observed distributions
as Gaussian, limiting their ability to capture asymmetries.
  In this study, we extend LIMs to incorporate nonlinear dynamics, introducing
White-nLIM and Colored-nLIM which allow for a more flexible and accurate
representation of complex dynamics from observations. The proposed methods not
only account for the nonlinear nature of the underlying system but also
effectively capture the skewness of the observed distribution. Moreover, we
apply these methods to a lower-dimensional representation of ENSO and
demonstrate that both White-nLIM and Colored-nLIM successfully capture its
nonlinear characteristic.

## A Graph Random Walk Method for Calculating Time-of-Flight Charge Mobility in Organic Semiconductors from Multiscale Simulations

**Categories:** cond-mat.stat-mech, math.PR, physics.comp-ph, 05C81, 05C90, 60J22, 60J74
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15836v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport
properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The
molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed
weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights
are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along
the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved
vertices and an interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk
to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments,
charge carriers are injected into the material and the time until they reach a
collecting electrode is recorded. Our approach allows direct evaluation of the
expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in terms of a sparse, linear
system, avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone
methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional
Master Equation or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach
by numerical studies of charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in
diffusive and drift-diffusive regimes using a surrogate lattice model of a
realistic material whose properties have been simulated within a multiscale
model framework combining quantum-mechanical and molecular-mechanics methods.
The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder
from the reference baseline. Comparison with results from the Master Equation
confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical
implementations. We further show that KMC results show substantial deviations
due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a
powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues
and with the benefit of making use of sparse matrix methods.

## Effects of the delocalized charge distribution in trapped ion-atom collisions

**Categories:** physics.atom-ph, physics.chem-ph, physics.comp-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23690v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In the study of ion-atom interactions, the ion often remain trapped during
the experiments. However, the effects of the trapping potential of the ion on
ion-neutral interactions remain largely unexplored. Although trap-assisted
ion-neutral complex formation has been experimentally studied and described by
applying semiclassical theories where the ion is treated as a point charge
particle, the potential effect of a delocalized charge distribution of a
confined ion due to its quantum mechanical wavefunction has not been
considered. To remedy this, in the present theoretical work we substitute the
point charge of the ion with a delocalized charged distribution according to
its motional ground state in the trap. Our results show that the trapping
frequency and hence the spatial extension of the ion's ground-state
wavefunction drastically affects the elastic and transport cross sections in
interactions with neutral atoms. Stimulated by these results, we propose
experimental procedures to verify the effects of the delocalize charge
distribution in ion-atom interactions via measuring the heating rate of the ion
due to the energy transfer in atomic collisions. Our novel approach brings new
possibilities for investigating ion-neutral systems and, through them, new
perspectives on ionic polarons and potentially a better understanding of
trap-induced losses in ion-neutral experiments.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The polymorphism and mechanism of helium compounds is crucial for
understanding the physical and chemical nature of He-bearing materials under
pressures. Here, we predict two new types of He-bearing compounds, MgHe and
MgnHe (n = 6, 8, 10, 15, 18), being formed above 750 GPa by unbiased ab initio
structure search. An unexpected bandgap is opened up in MgHe at as low as
around 200 GPa. This is the first case of noble gas driven metal-nonmetal
transition in all elements. The same mechanism is demonstrated also being
applicable to other metallic elements, and making beryllium transform into a
non-metallic state, a triumph that is impossible otherwise. Furthermore, the
stability of the simple cubic phase of Mg (Mg-sc) is greatly enhanced by mixing
with He, which lowers the critical pressure of pure Mg-sc from about 1.1 TPa
down to 750 GPa to form ordered substitutional alloying phase of MgnHe on a
simple cubic lattice of Mg. This is the first report on Mg-based noble gas
substitutional alloy, in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that He
preferring interstitial sites. The observed striking influences of He
demonstrate the rich physics and chemistry of He-bearing compounds under
ultra-high pressures.

## Electronic structure of UGe$_2$ at ambient pressure: comparison with X-ray photoemission spectra

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Based on experimental crystallographic data, electronic structure of UGe$_2$
have been calculated and compared with our results of X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. We employed two different advanced full
potential (FP) methods: FP-local-orbital (FPLO) and FP-linear augmented plane
waves (Wien2k) codes for non-magnetic and ferromagnetic states. Starting from
the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) or generalised gradient
approximation (GGA), we verified either the orbital polarisation (OP)
correction or the GGA+U approach for the U 5f-electrons, changing
Coulomb-repulsion energies U in the range 0-4 eV. Satisfying agreement was
achieved between experimental and our calculated magnetic moments using
ab-initio LSDA+OP and non-ab-initio GGA+U approaches, the latter for realistic
U values of 2-3 eV. We proved by the LSDA+OP approach an existence of the Fermi
surface nesting vector along the a axis, possibly responsible for the triplet
superconducting pairing. The calculated data reveal predominantly an itinerant
U 5f-electron character of bands near the Fermi level, EF, with only small
contributions from the U 6d and Ge 4p states. The experimental XPS spectrum of
valence bands (VB) also contains the sharp main 5f-electron peak at EF, a wide
hump (around -2 eV), and broad small peaks at higher energies. In the
calculated XPS spectrum, the width of the main 5f-electron peak varies between
0.8 and 1.4 eV, depending on a method used in computations, but the hump
remains unresolved. A newly observed asymmetric 1-eV satellite in the
experimental 4f-core XPS spectrum together with known 3-eV and 7-eV satellites
suggest dual behaviour of U-5f-electrons in UGe$_2$, the feature is inferred
also from the VB studies.

## Stability of Schrödinger bridges and Sinkhorn semigroups for log-concave models

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15963v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this article we obtain several new results and developments in the study
of entropic optimal transport problems (a.k.a. Schr\"odinger problems) with
general reference distributions and log-concave target marginal measures. Our
approach combines transportation cost inequalities
  with the theory of Riccati matrix difference equations arising in filtering
and optimal control theory. This methodology is partly based on a novel
entropic stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and closed form expressions of a
class of discrete time algebraic Riccati equations. In the context of
regularized entropic transport these techniques provide new sharp entropic map
estimates. When applied to the stability of Sinkhorn semigroups, they also
yield
  a series of novel contraction estimates in terms of the fixed point of
Riccati equations.
  The strength of our approach is that it is applicable to a large class of
models arising in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. We
illustrate the impact of our results in the context of regularized entropic
transport, proximal samplers and diffusion generative models as well as
diffusion flow matching models

## Deviation Between Team-Optimal Solution and Nash Equilibrium in Flow Assignment Problems

**Authors:** Gehui Xu, Ting Bai, Andreas A. Malikopoulos, Thomas Parisini
**Categories:** cs.GT, math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23991v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We investigate the relationship between the team-optimal solution and the
Nash equilibrium (NE) to assess the impact of strategy deviation on team
performance. As a working use case, we focus on a class of flow assignment
problems in which each source node acts as a cooperating decision maker (DM)
within a team that minimizes the team cost based on the team-optimal strategy.
In practice, some selfish DMs may prioritize their own marginal cost and
deviate from NE strategies, thus potentially degrading the overall performance.
To quantify this deviation, we explore the deviation bound between the
team-optimal solution and the NE in two specific scenarios: (i) when the
team-optimal solution is unique and (ii) when multiple solutions do exist. This
helps DMs analyze the factors influencing the deviation and adopting the NE
strategy within a tolerable range. Furthermore, in the special case of a
potential game model, we establish the consistency between the team-optimal
solution and the NE. Once the consistency condition is satisfied, the strategy
deviation does not alter the total cost, and DMs do not face a strategic
trade-off. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis through some
simulation studies.

## Forward-backward splitting in bilaterally bounded Alexandrov spaces

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24126v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
With the goal of solving optimisation problems on non-Riemannian manifolds,
such as geometrical surfaces with sharp edges, we develop and prove the
convergence of a forward-backward method in Alexandrov spaces with curvature
bounded both from above and from below. This bilateral boundedness is crucial
for the availability of both the gradient and proximal steps, instead of just
one or the other. We numerically demonstrate the behaviour of the proposed
method on simple geometrical surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

## Accelerated Approximate Optimization of Multi-Commodity Flows on Directed Graphs

**Authors:** Li Chen, Andrei Graur, Aaron Sidford
**Categories:** cs.DS, math.OC
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24373v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We provide $m^{1+o(1)}k\epsilon^{-1}$-time algorithms for computing
multiplicative $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximate solutions to multi-commodity flow
problems with $k$-commodities on $m$-edge directed graphs, including concurrent
multi-commodity flow and maximum multi-commodity flow.
  To obtain our results, we provide new optimization tools of potential
independent interest. First, we provide an improved optimization method for
solving $\ell_{q, p}$-regression problems to high accuracy. This method makes
$\tilde{O}_{q, p}(k)$ queries to a high accuracy convex minimization oracle for
an individual block, where $\tilde{O}_{q, p}(\cdot)$ hides factors depending
only on $q$, $p$, or $\mathrm{poly}(\log m)$, improving upon the $\tilde{O}_{q,
p}(k^2)$ bound of [Chen-Ye, ICALP 2024]. As a result, we obtain the first
almost-linear time algorithm that solves $\ell_{q, p}$ flows on directed graphs
to high accuracy. Second, we present optimization tools to reduce approximately
solving composite $\ell_{1, \infty}$-regression problems to solving
$m^{o(1)}\epsilon^{-1}$ instances of composite $\ell_{q, p}$-regression
problem. The method builds upon recent advances in solving box-simplex games
[Jambulapati-Tian, NeurIPS 2023] and the area convex regularizer introduced in
[Sherman, STOC 2017] to obtain faster rates for constrained versions of the
problem. Carefully combining these techniques yields our directed
multi-commodity flow algorithm.

## "Nonlocality-of-a-single-photon'' based Quantum Key Distribution and Random Number Generation schemes and their device-independent security analysis

**Authors:** Konrad Schlichtholz, Bianka Woloncewicz, Tamoghna Das, Marcin Markiewicz, Marek Żukowski
**Categories:** quant-ph

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07451v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The question of ``non-locality of a single photon'', which started with a
paper by Tan, Walls and Collett (TWC, 1991) stirred a thirty years long debate.
This hampered attempts to use the TWC interferometric scheme in quantum
cryptography. The scheme involves a single photon 50-50 beam-split into two
modes propagating to two spatially separated observation stations at which weak
homodyne measurements are made. The physics and non-classicality of such an
arrangement has been understood only recently, and points out that an
unquestionable Bell non-classicality, as was suggested by Hardy (1994), can be
observed when the local measurement settings differ by the weak local
oscillator being on or off, and additionally the homodyning for the on case is
not balanced. Based on that, we present a single-photon based
device-independent quantum key distribution scheme secure even against
no-signaling eavesdropping. In our protocol the random bits of the
cryptographic key are obtained by measurements on the single photon, that is
for off settings at both Alice and Bob sides, while the security is positively
tested if for eavesdropping testing runs one observes a violation of a specific
Bell inequality involving the on and off weak homodyne measurements as
alternative local settings. The security analysis presented here is based on a
decomposition of the correlations into extreme points of a no-signaling
polytope, which allows for identification of the optimal strategy for any
eavesdropping constrained only by the no-signaling principle. For this
strategy, the key rate is calculated, which is then connected with the
violation of a specific Clauser-Horne inequality. We also adapt this analysis
to propose a self-testing quantum random number generator based on the old idea
that employs the randomness of reflection and transmission events of a quantum
light impinged on a 50-50 beamsplitter.

**Abstract:**
We propose a method for the estimation of the initial polarization of spinful
nuclei of the 13 C isotope in diamond via a measurement of the evolution of the
coherence of an NV center spin qubit. Existing polarization measurement methods
are difficult to implement experimentally, because they require direct
interference in the environment of the qubit. Here, in order to obtain the
information, it is necessary to measure the qubit coherence at certain points
of time, which are unambiguously determined by the applied magnetic field. For
sufficiently high magnetic fields, the minimum value of the measured coherence
constitutes an upper bound on the product of the initial polarizations of each
environmental spin. The most significant advantage of the method, which allows
to infer initial values of nuclear polarizations without any direct access to
the environment, lies in its simplicity and the small amount of experimental
resources that it requires. We exemplify the operation of the scheme on a
realistic, randomly generated environment of eight nuclear spins, obtaining a
reasonably accurate estimation of the initial polarization.

**Abstract:**
In recent years, time correlators have received renewed attention, especially
under the guise of identifiers of nonclassical correlations. However, the
physical interpretation of these objects, and more generally of multi-times
variables, remains ambiguous, which may be one of the reasons why they are so
difficult to measure. In this work, we introduce and advance the perspective
that a two-time correlator should actually be regarded as an average involving
a novel single physical observable, one that cannot be rephrased in terms of
the primitive ones, according to quantum principles. In particular, we provide
examples showing that the presumed constituents of a two-time correlator and
the proposed two-time operator itself cannot be simultaneous elements of the
physical reality.

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces quantum edge detection, aimed at locating boundaries of
quantum domains where all particles share the same pure state. Focusing on the
1D scenario of a string of particles, we develop an optimal protocol for
quantum edge detection, efficiently computing its success probability through
Schur-Weyl duality and semidefinite programming techniques. We analyze the
behavior of the success probability as a function of the string length and
local dimension, with emphasis in the limit of long strings. We present a
protocol based on square root measurement, which proves asymptotically optimal.
Additionally, we explore a mixed quantum change point detection scenario where
the state of particles transitions from known to unknown, which may find
practical applications in detecting malfunctions in quantum devices

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Non-projective measurements play a crucial role in various
information-processing protocols. In this work, we propose an operational task
to identify measurements that are neither projective nor classical
post-processing of data obtained from projective measurements. Our setup
involves space-like separated parties with access to a shared state with
bounded local dimensions. Specifically, in the case of qubits, we focus on a
bipartite scenario with different sets of target correlations. While some of
these correlations can be obtained through non-projective measurements on a
shared two-qubit state, it is impossible to generate these correlations using
{\it projective simulable} measurements on bipartite qubit states, or
equivalently, by using one bit of shared randomness and local post-processing.
For certain target correlations, we show that detecting qubit non-projective
measurements is robust under {\it arbitrary} depolarising noise, except in the
limiting case. We extend this task for qutrits and demonstrate that some
correlations achievable via local non-projective measurements cannot be
reproduced by both parties performing the same qutrit {\it projective
simulable} measurements on their pre-shared state. We provide numerical
evidence for the robustness of this scheme under {\it arbitrary} depolarising
noise. For a more generic consideration (bipartite and tripartite scenario), we
provide numerical evidence for a projective-simulable bound on the reward
function for our task. We also show a violation of this bound by using qutrit
POVMs. From a foundational perspective, we extend the notion of non-projective
measurements to general probabilistic theories (GPTs) and use a randomness-free
test to demonstrate that a class of GPTs, called {\it square-bits or box-world}
are unphysical.

## Development of a bipolar 50 V output digital-to-analog converter system for ion-shuttling operations

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) is one of the notable architectures
to achieve large-scale trapped-ion quantum computers. To realize QCCD
architecture, ions must be transported quickly while minimizing motional
excitation. High-voltage sources are necessary to achieve such high-quality ion
transport through a high secular frequency. In this study, we report the
development of a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based digital-to-analog
converter (DAC) system with an output voltage range of +/-50 V and demonstrate
its effectiveness in ion transport operations. The device provides 16-channel
analog output, maximum update rate of 16 mega updates per second (MUPS), slew
rate of 20 V/us, and bandwidth of > 200 kHz. By optimizing the voltage sets
with quadratic programming, we experimentally confirmed that this DAC system
can achieve more than twice the secular frequency attainable when its output
range is restricted to +/-10 V, which is consistent with the fact that scaling
all electrode voltages by a factor of 5 will scale the secular frequency by the
square root of 5. Since the output range of many commercially available DACs is
commonly limited to +/-10 V, this increase is effective for ion shuttling
operations, such as transport, split and merge. The developed DAC system has
potential to increase the speed of ion transport thereby reducing processing
times in QCCD-based quantum computers.

## Monotones in Resource Theories for Dynamical Decoupling

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11595v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In arXiv:2110.02613, we presented a generalised dynamical resource theory
framework that enabled noise reduction techniques including dynamical
decoupling (DD) to be studied. While this fundamental contribution remains
correct, it has been found that the main resource quantifiers we employed to
study these resource theories -- based on the relative entropies between Choi
states of multitime processes -- are not monotonic under the allowed
transformations. In this letter we detail modified relative entropy-based
resource quantifiers, prove that they are indeed monotonic in our resource
theories. We re-interpret our numerical results in terms of these new relative
entropy monotones, arriving at the same empirical conclusions: DD can be
understood as temporal resource distillation, and improvements to noise
reduction via our multitimescale optimal dynamical decoupling (MODD) method
coincide with a decrease in the corresponding non-Markovianity monotone.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Quantum computing applications in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
era require algorithms that can generate shallower circuits feasible for
today's quantum systems. This is particularly challenging for quantum chemistry
applications due to the inherent complexity of molecular systems. Working with
pharmaceutically relevant molecules containing sulfonyl fluoride ($SO_2F$)
warheads used in targeted covalent drug development, we combine Hamiltonian
terms truncation, Clifford Decomposition and Transformation (CDAT), and
optimized transpilation techniques to achieve up to a 28.5-fold reduction in
circuit depth when assuming all-to-all connectivity of quantum hardware. When
employed on IBMQ's Heron architecture, we demonstrate up to a 15.5-fold
reduction. Through these methods, we reduced circuit depths to 1330 gates for
8-qubit Hamiltonian dynamics simulations. Using middleware solutions for
circuit decomposition, we successfully executed sub-circuits with depths up to
371 gates containing 216 2-qubit gates, representing one of the largest
electronic structure Hamiltonian dynamics calculations implemented on current
quantum hardware. The systematic circuit reduction approach shows promise for
scaling to larger active spaces, while maintaining sufficient accuracy for
molecular reactivity predictions using the Quantum-Centric Data-Driven R&D
framework. This work highlights practical methods for exploring commercially
relevant chemistry problems on quantum hardware through Hamiltonian simulation,
with direct applications to pharmaceutical drug development.

## Advantages and limitations of channel multiplexing for discrete-variable quantum key distribution

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16007v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Typically practical realizations of discrete-variable quantum key
distribution (QKD) protocols, based on exchanging single-photon signals between
the trusted parties, can provide its users with only very low key generation
rates. One of the potential solutions for this problem, that can be adapted for
the case of entanglement-based QKD schemes using broadband photon-pair sources,
is to utilize wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) modules in order to split
the photons with different wavelengths to separate detection channels and
generate multiple keys in parallel. Here, we theoretically investigate this
idea in the case of pulsed laser used to pump spontaneous parametric
down-conversion source. We optimize the effective phase-matching function width
of the nonlinear crystal, and the intensity and duration of the pump laser
pulses in order to maximize the advantage of the overall key generation rate
provided by the WDM-based QKD scheme over the traditional no-WDM scenario. The
results of our analysis show that the considered method can significantly
accelerate the production of cryptographic keys, but proper optimization of the
photon-pair source is needed to exploit its full potential.

## Distributed quantum error correction based on hyperbolic Floquet codes

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14029v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Quantum computing offers significant speedups, but the large number of
physical qubits required for quantum error correction introduces engineering
challenges for a monolithic architecture. One solution is to distribute the
logical quantum computation across multiple small quantum computers, with
non-local operations enabled via distributed Bell states. Previous
investigations of distributed quantum error correction have largely focused on
the surface code, which offers good error suppression but poor encoding rates,
with each surface code instance only able to encode a single logical qubit. In
this work, we argue that hyperbolic Floquet codes are particularly well-suited
to distributed quantum error correction for two reasons. Firstly, their
hyperbolic structure enables a high number of logical qubits to be stored
efficiently. Secondly, the fact that all measurements are between pairs of
qubits means that each measurement only requires a single Bell state. Through
simulations, we show that distributed hyperbolic Floquet codes offer good
performance under local and non-local circuit-level noise. This shows that
distributed quantum error correction is not only possible but efficiently
realisable.

## Construction of new type of CNOT gate using cross-resonance pulse in the transmon-PPQ system

**Authors:** Jeongsoo Kang, Younghun Kwon
**Categories:** quant-ph

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15218v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The transmon, known for its fast operation time and the coherence time of
tens of microseconds, is the most commonly used qubit for superconducting
quantum processors. However, it is still necessary to enhance the coherence
time and the gate fidelity of superconducting quantum processors for the
practical implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computing. Meanwhile, a
novel superconducting qubit, which has the ability to protect the Cooper-pair
parity on the superconducting island, has been proposed. This new qubit shows
better coherence performance than the transmon, but it does not yet have an
efficient method for realizing a superconducting hybrid system that harnesses
it.
  In this work, we show how to implement a new type of CNOT gate in a
superconducting hybrid system composed of tunable transmon and parity-protected
qubit by applying a cross-resonance pulse. First, we provide hardware
specifications and pulse parameters to construct a successful two-qubit gate in
the hybrid system. Second, we show that our method can supply a CNOT gate of
average fidelity with more than 0.998. Therefore, our work implies that the
hybrid system may provide a new platform for quantum computers.

## Demolition measurement protocol for transmon qubits

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18322v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The process of measuring a qubit and re-initializing it to the ground state
practically lead to long qubit idle times between re-runs of experiments on a
superconducting quantum computer. Here, we propose a protocol for a
\textit{demolition measurement} of a transmon qubit that integrates qubit
readout with the reset process to minimize qubit idle time. We present a
three-staged implementation of this protocol, involving a combined qubit
readout and resonator reset scheme that unconditionally resets the resonator at
the end of the readout; a leakage removal scheme that can be integrated with
the measurement stage; and an unconditional qubit reset. We demonstrate that
this protocol could be implemented in $1 \, \mu$s with greater than $95 \, \%$
reset fidelity and a $99 \, \%$ readout fidelity without any hardware overhead
beyond those commonly used. This provides at least a 50x speed up compared to
the passive decay of the qubit, thereby significantly increasing the
data-acquisition rate.

## On the Random Schrödinger Equation and Geometric Quantum Control

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04617v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We introduce the random Schr\"odinger equation, with a noise term given by a
random Hermitian matrix as a means to model noisy quantum systems. We derive
bounds on the error of the synthesised unitary in terms of bounds on the norm
of the noise, and show that for certain noise processes these bounds are tight.
We then show that in certain situations, minimising the error is equivalent to
finding a geodesic on SU (n) with respect to a Riemannian metric encoding the
coupling between the control pulse and the noise process. Our work thus extends
the series of seminal papers by Nielsen et al. on the geometry of quantum gate
complexity.

## Feedback Connections in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Mid-Circuit Measurements

**Categories:** quant-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22380v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Existing approaches to quantum reservoir computing can be broadly categorized
into restart-based and continuous protocols. Restart-based methods require
reinitializing the quantum circuit for each time step, while continuous
protocols use mid-circuit measurements to enable uninterrupted information
processing. A gap exists between these two paradigms: While restart-based
methods naturally have high execution times due to the need for circuit
reinitialization, they can employ novel feedback connections to enhance
performance. In contrast, continuous methods have significantly faster
execution times but typically lack such feedback mechanisms. In this work, we
investigate a novel quantum reservoir computing scheme that integrates feedback
connections, which can operate within the coherence time of a qubit. We
demonstrate our architecture using a minimal example and evaluate memory
capacity and predictive capabilities. We show that the correlation coefficient
for the short-term memory task on past inputs is nonzero, indicating that
feedback connections can effectively operate during continuous processing to
allow the model to remember past inputs.

## Predicting the von Neumann Entanglement Entropy Using a Graph Neural Network

**Authors:** Anas Saleh
**Categories:** quant-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23635v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Calculating the von Neumann entanglement entropy from experimental data is
challenging due to its dependence on the complete wavefunction, forcing
reliance on approximations like classical mutual information (MI). We propose a
machine learning approach using a graph neural network for predicting the von
Neumann entropy from experimentally accessible bitstrings. We tested this
approach on a Rydberg ladder system and achieved a mean absolute error of $3.7
\times 10^{-3}$ when testing it inside of its training range on a dataset with
entropy ranging from 0 to 1.9, we also evaluated the mean absolute percentage
error on the data that have its entropy larger than 0.01 of the maximum
entropy(so we can avoid the areas of our phase space with near zero entropy)
and got a relative error of 1.72%, outperforming MI-based bounds. When tested
beyond this range, the model still delivers reasonable results. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that fine tuning the model with a small dataset significantly
improves its performance on data outside its original training range.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Quantum correlations and non-classical states are indispensable resources for
advancing quantum technologies, and their resilience at finite temperatures is
crucial for practical experimental implementations. The two-qubit quantum Rabi
model (2QQRM), a natural extension of the quantum Rabi model, describes two
qubits coupled to a single bosonic mode and has been extensively studied in
cavity quantum electrodynamics, superconducting circuits, and quantum
information science. In this work, we investigate the persistence of quantum
correlations and non-classical states in the 2QQRM at thermal equilibrium,
focusing on the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. Through a
systematic analysis of quantumness quantifiers, we demonstrate the emergence of
long-lived quantum correlations, even in the presence of thermal noise.
Notably, we uncover striking phenomena arising from the interplay between
detuning and deep strong-coupling: in the high-frequency limit, where the qubit
energy exceeds the cavity-mode energy, quantum criticality emerges, leading to
a high degree of photon squeezing. In contrast, the opposite regime is
characterized by robust qubit-qubit quantum correlations. Importantly, we show
that both dispersive regimes exhibit quantum features that are remarkably
robust to parameter fluctuations, making them advantageous for maintaining
quantum coherence. These results highlight the exceptional resilience of
quantum resources in the 2QQRM and provide valuable insights for developing
quantum technologies operating under realistic, finite-temperature conditions.

## Undecidable problems associated with variational quantum algorithms

**Categories:** quant-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23723v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA),
are widely studied as candidates for near-term quantum advantage. Recent work
has shown that training VQAs is NP-hard in general. In this paper, we present a
conditional result suggesting that the training of VQAs is undecidable, even in
idealized, noiseless settings. We reduce the decision version of the digitized
VQA training problem-where circuit parameters are drawn from a discrete set-to
the question of whether a universal Diophantine equation (UDE) has a root. This
reduction relies on encoding the UDE into the structure of a variational
quantum circuit via the matrix exponentials. The central step involves
establishing a correspondence between the objective function of the VQA and a
known UDE of 58 variables and degree 4. Our main result is conditional on a
natural conjecture: that a certain system of structured complex polynomial
equations-arising from the inner product of a VQA circuit output and a fixed
observable-has at least one solution. We argue this conjecture is plausible
based on dimension-counting arguments (degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonians,
state vector, and observable), and the generic solvability of such systems in
algebraic geometry over the complex numbers. Under this assumption, we suggest
that deciding whether a digitized VQA achieves a given energy threshold is
undecidable. This links the limitations of variational quantum algorithms to
foundational questions in mathematics and logic, extending the known landscape
of quantum computational hardness to include uncomputability. Additionally, we
establish an unconditional undecidability result for VQA convergence in open
quantum systems.

**Abstract:**
Solid neon has emerged as a pristine material host for electron qubits.
Single electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have shown extraordinarily
long coherence times and high operation fidelities. Realizing two-qubit gates
in this platform is the next major step for realistic quantum information
processing. In this work, we demonstrate frequency- and time-domain coherent
manipulation of multiple eNe charge qubits that are coupled by short-range
charge interactions. Cross-resonance and bSWAP two-qubit gates are implemented,
laying the foundation for universal quantum computing. An inter-qubit coupling
strength exceeding 60~MHz has been observed, promising fast gate speed and
suppressed infidelity. These results highlight the potential to scale up the
eNe qubit platform toward universal quantum computing.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Hybrid integrated quantum photonics combines solid-state artificial atoms
with reconfigurable photonic circuits, enabling scalable chip-based quantum
networks. Self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) are ideal for this goal due to
their ability to generate highly indistinguishable single photons with
exceptional brightness. Integrating QDs into low-loss photonic circuits can
facilitate complex quantum networks by enabling entanglement transfer via
two-photon interference. However, challenges such as limited scalability,
spectral inhomogeneity, and quantum interference between independent sources
remain. We present a hybrid photonic architecture that integrates QD-containing
waveguides with low-loss lithium niobate (LN) circuits, incorporating 20
deterministic single-photon sources (SPSs). Using the piezoelectric properties
of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), we achieve on-chip local spectral tuning
of QD emissions by up to 7.7 meV,three orders of magnitude greater than the
transform-limited linewidth. This approach enables on-chip quantum interference
with a visibility of 0.73 between two spatially separated QD SPSs connected by
0.48 mm long waveguides, establishing a functional quantum network.The
large-scale integration of spectrally tunable QD-based SPSs into low-loss LN
circuits, combined with fast electro-optical switching, paves the way for
compact, lightweight, and scalable photonic quantum networks.

**Abstract:**
There is currently a huge effort to understand the potential and limitations
of variational quantum machine learning (QML) based on the optimization of
parameterized quantum circuits. Recent proposals toward dequantizing
variational QML models for regression problems include approaches based on
kernel methods with carefully chosen kernel functions, approximated via Random
Fourier Features (RFF). In this short note we show that for a wide range of
instances, this approach can be simplified. More specifically, we show that the
kernels whose evaluation is approximated by RFF in this dequantization
algorithm can in fact often be evaluated exactly and efficiently classically.
As such, our results enhance the toolkit for kernel-based dequantization of
variational QML.

## Simulation of Shor algorithm for discrete logarithm problems with comprehensive pairs of modulo p and order q

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23939v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The discrete logarithm problem (DLP) over finite fields, commonly used in
classical cryptography, has no known polynomial-time algorithm on classical
computers. However, Shor has provided its polynomial-time algorithm on quantum
computers. Nevertheless, there are only few examples simulating quantum
circuits that operate on general pairs of modulo $p$ and order $q$. In this
paper, we constructed such quantum circuits and solved DLPs for all 1,860
possible pairs of $p$ and $q$ up to 32 qubits using a quantum simulator with
PRIMEHPC FX700. From this, we obtained and verified values of the success
probabilities, which had previously been heuristically analyzed by Eker\r{a}.
As a result, we found that the success probability of Shor's algorithm for
solving the DLP exhibits periodicity with an asymmetric waveform determined by
the order $q$. Additionally, we generated 1,015 quantum circuits for larger
pairs of $p$ and $q$, extrapolated the circuit sizes obtained, and compared
them for $p=2048$ bits between safe-prime groups and Schnorr groups. While in
classical cryptography, the cipher strength of safe-prime groups and Schnorr
groups is the same if $p$ is equal, we quantitatively demonstrated how much the
strength of the latter decreases to the bit length of $p$ in the former when
using Shor's quantum algorithm. In particular, it was experimentally and
theoretically shown that when a ripple carry adder is used in the addition
circuit, the cryptographic strength of a Schnorr group with $p=2048$ bits under
Shor's algorithm is almost equivalent to that of a safe-prime group with
$p=1024$ bits.

## Choco-Q: Commute Hamiltonian-based QAOA for Constrained Binary Optimization

**Authors:** Debin Xiang, Qifan Jiang, Liqiang Lu, Siwei Tan, Jianwei Yin

**Abstract:**
Constrained binary optimization aims to find an optimal assignment to
minimize or maximize the objective meanwhile satisfying the constraints, which
is a representative NP problem in various domains, including transportation,
scheduling, and economy. Quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA)
provide a promising methodology for solving this problem by exploiting the
parallelism of quantum entanglement. However, existing QAOA approaches based on
penalty-term or Hamiltonian simulation fail to thoroughly encode the
constraints, leading to extremely low success rate and long searching latency.
  This paper proposes Choco-Q, a formal and universal framework for constrained
binary optimization problems, which comprehensively covers all constraints and
exhibits high deployability for current quantum devices. The main innovation of
Choco-Q is to embed the commute Hamiltonian as the driver Hamiltonian,
resulting in a much more general encoding formulation that can deal with
arbitrary linear constraints. Leveraging the arithmetic features of commute
Hamiltonian, we propose three optimization techniques to squeeze the overall
circuit complexity, including Hamiltonian serialization, equivalent
decomposition, and variable elimination. The serialization mechanism transforms
the original Hamiltonian into smaller ones. Our decomposition methods only take
linear time complexity, achieving end-to-end acceleration. Experiments
demonstrate that Choco-Q shows more than 235$\times$ algorithmic improvement in
successfully finding the optimal solution, and achieves 4.69$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration, compared to prior QAOA designs.

**Abstract:**
Quantum computing has recently been emerging in theoretical chemistry as a
realistic avenue meant to offer computational speedup to challenging
eigenproblems in the context of strongly-correlated molecular systems or
extended materials. Most studies so far have been devoted to the quantum
treatment of electronic structure and only a few were directed to the quantum
treatment of vibrational structure, which at the moment remains not devoid of
unknowns. In particular, we address here a formal problem that arises when
simulating a vibrational model under harmonic second quantization, whereby the
disruption of the closure relation (resolution of the identity) -- which occurs
when truncating the infinite bosonic basis set -- may have some serious effects
as regards the correct evaluation of Hamiltonian matrix elements. This relates
intimately to the normal ordering of products of ladder operators. In addition,
we discuss the relevance of choosing an adequate primitive basis set within the
present context with respect to its variational convergence properties. Such
fundamental, yet consequential, aspects are illustrated numerically in the
present work on a one-dimensional anharmonic Hamiltonian model corresponding to
a double-well potential showing strong tunneling, of interest both for
vibrational spectroscopy and chemical reactivity.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Coherent control by means of tailored excitation is a key to versatile
experimental schemes for spectroscopic investigation and technological
utilization of quantum systems. Here we study a quantum system which consists
of a coupled electron-moun spin state, i.e., muonium, a light isotope of
hydrogen. We demonstrate the most fundamental coherent control techniques by
microwave excitation of spin transitions, namely driven Rabi oscillations and
Ramsey fringes upon free evolution. Unprecedented performance is achieved by
the microwave hardware devised for these experiments, which enables coherent
spin manipulation of individual, isolated, muonium centers. For muonium formed
in SiO$_2$ with strong electron-muon hyperfine interaction, a virtually
undamped free precession signal is observed up to a 3.5 $\mu$s time window. For
muonium formed in Si with weak and anisotropic hyperfine interaction, a strong
drive at the multi-quantum transition decouples the muonium center from its
magnetic environment formed by the bath of $^{29}$Si nuclear spins at natural
abundance. We expect that these capabilities will provide a powerful tool to
investigate the effect of the environment on isolated coupled spins, uncover
the details of coupled electron-muon systems in matter and validate quantum
electrodynamics in the context of muonium spectroscopy.

## Giant counter-rotating oscillations on the attosecond timescale

**Authors:** Jakob Nicolai Bruhnke, Edvin Olofsson, Axel Stenquist, Jan Marcus Dahlström
**Categories:** quant-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24038v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We predict an unexplored type of ultrastrong coupling between atoms and
intense ultraviolet light that leads to giant population oscillations on the
attosecond timescale. These counter-rotating oscillations can be of similar
amplitude as the elementary femtosecond Rabi oscillations between the two
strongly coupled states. The effect, which is beyond the two-level atom, is
non-reciprocal: It only affects the excited state, while the ground state is
unaffected. We propose that two-photon Rabi oscillations (1s$^2$-1s3d) in
helium is suitable for the generation of this type of ultrastrong coupling with
realistic pulses. We use a combination of Floquet theory and effective
Hamiltonian theory to test our predictions against ab initio simulations.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We propose the realization of a mechanically squeezed Kerr oscillator with a
single ion in a tapered trap. We show that the motion coupling between the
axial and radial modes caused by the trap geometry leads to Kerr nonlinearity
of the radial mode with magnitude controlled by the trap frequencies. This
allows the realization of non-Gaussian quantum gates, which play a significant
role in the universal set of continuous variable quantum gates. Furthermore, we
show that, because of the nonlinearity of the ion trap, applying an
off-resonant time-varying electric field along the trap axis causes a motion
squeezing of the radial mode. Finally, we discuss the motion mode frequency
spectrum of an ion crystal in a tapered trap. We show that the frequency gap
between the motion modes increases with trap nonlinearity, which benefits the
realization of faster quantum gates.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field with significant
potential, yet it remains highly susceptible to noise, which poses a major
challenge to its practical implementation. While various noise mitigation
strategies have been proposed to enhance algorithmic performance, the impact of
noise is not fully understood. In this work, we investigate the effects of
amplitude and phase damping noise on a quantum reinforcement learning
algorithm. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we assess how these noise
sources influence the learning process and overall performance. Our findings
contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of noise in quantum learning
algorithms and suggest that, rather than being purely detrimental, unavoidable
noise may present opportunities to enhance QML processes.

## Resource reduction for variational quantum algorithms by non-demolition measurements

**Categories:** quant-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24090v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We present a comparative study of two implementations of a variational
quantum algorithm aimed at minimizing the energy of a complex quantum system.
In one implementation, we extract the information of the energy gradient by
projective measurements. In the second implementation, called the
Non-Demolition approach, the gradient information is stored in a quantum
detector, which is eventually measured. As prototypical examples, we study the
energy minimization of the Lithium-based molecules and then extend the analysis
systems with increased complexity. We find that, while both approaches are able
to identify the energy minimum, the Non-Demolition approach has a clear
advantage in terms of the overall computational resources needed. This
advantage increases linearly with the complexity of the quantum system, making
the Non-Demolition approach the ideal candidate to implement such variational
quantum algorithms.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Quantum process characterization is a fundamental task in quantum information
processing, yet conventional methods, such as quantum process tomography,
require prohibitive resources and lack scalability. Here, we introduce an
efficient quantum process learning method specifically designed for short-time
Hamiltonian dynamics. Our approach reconstructs an equivalent quantum circuit
representation from measurement data of unknown Hamiltonian evolution without
requiring additional assumptions and achieves polynomial sample and
computational efficiency. Our results have broad applications in various
directions. We demonstrate applications in quantum machine learning, where our
protocol enables efficient training of variational quantum neural networks by
directly learning unitary transformations. Additionally, it facilitates the
prediction of quantum expectation values with provable efficiency and provides
a robust framework for verifying quantum computations and benchmarking
realistic noisy quantum hardware. This work establishes a new theoretical
foundation for practical quantum dynamics learning, paving the way for scalable
quantum process characterization in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum
computing.

## Closing the detection loophole in the triangle network with high-dimensional photonic states

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24213v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Bell nonlocality without input settings, e.g. in the triangle network, has
been perceived to be particularly fragile, with low robustness to noise in
physical implementations. Here we show to the contrary that nonlocality based
on N00N states already for $N=2$ has an exceptionally high robustness to photon
loss. For the dominant noise factor, single photon loss in the transmission
channels, we can certify noise robustness up to 10\% loss, while for a
realistic noise model we use neural network-based heuristics to observe $\sim
50\%$ robustness. Moreover we show that the robustness holds even for imperfect
sources based on SPDC sources, where the heralding information of the sources
can be used to avoid any global post-processing of the outcomes, such as
discarding rounds when photons fail to arrive, and thus demonstrate how the
detection loophole in the triangle network can be closed.

**Abstract:**
Teleportation, a novel scheme, initially posited by Bennett \textit{et.al},
has been studied here in the context of sending a single qutrit from Alice to
Bob using two qutrit entangled channels as resources. In this paper we have
considered two special two qutrit entangled states, which belong to $SU(3)$
group, as useful resources for teleportation. For the successful teleportation,
these entangled states have been chosen as quantum channels shared between
Alice and Bob. Another entangled basis of two qutrit states have been used as
auxiliary states, which would help Alice to manipulate with her channel so that
the single qutrit she holds can be successfully teleported to Bob. Bob's
choices of measurement operators influence the retrieval of Alice's single
qutrit.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Besides noticeable challenges in implementing low-error single- and two-qubit
quantum gates in superconducting quantum processors, the readout technique and
analysis are a key factor in determining the efficiency and performance of
quantum processors. Being able to efficiently implement quantum algorithms
involving entangling gates and asses their output is mandatory for quantum
utility. In a transmon-based 5-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we
compared the performance of quantum circuits involving an increasing level of
complexity, from single-qubit circuits to maximally entangled Bell circuits.
This comparison highlighted the importance of the readout analysis and helped
us optimize the protocol for more advanced quantum algorithms. Here we report
the results obtained from the analysis of the outputs of quantum circuits using
two readout paradigms, referred to as "multiplied readout probabilities" and
"conditional readout probabilities". The first method is suitable for
single-qubit circuits, while the second is essential for accurately
interpreting the outputs of circuits involving two-qubit gates.

## Quantum algorithms for cooling: a simple case study

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24330v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Preparation of low-energy quantum many-body states has a wide range of
applications in quantum information processing and condensed matter physics.
Quantum cooling algorithms offer a promising alternative to other methods
based, for instance, on variational and adiabatic principles, or on dissipative
state preparation. In this work, we investigate a set of cooling algorithms in
a simple, solvable fermionic model which allows us to identify the mechanisms
which underlie the cooling process and, also, those which prevent it. We derive
analytical expressions for the cooling dynamics, steady states, and cooling
rates in the weak coupling limit. We find that multi-frequency and randomized
cycle strategies can significantly enhance the performance of the quantum
algorithm and circumvent some of the obstacles. We also analyze the effects of
noise and evaluate the conditions under which cooling remains feasible.
Furthermore, we present optimized cooling protocols that can significantly
enhance cooling performance in the presence of noise. Additionally, we compare
cooling and dissipative state preparation and show that, in the model analyzed
here, cooling generally achieves lower energies and is more resilient to noise.

## Spontaneous Emission from Electronic Metastable Resonance States

**Authors:** Amir Sivan, Milan Šindelka, Meir Orenstein, Nimrod Moiseyev
**Categories:** quant-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24338v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We demonstrate that calculating the spontaneous emission decay rate from
metastable resonance states (states with finite lifetimes embedded in the
continuum) requires considering transitions to all continuum states, not just
to lower states. This holds even when the lifetimes of the metastable states
are very long and might be effectively considered as bound states in the
continuum. However, employing complex-scaling transformations, this
computationally prohibitive task becomes feasible by utilizing methods
originally designed for excited bound states for calculation of complex poles
of the scattering matrix. As an illustrative example, these methods are applied
to calculate the spontaneous emission decay rates of metastable resonance
states in a double-barrier potential. The rapid numerical convergence of this
approach highlights a new avenue for studying spontaneous emission from
metastable states in real-life systems, particularly in many-electron systems,
where calculation of the spontaneous emission decay rate from metastable
resonances (e.g., autoionization states) is computationally difficult, if not
impossible, using the standard (Hermitian) formalism of quantum mechanics.

## Entanglement Distribution in Lossy Quantum Networks

**Categories:** quant-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24347v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Entanglement distribution is essential for unlocking the potential of
distributed quantum information processing. We consider an $N$-partite network
where entanglement is distributed via a central source over lossy channels, and
network participants cooperate to establish entanglement between any two chosen
parties under local operations and classical communication (LOCC) constraints.
We develop a general mathematical framework to assess the optimal average
bipartite entanglement shared in a lossy distribution, and introduce a
tractable lower bound by optimizing over a subset of single-parameter LOCC
transformations. Our results show that probabilistically extracting Bell pairs
from W states is more advantageous than deterministically extracting them from
GHZ-like states in lossy networks, with this advantage increasing with network
size. We further extend our analysis analytically, proving that W states remain
more effective in large-scale networks. These findings offer valuable insights
into the practical deployment of near-term networks, revealing a fundamental
trade-off between deterministic entanglement distribution protocols and
loss-sensitive resources.

## Entrywise tensor-train approximation of large tensors via random embeddings

**Authors:** Stanislav Budzinskiy
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.NA, math.PR
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11768v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The theory of low-rank tensor-train approximation is well understood when the
approximation error is measured in the Frobenius norm. The entrywise maximum
norm is equally important but is significantly weaker for large tensors, making
the estimates obtained via the Frobenius norm and norm equivalence pessimistic
or even meaningless. In this article, we derive a direct estimate of the
entrywise approximation error that is applicable in some of these cases. The
estimate is given in terms of the higher-order generalization of the matrix
factorization norm, and its proof is based on the tensor-structured
Hanson--Wright inequality. The theoretical results are accompanied by numerical
experiments carried out with the method of alternating projections.

## Nonlinear orbital stability of stationary discrete shock profiles for scalar conservation laws

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18930v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
For scalar conservation laws, we prove that spectrally stable stationary Lax
discrete shock profiles are nonlinearly stable in some polynomially-weighted
$\ell^1$ and $\ell^\infty$ spaces. In comparison with several previous
nonlinear stability results on discrete shock profiles, we avoid the
introduction of any weakness assumption on the amplitude of the shock and apply
our analysis to a large family of schemes that introduce some artificial
possibly high-order viscosity. The proof relies on a precise description of the
Green's function of the linearization of the numerical scheme about spectrally
stable discrete shock profiles obtained in [Coeu25]. The present article also
pinpoints the ideas for a possible extension of this nonlinear orbital
stability result for discrete shock profiles in the case of systems of
conservation laws.

## On blowup solution in NLS equation under dispersion or nonlinearity management

**Authors:** Jing Li, Cui Ning, Xiaofei Zhao
**Categories:** math.AP, cs.NA, math.NA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23716v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this paper, we study the dispersion-managed nonlinear Schr\"odinger
(DM-NLS) equation $$ i\partial_t u(t,x)+\gamma(t)\Delta
u(t,x)=|u(t,x)|^{\frac4d}u(t,x),\quad x\in\R^d, $$ and the nonlinearity-managed
NLS (NM-NLS) equation: $$ i\partial_t u(t,x)+\Delta
u(t,x)=\gamma(t)|u(t,x)|^{\frac4d}u(t,x), \quad x\in\R^d, $$ where $\gamma(t)$
is a periodic function which is equal to $-1$ when $t\in (0,1]$ and is equal to
$1$ when $t\in (1,2]$. The two models share the feature that the focusing and
defocusing effects convert periodically. For the classical focusing NLS, it is
known that the initial data $$ u_0(x)=T^{-\frac{d}{2}}\fe^{i\frac{|x|^2}{4T}
-i\frac{\omega^2}{T}}Q_\omega\left(\frac{x}{T}\right) $$ leads to a blowup
solution $$(T-t)^{-\frac{d}{2}}\fe^{i\frac{|x|^2}{4(T-t)}
-i\frac{\omega^2}{T-t}}Q_\omega\left(\frac{x}{T-t}\right), $$ so when $T\leq1$,
this is also a blowup solution for DM-NLS and NM-NLS which blows up in the
first focusing layer.
  For DM-NLS, we prove that when $T>1$, the initial data $u_0$ above does not
lead to a finite-time blowup and the corresponding solution is globally
well-posed. For NM-NLS, we prove the global well-posedness for $T\in(1,2)$ and
we construct solution that can blow up at any focusing layer. The theoretical
studies are complemented by extensive numerical explorations towards
understanding the stabilization effects in the two models and addressing their
difference.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24001v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We develop and analyse a finite volume scheme for a nonlocal active matter
system known to exhibit a rich array of complex behaviours. The model under
investigation was derived from a stochastic system of interacting particles
describing a foraging ant colony coupled to pheromone dynamics. In this work,
we prove that the unique numerical solution converges to the unique weak
solution as the mesh size and the time step go to zero. We also show discrete
long-time estimates, which prove that certain norms are preserved for all
times, uniformly in the mesh size and time step. In particular, we prove higher
regularity estimates which provide an analogue of continuum parabolic higher
regularity estimates. Finally, we numerically study the rate of convergence of
the scheme, and we provide examples of the existence of multiple metastable
steady states.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In orthodontic treatment, the biological response of the tooth, periodontal
ligament, and bone complex to orthodontic force is crucial in influencing
treatment outcomes. The challenge lies in accurately measuring, estimating, and
predicting these forces during clinical procedures. This review aims to fill
the gap in the literature by systematically summarizing existing research on
orthodontic force simulation, examining common loading techniques and
technologies, and discussing the potential for refining the orthodontic force
simulation process. The literature was comprehensively reviewed, with an
emphasis on the exploration of the biological mechanism of tooth movement.
Studies were categorized based on force-loading techniques for both fixed and
invisible orthodontic appliances. Finite element (FE) analysis stands out as
the predominant technique for orthodontic force simulation, with a significant
focus on fixed orthodontics but limited emphasis on invisible orthodontics.
Current orthodontic force simulations tend to be fragmented, often considering
only the instantaneous response to applied forces. There exists an urgent
demand for a sophisticated analytical simulation model. Such a model, possibly
leveraging advanced technologies like deep learning, holds the promise of
forecasting orthodontic treatment outcomes with heightened precision and
efficiency.

## Polynomial Inequalities and Optimal Stability of Numerical Integrators

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24232v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
A numerical integrator for $\dot{x}=f(x)$ is called \emph{stable} if, when
applied to the 1D Dahlquist test equation $\dot{x}=\lambda
x,\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$ with fixed timestep $h>0$, the numerical solution
remains bounded as the number of steps tends to infinity. It is well known that
no explicit integrator may remain stable beyond certain limits in $\lambda$.
Furthermore, these stability limits are only tight for certain specific
integrators (different in each case), which may then be called `optimally
stable'. Such optimal stability results are typically proven using
sophisticated techniques from complex analysis, leading to rather abstruse
proofs. In this article, we pursue an alternative approach, exploiting
connections with the Bernstein and Markov brothers inequalities for
polynomials. This simplifies the proofs greatly and offers a framework which
unifies the diverse results that have been obtained.

## Model Selection for Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Structural Risk Minimization

**Authors:** Chendi Qu, Jianping He, Xiaoming Duan, Jiming Chen
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16566v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) usually assumes the reward function
model is pre-specified as a weighted sum of features and estimates the
weighting parameters only. However, how to select features and determine a
proper reward model is nontrivial and experience-dependent. A simplistic model
is less likely to contain the ideal reward function, while a model with high
complexity leads to substantial computation cost and potential overfitting.
This paper addresses this trade-off in the model selection for IRL problems by
introducing the structural risk minimization (SRM) framework from statistical
learning. SRM selects an optimal reward function class from a hypothesis set
minimizing both estimation error and model complexity. To formulate an SRM
scheme for IRL, we estimate the policy gradient from given demonstration as the
empirical risk, and establish the upper bound of Rademacher complexity as the
model penalty of hypothesis function classes. The SRM learning guarantee is
further presented. In particular, we provide the explicit form for the linear
weighted sum setting. Simulations demonstrate the performance and efficiency of
our algorithm.

## Accelerated Smoothing: A Scalable Approach to Randomized Smoothing

**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07498v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Randomized smoothing has emerged as a potent certifiable defense against
adversarial attacks by employing smoothing noises from specific distributions
to ensure the robustness of a smoothed classifier. However, the utilization of
Monte Carlo sampling in this process introduces a compute-intensive element,
which constrains the practicality of randomized smoothing on a larger scale. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that replaces Monte Carlo
sampling with the training of a surrogate neural network. Through extensive
experimentation in various settings, we demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach in approximating the smoothed classifier with remarkable precision.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates the
robust radius certification process, providing nearly $600$X improvement in
computation time, overcoming the computational bottlenecks associated with
traditional randomized smoothing.

## RelChaNet: Neural Network Feature Selection using Relative Change Scores

**Authors:** Felix Zimmer
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02344v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
There is an ongoing effort to develop feature selection algorithms to improve
interpretability, reduce computational resources, and minimize overfitting in
predictive models. Neural networks stand out as architectures on which to build
feature selection methods, and recently, neuron pruning and regrowth have
emerged from the sparse neural network literature as promising new tools. We
introduce RelChaNet, a novel and lightweight supervised feature selection
algorithm that uses neuron pruning and regrowth in the input layer of a dense
neural network. For neuron pruning, a gradient sum metric measures the relative
change induced in a network after a feature enters, while neurons are randomly
regrown. We also propose an extension that adapts the size of the input layer
at runtime. Extensive experiments on 13 different datasets show that our
approach generally outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and in
particular improves the average accuracy by 2% on the MNIST dataset. Our code
is available at https://github.com/flxzimmer/relchanet.

## The AI off-switch problem as a signalling game: bounded rationality and incomparability

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The off-switch problem is a critical challenge in AI control: if an AI system
resists being switched off, it poses a significant risk. In this paper, we
model the off-switch problem as a signalling game, where a human decision-maker
communicates its preferences about some underlying decision problem to an AI
agent, which then selects actions to maximise the human's utility. We assume
that the human is a bounded rational agent and explore various bounded
rationality mechanisms. Using real machine learning models, we reprove prior
results and demonstrate that a necessary condition for an AI system to refrain
from disabling its off-switch is its uncertainty about the human's utility. We
also analyse how message costs influence optimal strategies and extend the
analysis to scenarios involving incomparability.

## Innovative LSGTime Model for Crime Spatiotemporal Prediction Based on MindSpore Framework

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
With the acceleration of urbanization, the spatiotemporal characteristics of
criminal activities have become increasingly complex. Accurate prediction of
crime distribution is crucial for optimizing the allocation of police resources
and preventing crime. This paper proposes LGSTime, a crime spatiotemporal
prediction model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU), and the Multi-head Sparse Self-attention mechanism. LSTM and GRU
capture long-term dependencies in crime time series, such as seasonality and
periodicity, through their unique gating mechanisms. The Multi-head Sparse
Self-attention mechanism, on the other hand, focuses on both temporal and
spatial features of criminal events simultaneously through parallel processing
and sparsification techniques, significantly improving computational efficiency
and prediction accuracy. The integrated model leverages the strengths of each
technique to better handle complex spatiotemporal data. Experimental findings
demonstrate that the model attains optimal performance across four real - world
crime datasets. In comparison to the CNN model, it exhibits performance
enhancements of 2.8\%, 1.9\%, and 1.4\% in the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics respectively.
These results offer a valuable reference for tackling the challenges in crime
prediction.

**Abstract:**
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning
large language models with human preferences. While recent research has focused

been overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven
bottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and
decreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining
reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to
mitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method,
Pre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness.
Additionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in
RLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model
sizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that
RTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth,
and then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid
capture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial
improvements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance
of careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome
performance barriers in RLHF.

## Dynamic Operating System Scheduling Using Double DQN: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Task Optimization

**Authors:** Xiaoxuan Sun, Yifei Duan, Yingnan Deng, Fan Guo, Guohui Cai, Yuting Peng
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23659v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this paper, an operating system scheduling algorithm based on Double DQN
(Double Deep Q network) is proposed, and its performance under different task
types and system loads is verified by experiments. Compared with the
traditional scheduling algorithm, the algorithm based on Double DQN can
dynamically adjust the task priority and resource allocation strategy, thus
improving the task completion efficiency, system throughput, and response
speed. The experimental results show that the Double DQN algorithm has high
scheduling performance under light load, medium load and heavy load scenarios,
especially when dealing with I/O intensive tasks, and can effectively reduce
task completion time and system response time. In addition, the algorithm also
shows high optimization ability in resource utilization and can intelligently
adjust resource allocation according to the system state, avoiding resource
waste and excessive load. Future studies will further explore the application
of the algorithm in more complex systems, especially scheduling optimization in
cloud computing and large-scale distributed environments, combining factors
such as network latency and energy efficiency to improve the overall
performance and adaptability of the algorithm.

## PDSL: Privacy-Preserved Decentralized Stochastic Learning with Heterogeneous Data Distribution

**Authors:** Lina Wang, Yunsheng Yuan, Chunxiao Wang, Feng Li
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23726v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In the paradigm of decentralized learning, a group of agents collaborates to
learn a global model using distributed datasets without a central server.
However, due to the heterogeneity of the local data across the different
agents, learning a robust global model is rather challenging. Moreover, the
collaboration of the agents relies on their gradient information exchange,
which poses a risk of privacy leakage. In this paper, to address these issues,
we propose PDSL, a novel privacy-preserved decentralized stochastic learning
algorithm with heterogeneous data distribution. On one hand, we innovate in
utilizing the notion of Shapley values such that each agent can precisely
measure the contributions of its heterogeneous neighbors to the global learning
goal; on the other hand, we leverage the notion of differential privacy to
prevent each agent from suffering privacy leakage when it contributes gradient
information to its neighbors. We conduct both solid theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our PDSL algorithm in
terms of privacy preservation and convergence.

## Time-Series Forecasting via Topological Information Supervised Framework with Efficient Topological Feature Learning

**Authors:** ZiXin Lin, Nur Fariha Syaqina Zulkepli
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23757v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting
meaningful features from complex data structures, driving significant
advancements in fields such as neuroscience, biology, machine learning, and
financial modeling. Despite its success, the integration of TDA with
time-series prediction remains underexplored due to three primary challenges:
the limited utilization of temporal dependencies within topological features,
computational bottlenecks associated with persistent homology, and the
deterministic nature of TDA pipelines restricting generalized feature learning.
This study addresses these challenges by proposing the Topological Information
Supervised (TIS) Prediction framework, which leverages neural networks and
Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to generate synthetic
topological features, preserving their distribution while significantly
reducing computational time. We propose a novel training strategy that
integrates topological consistency loss to improve the predictive accuracy of
deep learning models. Specifically, we introduce two state-of-the-art models,
TIS-BiGRU and TIS-Informer, designed to capture short-term and long-term
temporal dependencies, respectively. Comparative experimental results
demonstrate the superior performance of TIS models over conventional
predictors, validating the effectiveness of integrating topological
information. This work not only advances TDA-based time-series prediction but
also opens new avenues for utilizing topological features in deep learning
architectures.

## Accelerating High-Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Discovery via Pretrained Graph Neural Networks and Generative Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Jiangjie Qiu, Hou Hei Lam, Xiuyuan Hu, Wentao Li, Siwei Fu, Fankun Zeng, Hao Zhang, Xiaonan Wang
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23766v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials offer a promising avenue toward
cost-effective solar energy utilization. However, optimizing donor-acceptor
(D-A) combinations to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates
large-scale pretraining of graph neural networks (GNNs) with a GPT-2
(Generative Pretrained Transformer 2)-based reinforcement learning (RL)
strategy to design OPV molecules with potentially high PCE. This approach
produces candidate molecules with predicted efficiencies approaching 21\%,
although further experimental validation is required. Moreover, we conducted a
preliminary fragment-level analysis to identify structural motifs recognized by
the RL model that may contribute to enhanced PCE, thus providing design
guidelines for the broader research community. To facilitate continued
discovery, we are building the largest open-source OPV dataset to date,
expected to include nearly 3,000 donor-acceptor pairs. Finally, we discuss
plans to collaborate with experimental teams on synthesizing and characterizing
AI-designed molecules, which will provide new data to refine and improve our
predictive and generative models.

## An extension of linear self-attention for in-context learning

**Authors:** Katsuyuki Hagiwara
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23814v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In-context learning is a remarkable property of transformers and has been the
focus of recent research. An attention mechanism is a key component in
transformers, in which an attention matrix encodes relationships between words
in a sentence and is used as weights for words in a sentence. This mechanism is
effective for capturing language representations. However, it is questionable
whether naive self-attention is suitable for in-context learning in general
tasks, since the computation implemented by self-attention is somewhat
restrictive in terms of matrix multiplication. In fact, we may need appropriate
input form designs when considering heuristic implementations of computational
algorithms. In this paper, in case of linear self-attention, we extend it by
introducing a bias matrix in addition to a weight matrix for an input. Despite
the simple extension, the extended linear self-attention can output any
constant matrix, input matrix and multiplications of two or three matrices in
the input. Note that the second property implies that it can be a skip
connection. Therefore, flexible matrix manipulations can be implemented by
connecting the extended linear self-attention components. As an example of
implementation using the extended linear self-attention, we show a heuristic
construction of a batch-type gradient descent of ridge regression under a
reasonable input form.

## Node Embeddings via Neighbor Embeddings

**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23822v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Graph layouts and node embeddings are two distinct paradigms for
non-parametric graph representation learning. In the former, nodes are embedded
into 2D space for visualization purposes. In the latter, nodes are embedded
into a high-dimensional vector space for downstream processing.
State-of-the-art algorithms for these two paradigms, force-directed layouts and
random-walk-based contrastive learning (such as DeepWalk and node2vec), have
little in common. In this work, we show that both paradigms can be approached
with a single coherent framework based on established neighbor embedding
methods. Specifically, we introduce graph t-SNE, a neighbor embedding method
for two-dimensional graph layouts, and graph CNE, a contrastive neighbor
embedding method that produces high-dimensional node representations by
optimizing the InfoNCE objective. We show that both graph t-SNE and graph CNE
strongly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of local structure
preservation, while being conceptually simpler.

## Communication-Efficient and Personalized Federated Foundation Model Fine-Tuning via Tri-Matrix Adaptation

**Authors:** Yongle Li, Bo Liu, Sheng Huang, ZHeng ZHang, Xiaotong Yuan, Richang Hong
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23869v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In federated learning, fine-tuning pre-trained foundation models poses
significant challenges, particularly regarding high communication cost and
suboptimal model performance due to data heterogeneity between the clients. To
address these issues, this paper introduces communication-efficient federated
LoRA adaption (CE-LoRA), a method that employs a tri-factorization low-rank
adaptation approach with personalized model parameter aggregation. We first
presents a novel LoRA parameter factorization by introducing a small-size dense
matrix, which can significantly reduce the communication cost and achieve
comparable empirical performance than transferring the low-rank parameter
matrix used by existing methods. Without violating data privacy, the server
considers the client similarity in both training dataset and model parameter
space, and learns personalized weights for model aggregation. Our experiments
on various LLM and VLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that CE-LoRA not only
significantly reduces communication overhead but also improves performance
under not independently and identically distributed data conditions. In
addition, CE-LoRA improves data privacy protection, effectively mitigating
gradient-based data reconstruction attacks.

## An End-to-End Comprehensive Gear Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Multi-Scale Feature-Level Fusion Strategy

**Authors:** Bowei Qiao, Hongwei Wang
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23887v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
To satisfy the requirements of the end-to-end fault diagnosis of gears, an
integrated intelligent method of fault diagnosis for gears using acceleration
signals was proposed, which was based on Gabor-based Adaptive Short-Time
Fourier Transform (Gabor-ASTFT) and Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform(DTCWT)
algorithms, Dilated Residual structure and feature fusion layer, is proposed in
this paper. Initially, the raw one-dimensional acceleration signals collected
from the gearbox base using vibration sensors undergo pre-segmentation
processing. The Gabor-ASTFT and DTCWT are then applied to convert the original
one-dimensional time-domain signals into two-dimensional time-frequency
representations, facilitating the preliminary extraction of fault features and
obtaining weak feature maps.Subsequently, a dual-channel structure is
established using deconvolution and dilated convolution to perform upsampling
and downsampling on the feature maps, adjusting their sizes accordingly. A
feature fusion layer is then constructed to integrate the dual-channel
features, enabling multi-scale analysis of the extracted fault
features.Finally, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model incorporating a
residual structure is developed to conduct deep feature extraction from the
fused feature maps. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a Global
Average Pooling(GAP) and a classification function for fault classification.
Conducting comparative experiments on different datasets, the proposed method
is demonstrated to effectively meet the requirements of end-to-end fault
diagnosis for gears.

**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24043v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
To enhance the accuracy and robustness of PM$_{2.5}$ concentration
forecasting, this paper introduces FALNet, a Frequency-Aware LSTM Network that
integrates frequency-domain decomposition, temporal modeling, and
attention-based refinement. The model first applies STL and FFT to extract
trend, seasonal, and denoised residual components, effectively filtering out
high-frequency noise. The filtered residuals are then fed into a stacked LSTM
to capture long-term dependencies, followed by a multi-head attention mechanism
that dynamically focuses on key time steps. Experiments conducted on real-world
urban air quality datasets demonstrate that FALNet consistently outperforms
conventional models across standard metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. The
model shows strong adaptability in capturing sharp fluctuations during
pollution peaks and non-stationary conditions. These results validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of FALNet for real-time air pollution
prediction, environmental risk assessment, and decision-making support.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24067v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Transformers are the cornerstone of modern large language models, but their
quadratic computational complexity limits efficiency in long-sequence
processing. Recent advancements in Mamba, a state space model (SSM) with linear
complexity, offer promising efficiency gains but suffer from unstable
contextual learning and multitask generalization. This paper proposes
TransMamba, a novel framework that unifies Transformer and Mamba through shared
parameter matrices (e.g., QKV and CBx), and thus could dynamically switch
between attention and SSM mechanisms at different token lengths and layers. We
design the Memory converter to bridge Transformer and Mamba by converting
attention outputs into SSM-compatible states, ensuring seamless information
flow at TransPoints where the transformation happens. The TransPoint scheduling
is also thoroughly explored for further improvements. We conducted extensive
experiments demonstrating that TransMamba achieves superior training efficiency
and performance compared to baselines, and validated the deeper consistency
between Transformer and Mamba paradigms, offering a scalable solution for
next-generation sequence modeling.

## Level the Level: Balancing Game Levels for Asymmetric Player Archetypes With Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Florian Rupp, Kai Eckert
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24099v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Balancing games, especially those with asymmetric multiplayer content,
requires significant manual effort and extensive human playtesting during
development. For this reason, this work focuses on generating balanced levels
tailored to asymmetric player archetypes, where the disparity in abilities is
balanced entirely through the level design. For instance, while one archetype
may have an advantage over another, both should have an equal chance of
winning. We therefore conceptualize game balancing as a procedural content
generation problem and build on and extend a recently introduced method that
uses reinforcement learning to balance tile-based game levels. We evaluate the
method on four different player archetypes and demonstrate its ability to
balance a larger proportion of levels compared to two baseline approaches.
Furthermore, our results indicate that as the disparity between player
archetypes increases, the required number of training steps grows, while the
model's accuracy in achieving balance decreases.

## CTSketch: Compositional Tensor Sketching for Scalable Neurosymbolic Learning

**Authors:** Seewon Choi, Alaia Solko-Breslin, Rajeev Alur, Eric Wong
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24123v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Many computational tasks benefit from being formulated as the composition of
neural networks followed by a discrete symbolic program. The goal of
neurosymbolic learning is to train the neural networks using only end-to-end
input-output labels of the composite. We introduce CTSketch, a novel, scalable
neurosymbolic learning algorithm. CTSketch uses two techniques to improve the
scalability of neurosymbolic inference: decompose the symbolic program into
sub-programs and summarize each sub-program with a sketched tensor. This
strategy allows us to approximate the output distribution of the program with
simple tensor operations over the input distributions and summaries. We provide
theoretical insight into the maximum error of the approximation. Furthermore,
we evaluate CTSketch on many benchmarks from the neurosymbolic literature,
including some designed for evaluating scalability. Our results show that
CTSketch pushes neurosymbolic learning to new scales that have previously been
unattainable by obtaining high accuracy on tasks involving over one thousand
inputs.

## LLM4FS: Leveraging Large Language Models for Feature Selection and How to Improve It

**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24157v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have provided new
opportunities for decision-making, particularly in the task of automated
feature selection. In this paper, we first comprehensively evaluate LLM-based
feature selection methods, covering the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1,
GPT-o3-mini, and GPT-4.5. Then, we propose a novel hybrid strategy called
LLM4FS that integrates LLMs with traditional data-driven methods. Specifically,
input data samples into LLMs, and directly call traditional data-driven
techniques such as random forest and forward sequential selection. Notably, our
analysis reveals that the hybrid strategy leverages the contextual
understanding of LLMs and the high statistical reliability of traditional
data-driven methods to achieve excellent feature selection performance, even
surpassing LLMs and traditional data-driven methods. Finally, we point out the
limitations of its application in decision-making.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this paper, we introduce NeuRaLaTeX, which we believe to be the first deep
learning library written entirely in LaTeX. As part of your LaTeX document you
can specify the architecture of a neural network and its loss functions, define
how to generate or load training data, and specify training hyperparameters and
experiments. When the document is compiled, the LaTeX compiler will generate or
load training data, train the network, run experiments, and generate figures.
This paper generates a random 100 point spiral dataset, trains a two layer MLP
on it, evaluates on a different random spiral dataset, produces plots and
tables of results. The paper took 48 hours to compile and the entire source
code for NeuRaLaTeX is contained within the source code of the paper. We
propose two new metrics: the Written In Latex (WIL) metric measures the
proportion of a machine learning library that is written in pure LaTeX, while
the Source Code Of Method in Source Code of Paper (SCOMISCOP) metric measures
the proportion of a paper's implementation that is contained within the paper
source. We are state-of-the-art for both metrics, outperforming the ResNet and
Transformer papers, as well as the PyTorch and Tensorflow libraries. Source

commercialisation of NeuRaLaTeX are available at https://www.neuralatex.com

## Many-to-Many Matching via Sparsity Controlled Optimal Transport

**Authors:** Weijie Liu, Han Bao, Makoto Yamada, Zenan Huang, Nenggan Zheng, Hui Qian
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24204v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Many-to-many matching seeks to match multiple points in one set and multiple
points in another set, which is a basis for a wide range of data mining
problems. It can be naturally recast in the framework of Optimal Transport
(OT). However, existing OT methods either lack the ability to accomplish
many-to-many matching or necessitate careful tuning of a regularization
parameter to achieve satisfactory results. This paper proposes a novel
many-to-many matching method to explicitly encode many-to-many constraints
while preventing the degeneration into one-to-one matching. The proposed method
consists of the following two components. The first component is the matching
budget constraints on each row and column of a transport plan, which specify
how many points can be matched to a point at most. The second component is the
deformed $q$-entropy regularization, which encourages a point to meet the
matching budget maximally. While the deformed $q$-entropy was initially
proposed to sparsify a transport plan, we employ it to avoid the degeneration
into one-to-one matching. We optimize the objective via a penalty algorithm,
which is efficient and theoretically guaranteed to converge. Experimental
results on various tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good
performance by gleaning meaningful many-to-many matchings.

## Advances in Continual Graph Learning for Anti-Money Laundering Systems: A Comprehensive Review

**Authors:** Bruno Deprez, Wei Wei, Wouter Verbeke, Bart Baesens, Kevin Mets, Tim Verdonck
**Categories:** cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24259v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Financial institutions are required by regulation to report suspicious
financial transactions related to money laundering. Therefore, they need to
constantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. A
particular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers
continuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods
need constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from
catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby
limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning
methods may address this issue and enhance current anti-money laundering (AML)
practices, by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining
prior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is
still scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual
graph learning approaches for AML applications. We categorise methods into
replay-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based strategies within
the graph neural network (GNN) framework, and we provide in-depth experimental
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world AML data sets that showcase the
effect of the different hyperparameters. Our analysis demonstrates that
continual learning improves model adaptability and robustness in the face of
extreme class imbalances and evolving fraud patterns. Finally, we outline key
challenges and propose directions for future research.

## Adjoint-based optimization of the Rayleigh-Bénard instability with melting boundary

**Authors:** Tomas Fullana, Alejandro Quirós Rodríguez, Vincent Le Chenadec, Taraneh Sayadi

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23831v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this work, we propose an adjoint-based optimization procedure to control
the onset of the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability with a melting front. A novel
cut cell method is used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq
approximation and the convection-diffusion equation in the fluid layer, as well
as the heat equation in the solid phase. To track the interface we use the
level set method where its evolution is simply governed by an advection
equation. An incomplete continuous adjoint problem is then derived by
considering that the velocity field is a check-pointing variable. The results
of the minimization problem with a tracking-type cost-functional show that our
adjoint method is well suited to optimize the shapes of the fronts in this
configuration.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24294v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Soft solids with surface energy exhibit complex mechanical behavior,
necessitating advanced constitutive models to capture the interplay between
bulk and surface mechanics. This interplay has profound implications for
material design and emerging technologies. In this work, we set up variational
models for bulk-surface elasticity and explore a novel class of
surface-polyconvex constitutive models that account for surface energy while
ensuring the existence of minimizers. These models are implemented within a
finite element framework and validated through benchmark problems and
applications, including, e.g., the liquid bridge problem and the
Rayleigh-Plateau instability, for which the surface energy plays the dominant
role. The results demonstrate the ability of surface-polyconvex models to
accurately capture surface-driven phenomena, establishing them as a powerful
tool for advancing the mechanics of soft materials in both engineering and
biological applications.

## General Distribution Steering: A Sub-Optimal Solution by Convex Optimization

**Categories:** math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06227v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
General distribution steering is intrinsically an infinite-dimensional
problem, when the continuous distributions to steer are arbitrary. We put
forward a moment representation of the primal system for control in [42].
However, the system trajectory was a predetermined one without optimization
towards a design criterion, which doesn't always ensure a most satisfactory
solution. In this paper, we propose an optimization approach to the general
distribution steering problem of the first-order discrete-time linear system,
i.e., an optimal control law for the corresponding moment system. The domain of
all feasible control inputs is non-convex and has a complex topology. We obtain
a subset of it by minimizing a weighted sum of squared integral distances
alongside the system trajectory. The feasible domain is then proved convex, and
the optimal control problem can be treated as a convex optimization or by
exhaustive search, based on the type of the cost function. Algorithms of
steering for continuous and discrete distributions are then put forward
respectively, by adopting a realization scheme of control inputs. We also
provide an explicit advantage of our proposed algorithm by truncated power
moments to the prevailing Gaussian Mixture Models. Experiments on different
types of cost functions are given to validate the performance of our proposed
algorithm. Since the moment system is a dimension-reduced counterpart of the
primal system, we call this solution a sub-optimal one to the primal general
distribution steering problem.

## Feasibility Evaluation of Quadratic Programs for Constrained Control

**Authors:** Panagiotis Rousseas, Dimitra Panagou
**Categories:** math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12005v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This paper presents a computationally-efficient method for evaluating the
feasibility of Quadratic Programs (QPs) for online constrained control. Based
on the duality principle, we first show that the feasibility of a QP can be
determined by the solution of a properly-defined Linear Program (LP). Our
analysis yields a LP that can be solved more efficiently compared to the
original QP problem, and more importantly, is simpler in form and can be solved
more efficiently compared to existing methods that assess feasibility via LPs.
The computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing
methods for feasibility evaluation is demonstrated in comparative case studies
as well as a feasible-constraint selection problem, indicating its promise for
online feasibility evaluation of optimization-based controllers.

## Distributionally Robust Model Order Reduction for Linear Systems

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this paper, we investigate distributionally robust model order reduction
for linear, discrete-time, time-invariant systems. The external input is
assumed to follow an uncertain distribution within a Wasserstein ambiguity set.
We begin by considering the case where the distribution is certain and
formulate an optimization problem to obtain the reduced model. When the
distribution is uncertain, the interaction between the reduced-order model and
the distribution is modeled by a Stackelberg game. To ensure solvability, we
first introduce the Gelbrich distance and demonstrate that the Stackelberg game
within a Wasserstein ambiguity set is equivalent to that within a Gelbrich
ambiguity set. Then, we propose a nested optimization problem to solve the
Stackelberg game. Furthermore, the nested optimization problem is relaxed into
a nested convex optimization problem, ensuring computational feasibility.
Finally, a simulation is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24025v1

**Abstract:**
We show how graphons can be used to model and analyze open multi-agent
systems, which are multi-agent systems subject to arrivals and departures, in
the specific case of linear consensus. First, we analyze the case of
replacements, where under the assumption of a deterministic interval between
two replacements, we derive an upper bound for the disagreement in expectation.
Then, we study the case of arrivals and departures, where we define a process
for the evolution of the number of agents that guarantees a minimum and a
maximum number of agents. Next, we derive an upper bound for the disagreement
in expectation, and we establish a link with the spectrum of the expected graph
used to generate the graph topologies. Finally, for stochastic block model
(SBM) graphons, we prove that the computation of the spectrum of the expected
graph can be performed based on a matrix whose dimension depends only on the
graphon and it is independent of the number of agents.

## An ANN-Enhanced Approach for Flatness-Based Constrained Control of Nonlinear Systems

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24031v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Neural networks have proven practical for a synergistic combination of
advanced control techniques. This work analyzes the implementation of rectified
linear unit neural networks to achieve constrained control in differentially
flat systems. Specifically, the class of flat systems enjoys the benefit of
feedback linearizability, i.e., the systems can be linearized by means of a
proper variable transformation. However, the price for linearizing the dynamics
is that the constraint descriptions are distorted geometrically. Our results
show that, by using neural networks, these constraints can be represented as a
union of polytopes, enabling the use of mixed-integer programming tools to
guarantee constraint satisfaction. We further analyze the integration of the
characterization into efficient settings such as control Lyapunov
function-based and model predictive control (MPC). Interestingly, this
description also allows us to explicitly compute the solution of the MPC
problem for the nonlinear system. Several examples are provided to illustrate
the effectiveness of our framework.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24086v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a novel distributed optimization framework for
large-scale AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, offering both theoretical
convergence guarantees and rapid convergence in practice. By integrating
smoothing techniques and the Schur complement, the proposed approach addresses
the scalability challenges and reduces communication overhead in distributed AC
OPF. Additionally, optimal network decomposition enables efficient parallel
processing under the single program multiple data (SPMD) paradigm. Extensive
simulations on large-scale benchmarks across various operating scenarios
indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art
centralized solver IPOPT on modest hardware. This paves the way for more
scalable and efficient distributed optimization in future power system
applications.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
A road heating system is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by
burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground. When integrating road
heating into the power distribution system, we need to optimize the flow of
electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and
conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we extend the power
distribution system considered in the authors' previous study to the case where
battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive
switching control that achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation
of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify
the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical
simulation.

## Robust Feedback Optimization with Model Uncertainty: A Regularization Approach

**Authors:** Winnie Chan, Zhiyu He, Keith Moffat, Saverio Bolognani, Michael Muehlebach, Florian Dörfler

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24151v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Feedback optimization optimizes the steady state of a dynamical system by
implementing optimization iterations in closed loop with the plant. It relies
on online measurements and limited model information, namely, the input-output
sensitivity. In practice, various issues including inaccurate modeling, lack of
observation, or changing conditions can lead to sensitivity mismatches, causing
closed-loop sub-optimality or even instability. To handle such uncertainties,
we pursue robust feedback optimization, where we optimize the closed-loop
performance against all possible sensitivities lying in specific uncertainty
sets. We provide tractable reformulations for the corresponding min-max
problems via regularizations and characterize the online closed-loop
performance through the tracking error in case of time-varying optimal
solutions. Simulations on a distribution grid illustrate the effectiveness of
our robust feedback optimization controller in addressing sensitivity
mismatches in a non-stationary environment.

## A system level approach to generalised feedback Nash equilibrium seeking in partially-observed games

**Authors:** Otacilio B. L. Neto, Michela Mulas, Francesco Corona
**Categories:** math.OC, cs.SY, eess.SY
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24159v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This work proposes an algorithm for seeking generalised feedback Nash
equilibria (GFNE) in noncooperative dynamic games. The focus is on
cyber-physical systems with dynamics which are linear, stochastic, potentially
unstable, and partially observed. We employ System Level Synthesis (SLS) to
reformulate the problem as the search for an equilibrium profile of closed-loop
responses to noise, which can then be used to reconstruct a stabilising
output-feedback policy. Under this setup, we leverage monotone operator theory
to design a GFNE-seeking algorithm capable to enforce closed-loop stability,
operational constraints, and communication constraints onto the control
policies. This algorithm is amenable to numerical implementation and we provide
conditions for its convergence. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated
experiment on the noncooperative stabilisation of a decentralised power-grid.

## Enhancing Object Coherence in Layout-to-Image Synthesis

**Authors:** Yibin Wang, Changhai Zhou, Honghui Xu
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10522v7
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Layout-to-image synthesis is an emerging technique in conditional image
generation. It aims to generate complex scenes, where users require fine
control over the layout of the objects in a scene. However, it remains
challenging to control the object coherence, including semantic coherence
(e.g., the cat looks at the flowers or not) and physical coherence (e.g., the
hand and the racket should not be misaligned). In this paper, we propose a
novel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and
self-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for
this task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains
rich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in
the images. Instead of simply employing cross-attention between captions and
latent images, which addresses the highly relevant layout restriction and
semantic coherence requirement separately and thus leads to unsatisfying
results shown in our experiments, we develop GSF to fuse the supervision from
the layout restriction and semantic coherence requirement and exploit it to
guide the image synthesis process. Moreover, to improve the physical coherence,
we develop a Self-similarity Coherence Attention (SCA) module to explicitly
integrate local contextual physical coherence relation into each pixel's
generation process. Specifically, we adopt a self-similarity map to encode the
physical coherence restrictions and employ it to extract coherent features from
text embedding. Through visualization of our self-similarity map, we explore
the essence of SCA, revealing that its effectiveness is not only in capturing
reliable physical coherence patterns but also in enhancing complex texture
generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed
method.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11067v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The primary objective of methods in continual learning is to learn tasks in a
sequential manner over time (sometimes from a stream of data), while mitigating
the detrimental phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. This paper proposes a
method to learn an effective representation between previous and newly
encountered class prototypes. We propose a prototypical network with a Bayesian
learning-driven contrastive loss (BLCL), tailored specifically for
class-incremental learning scenarios. We introduce a contrastive loss that
incorporates novel classes into the latent representation by reducing
intra-class and increasing inter-class distance. Our approach dynamically
adapts the balance between the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions
with a Bayesian learning technique. Experimental results conducted on the
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet100 datasets for image classification and
images of a GNSS-based dataset for interference classification validate the
efficacy of our method, showcasing its superiority over existing
state-of-the-art approaches. Git:

## VeriSplit: Secure and Practical Offloading of Machine Learning Inferences across IoT Devices

**Authors:** Han Zhang, Zifan Wang, Mihir Dhamankar, Matt Fredrikson, Yuvraj Agarwal
**Categories:** cs.CR, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00586v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Many Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices rely on cloud computation resources to
perform machine learning inferences. This is expensive and may raise privacy
concerns for users. Consumers of these devices often have hardware such as
gaming consoles and PCs with graphics accelerators that are capable of
performing these computations, which may be left idle for significant periods
of time. While this presents a compelling potential alternative to cloud
offloading, concerns about the integrity of inferences, the confidentiality of
model parameters, and the privacy of users' data mean that device vendors may
be hesitant to offload their inferences to a platform managed by another
manufacturer.
  We propose VeriSplit, a framework for offloading machine learning inferences
to locally-available devices that address these concerns. We introduce masking
techniques to protect data privacy and model confidentiality, and a
commitment-based verification protocol to address integrity. Unlike much prior
work aimed at addressing these issues, our approach does not rely on
computation over finite field elements, which may interfere with floating-point
computation supports on hardware accelerators and require modification to
existing models. We implemented a prototype of VeriSplit and our evaluation
results show that, compared to performing computation locally, our secure and
private offloading solution can reduce inference latency by 28%--83%.

**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13155v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this paper, we present Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a novel
architecture that integrates the learnable spline-based activation functions of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into convolutional layers. By replacing
traditional fixed-weight kernels with learnable non-linear functions,
Convolutional KANs offer a significant improvement in parameter efficiency and
expressive power over standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We
empirically evaluate Convolutional KANs on the Fashion-MNIST dataset,
demonstrating competitive accuracy with up to 50% fewer parameters compared to
baseline classic convolutions. This suggests that the KAN Convolution can
effectively capture complex spatial relationships with fewer resources,
offering a promising alternative for parameter-efficient deep learning models.

## MAQA: Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification in LLMs Regarding Data Uncertainty

**Authors:** Yongjin Yang, Haneul Yoo, Hwaran Lee
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06816v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Despite the massive advancements in large language models (LLMs), they still
suffer from producing plausible but incorrect responses. To improve the
reliability of LLMs, recent research has focused on uncertainty quantification
to predict whether a response is correct or not. However, most uncertainty
quantification methods have been evaluated on single-labeled questions, which
removes data uncertainty: the irreducible randomness often present in user
queries, which can arise from factors like multiple possible answers. This
limitation may cause uncertainty quantification results to be unreliable in
practical settings. In this paper, we investigate previous uncertainty
quantification methods under the presence of data uncertainty. Our
contributions are two-fold: 1) proposing a new Multi-Answer Question Answering
dataset, MAQA, consisting of world knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and
commonsense reasoning tasks to evaluate uncertainty quantification regarding
data uncertainty, and 2) assessing 5 uncertainty quantification methods of
diverse white- and black-box LLMs. Our findings show that previous methods
relatively struggle compared to single-answer settings, though this varies
depending on the task. Moreover, we observe that entropy- and consistency-based
methods effectively estimate model uncertainty, even in the presence of data
uncertainty. We believe these observations will guide future work on
uncertainty quantification in more realistic settings.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Aerial Remote Sensing (ARS) vision tasks pose significant challenges due to
the unique characteristics of their viewing angles. Existing research has
primarily focused on algorithms for specific tasks, which have limited
applicability in a broad range of ARS vision applications. This paper proposes
the RingMo-Aerial model, aiming to fill the gap in foundation model research in
the field of ARS vision. By introducing the Frequency-Enhanced Multi-Head
Self-Attention (FE-MSA) mechanism and an affine transformation-based
contrastive learning pre-training method, the model's detection capability for
small targets is enhanced and optimized for the tilted viewing angles
characteristic of ARS. Furthermore, the ARS-Adapter, an efficient parameter
fine-tuning method, is proposed to improve the model's adaptability and
effectiveness in various ARS vision tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that RingMo-Aerial achieves SOTA performance on multiple downstream tasks. This
indicates the practicality and efficacy of RingMo-Aerial in enhancing the
performance of ARS vision tasks.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Augmented Reality (AR) assistance is increasingly used for supporting users
with physical tasks like assembly and cooking. However, most systems rely on
reactive responses triggered by user input, overlooking rich contextual and
user-specific information. To address this, we present Satori, a novel AR
system that proactively guides users by modeling both -- their mental states
and environmental contexts. Satori integrates the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI)
framework with the state-of-the-art multi-modal large language model (LLM) to
deliver contextually appropriate guidance. Our system is designed based on two
formative studies involving twelve experts. We evaluated the system with a
sixteen within-subject study and found that Satori matches the performance of
designer-created Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) systems, without manual configurations or
heuristics, thereby improving generalizability, reusability, and expanding the
potential of AR assistance.

## Emphasizing Discriminative Features for Dataset Distillation in Complex Scenarios

**Authors:** Kai Wang, Zekai Li, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Samir Khaki, Ahmad Sajedi, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Konstantinos N Plataniotis, Alexander Hauptmann, Yang You
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17193v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Dataset distillation has demonstrated strong performance on simple datasets
like CIFAR, MNIST, and TinyImageNet but struggles to achieve similar results in
more complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose EDF (emphasizes the
discriminative features), a dataset distillation method that enhances key
discriminative regions in synthetic images using Grad-CAM activation maps. Our
approach is inspired by a key observation: in simple datasets, high-activation
areas typically occupy most of the image, whereas in complex scenarios, the
size of these areas is much smaller. Unlike previous methods that treat all
pixels equally when synthesizing images, EDF uses Grad-CAM activation maps to
enhance high-activation areas. From a supervision perspective, we downplay
supervision signals that have lower losses, as they contain common patterns.
Additionally, to help the DD community better explore complex scenarios, we
build the Complex Dataset Distillation (Comp-DD) benchmark by meticulously
selecting sixteen subsets, eight easy and eight hard, from ImageNet-1K. In
particular, EDF consistently outperforms SOTA results in complex scenarios,
such as ImageNet-1K subsets. Hopefully, more researchers will be inspired and
encouraged to improve the practicality and efficacy of DD. Our code and
benchmark will be made public at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/EDF.

## Singular Value Scaling: Efficient Generative Model Compression via Pruned Weights Refinement

**Authors:** Hyeonjin Kim, Jaejun Yoo
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17387v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
While pruning methods effectively maintain model performance without extra
training costs, they often focus solely on preserving crucial connections,
overlooking the impact of pruned weights on subsequent fine-tuning or
distillation, leading to inefficiencies. Moreover, most compression techniques
for generative models have been developed primarily for GANs, tailored to
specific architectures like StyleGAN, and research into compressing Diffusion
models has just begun. Even more, these methods are often applicable only to
GANs or Diffusion models, highlighting the need for approaches that work across
both model types. In this paper, we introduce Singular Value Scaling (SVS), a
versatile technique for refining pruned weights, applicable to both model
types. Our analysis reveals that pruned weights often exhibit dominant singular
vectors, hindering fine-tuning efficiency and leading to suboptimal performance
compared to random initialization. Our method enhances weight initialization by
minimizing the disparities between singular values of pruned weights, thereby
improving the fine-tuning process. This approach not only guides the compressed
model toward superior solutions but also significantly speeds up fine-tuning.
Extensive experiments on StyleGAN2, StyleGAN3 and DDPM demonstrate that SVS
improves compression performance across model types without additional training
costs. Our code is available at:

## LangYa: Revolutionizing Cross-Spatiotemporal Ocean Forecasting

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18097v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Ocean forecasting is crucial for both scientific research and societal
benefits. Currently, the most accurate forecasting systems are global ocean
forecasting systems (GOFSs), which represent the ocean state variables (OSVs)
as discrete grids and solve partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the
transitions of oceanic state variables using numerical methods. However, GOFSs
processes are computationally expensive and prone to cumulative errors.
Recently, large artificial intelligence (AI)-based models significantly boosted
forecasting speed and accuracy. Unfortunately, building a large AI ocean
forecasting system that can be considered cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea
coupled forecasts remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce LangYa, a
cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea coupled ocean forecasting system. Results
demonstrate that the time embedding module in LangYa enables a single model to
make forecasts with lead times ranging from 1 to 7 days. The air-sea coupled
module effectively simulates air-sea interactions. The ocean self-attention
module improves network stability and accelerates convergence during training,
and the adaptive thermocline loss function improves the accuracy of thermocline
forecasting. Compared to existing numerical and AI-based ocean forecasting
systems, LangYa uses 27 years of global ocean data from the Global Ocean
Reanalysis and Simulation version 12 (GLORYS12) for training and achieves more
reliable deterministic forecasting results for OSVs. LangYa forecasting system
provides global ocean researchers with access to a powerful software tool for
accurate ocean forecasting and opens a new paradigm for ocean science.

## CL-Attack: Textual Backdoor Attacks via Cross-Lingual Triggers

**Authors:** Jingyi Zheng, Tianyi Hu, Tianshuo Cong, Xinlei He
**Categories:** cs.CR, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19037v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Backdoor attacks significantly compromise the security of large language
models by triggering them to output specific and controlled content. Currently,
triggers for textual backdoor attacks fall into two categories: fixed-token
triggers and sentence-pattern triggers. However, the former are typically easy
to identify and filter, while the latter, such as syntax and style, do not
apply to all original samples and may lead to semantic shifts. In this paper,
inspired by cross-lingual (CL) prompts of LLMs in real-world scenarios, we
propose a higher-dimensional trigger method at the paragraph level, namely
CL-attack. CL-attack injects the backdoor by using texts with specific
structures that incorporate multiple languages, thereby offering greater
stealthiness and universality compared to existing backdoor attack techniques.
Extensive experiments on different tasks and model architectures demonstrate
that CL-attack can achieve nearly 100% attack success rate with a low poisoning
rate in both classification and generation tasks. We also empirically show that
the CL-attack is more robust against current major defense methods compared to
baseline backdoor attacks. Additionally, to mitigate CL-attack, we further
develop a new defense called TranslateDefense, which can partially mitigate the
impact of CL-attack.

## Finer-CAM: Spotting the Difference Reveals Finer Details for Visual Explanation

**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11309v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Class activation map (CAM) has been widely used to highlight image regions
that contribute to class predictions. Despite its simplicity and computational
efficiency, CAM often struggles to identify discriminative regions that
distinguish visually similar fine-grained classes. Prior efforts address this
limitation by introducing more sophisticated explanation processes, but at the
cost of extra complexity. In this paper, we propose Finer-CAM, a method that
retains CAM's efficiency while achieving precise localization of discriminative
regions. Our key insight is that the deficiency of CAM lies not in "how" it
explains, but in "what" it explains. Specifically, previous methods attempt to
identify all cues contributing to the target class's logit value, which
inadvertently also activates regions predictive of visually similar classes. By
explicitly comparing the target class with similar classes and spotting their
differences, Finer-CAM suppresses features shared with other classes and
emphasizes the unique, discriminative details of the target class. Finer-CAM is
easy to implement, compatible with various CAM methods, and can be extended to
multi-modal models for accurate localization of specific concepts.
Additionally, Finer-CAM allows adjustable comparison strength, enabling users
to selectively highlight coarse object contours or fine discriminative details.
Quantitatively, we show that masking out the top 5% of activated pixels by
Finer-CAM results in a larger relative confidence drop compared to baselines.

## A Framework for Evaluating Emerging Cyberattack Capabilities of AI

**Authors:** Mikel Rodriguez, Raluca Ada Popa, Four Flynn, Lihao Liang, Allan Dafoe, Anna Wang
**Categories:** cs.CR, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11917v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
As frontier AI models become more capable, evaluating their potential to
enable cyberattacks is crucial for ensuring the safe development of Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI). Current cyber evaluation efforts are often ad-hoc,
lacking systematic analysis of attack phases and guidance on targeted defenses.
This work introduces a novel evaluation framework that addresses these
limitations by: (1) examining the end-to-end attack chain, (2) identifying gaps
in AI threat evaluation, and (3) helping defenders prioritize targeted
mitigations and conduct AI-enabled adversary emulation for red teaming. Our
approach adapts existing cyberattack chain frameworks for AI systems. We
analyzed over 12,000 real-world instances of AI use in cyberattacks catalogued
by Google's Threat Intelligence Group. Based on this analysis, we curated seven
representative cyberattack chain archetypes and conducted a bottleneck analysis
to pinpoint potential AI-driven cost disruptions. Our benchmark comprises 50
new challenges spanning various cyberattack phases. Using this benchmark, we
devised targeted cybersecurity model evaluations, report on AI's potential to
amplify offensive capabilities across specific attack phases, and offer
recommendations for prioritizing defenses. We believe this represents the most
comprehensive AI cyber risk evaluation framework published to date.

**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19706v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
View-invariant representation learning from egocentric (first-person, ego)
and exocentric (third-person, exo) videos is a promising approach toward
generalizing video understanding systems across multiple viewpoints. However,
this area has been underexplored due to the substantial differences in
perspective, motion patterns, and context between ego and exo views. In this
paper, we propose a novel masked ego-exo modeling that promotes both causal
temporal dynamics and cross-view alignment, called Bootstrap Your Own Views
(BYOV), for fine-grained view-invariant video representation learning from
unpaired ego-exo videos. We highlight the importance of capturing the
compositional nature of human actions as a basis for robust cross-view
understanding. Specifically, self-view masking and cross-view masking
predictions are designed to learn view-invariant and powerful representations
concurrently. Experimental results demonstrate that our BYOV significantly
surpasses existing approaches with notable gains across all metrics in four
downstream ego-exo video tasks. The code is available at
https://github.com/park-jungin/byov.

## Context-Aware Weakly Supervised Image Manipulation Localization with SAM Refinement

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20294v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Malicious image manipulation poses societal risks, increasing the importance
of effective image manipulation detection methods. Recent approaches in image
manipulation detection have largely been driven by fully supervised approaches,
which require labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. Thus, it is essential to
explore weakly supervised image manipulation localization methods that only
require image-level binary labels for training. However, existing weakly
supervised image manipulation methods overlook the importance of edge
information for accurate localization, leading to suboptimal localization
performance. To address this, we propose a Context-Aware Boundary Localization
(CABL) module to aggregate boundary features and learn context-inconsistency
for localizing manipulated areas. Furthermore, by leveraging Class Activation
Mapping (CAM) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), we introduce the CAM-Guided SAM
Refinement (CGSR) module to generate more accurate manipulation localization
maps. By integrating two modules, we present a novel weakly supervised
framework based on a dual-branch Transformer-CNN architecture. Our method
achieves outstanding localization performance across multiple datasets.

**Abstract:**
The discovery of novel small molecule drugs remains a critical scientific
challenge with far-reaching implications for treating diseases and advancing
human health. Traditional drug development--especially for small molecule
therapeutics--is a highly complex, resource-intensive, and time-consuming
process that requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Recent breakthroughs in
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the rise of large language models
(LLMs), present a transformative opportunity to streamline and accelerate this
process. In this paper, we introduce PharmAgents, a virtual pharmaceutical
ecosystem driven by LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. PharmAgents simulates
the full drug discovery workflow--from target discovery to preclinical
evaluation--by integrating explainable, LLM-driven agents equipped with
specialized machine learning models and computational tools. Through structured
knowledge exchange and automated optimization, PharmAgents identifies potential
therapeutic targets, discovers promising lead compounds, enhances binding
affinity and key molecular properties, and performs in silico analyses of
toxicity and synthetic feasibility. Additionally, the system supports
interpretability, agent interaction, and self-evolvement, enabling it to refine
future drug designs based on prior experience. By showcasing the potential of
LLM-powered multi-agent systems in drug discovery, this work establishes a new
paradigm for autonomous, explainable, and scalable pharmaceutical research,
with future extensions toward comprehensive drug lifecycle management.

**Abstract:**
Action models are essential for enabling autonomous agents to perform complex
tasks. However, training large action models remains challenging due to the
diversity of agent environments and the complexity of agentic data. Despite
growing interest, existing infrastructure provides limited support for
scalable, agent-specific fine-tuning. We present ActionStudio, a lightweight
and extensible data and training framework designed for large action models.
ActionStudio unifies heterogeneous agent trajectories through a standardized
format, supports diverse training paradigms including LoRA, full fine-tuning,
and distributed setups, and integrates robust preprocessing and verification
tools. We validate its effectiveness across both public and realistic industry
benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance and practical scalability. We
open-sourced code and data at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/xLAM to

## Finding Interest Needle in Popularity Haystack: Improving Retrieval by Modeling Item Exposure

**Authors:** Amit Jaspal, Rahul Agarwal
**Categories:** cs.IR, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23630v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Recommender systems operate in closed feedback loops, where user interactions
reinforce popularity bias, leading to over-recommendation of already popular
items while under-exposing niche or novel content. Existing bias mitigation
methods, such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and Off- Policy Correction
(OPC), primarily operate at the ranking stage or during training, lacking
explicit real-time control over exposure dynamics. In this work, we introduce
an exposure- aware retrieval scoring approach, which explicitly models item
exposure probability and adjusts retrieval-stage ranking at inference time.
Unlike prior work, this method decouples exposure effects from engagement
likelihood, enabling controlled trade-offs between fairness and engagement in
large-scale recommendation platforms. We validate our approach through online
A/B experiments in a real-world video recommendation system, demonstrating a
25% increase in uniquely retrieved items and a 40% reduction in the dominance
of over-popular content, all while maintaining overall user engagement levels.
Our results establish a scalable, deployable solution for mitigating popularity
bias at the retrieval stage, offering a new paradigm for bias-aware

**Abstract:**
Autonomous driving has made significant progress in both academia and
industry, including performance improvements in perception task and the
development of end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the safety and
robustness assessment of autonomous driving has not received sufficient
attention. Current evaluations of autonomous driving are typically conducted in
natural driving scenarios. However, many accidents often occur in edge cases,
also known as safety-critical scenarios. These safety-critical scenarios are
difficult to collect, and there is currently no clear definition of what
constitutes a safety-critical scenario. In this work, we explore the safety and
robustness of autonomous driving in safety-critical scenarios. First, we
provide a definition of safety-critical scenarios, including static traffic
scenarios such as adversarial attack scenarios and natural distribution shifts,
as well as dynamic traffic scenarios such as accident scenarios. Then, we
develop an autonomous driving safety testing platform to comprehensively
evaluate autonomous driving systems, encompassing not only the assessment of
perception modules but also system-level evaluations. Our work systematically
constructs a safety verification process for autonomous driving, providing
technical support for the industry to establish standardized test framework and
reduce risks in real-world road deployment.

## GNN-Based Candidate Node Predictor for Influence Maximization in Temporal Graphs

**Authors:** Priyanka Gautam, Balasubramaniam Natarajan, Sai Munikoti, S M Ferdous, Mahantesh Halappanavar
**Categories:** cs.SI, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23713v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In an age where information spreads rapidly across social media, effectively
identifying influential nodes in dynamic networks is critical. Traditional
influence maximization strategies often fail to keep up with rapidly evolving
relationships and structures, leading to missed opportunities and
inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a novel learning-based approach
integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory (BiLSTM) models. This hybrid framework captures both structural and
temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of candidate nodes for seed set
selection. The bidirectional nature of BiLSTM allows our model to analyze
patterns from both past and future network states, ensuring adaptability to
changes over time. By dynamically adapting to graph evolution at each time
snapshot, our approach improves seed set calculation efficiency, achieving an
average of 90% accuracy in predicting potential seed nodes across diverse
networks. This significantly reduces computational overhead by optimizing the
number of nodes evaluated for seed selection. Our method is particularly
effective in fields like viral marketing and social network analysis, where
understanding temporal dynamics is crucial.

## LANID: LLM-assisted New Intent Discovery

**Authors:** Lu Fan, Jiashu Pu, Rongsheng Zhang, Xiao-Ming Wu

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23740v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Task-oriented Dialogue Systems (TODS) often face the challenge of
encountering new intents. New Intent Discovery (NID) is a crucial task that
aims to identify these novel intents while maintaining the capability to
recognize existing ones. Previous efforts to adapt TODS to new intents have
struggled with inadequate semantic representation or have depended on external
knowledge, which is often not scalable or flexible. Recently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities; however, their
scale can be impractical for real-world applications that involve extensive
queries. To address the limitations of existing NID methods by leveraging LLMs,
we propose LANID, a framework that enhances the semantic representation of
lightweight NID encoders with the guidance of LLMs. Specifically, LANID employs
the $K$-nearest neighbors and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to sample selective utterance pairs from the
training set. It then queries an LLM to ascertain the relationships between
these pairs. The data produced from this process is utilized to design a
contrastive fine-tuning task, which is then used to train a small encoder with
a contrastive triplet loss. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed method across three distinct NID datasets, surpassing strong
baselines in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. Our code is
available at https://github.com/floatSDSDS/LANID.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23764v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Transformer-based architectures have advanced medical image analysis by
effectively modeling long-range dependencies, yet they often struggle in 3D
settings due to substantial memory overhead and insufficient capture of
fine-grained local features. We address these limi- tations with WaveFormer, a
novel 3D-transformer that: i) leverages the fundamental frequency-domain
properties of features for contextual rep- resentation, and ii) is inspired by
the top-down mechanism of the human visual recognition system, making it a
biologically motivated architec- ture. By employing discrete wavelet
transformations (DWT) at multiple scales, WaveFormer preserves both global
context and high-frequency de- tails while replacing heavy upsampling layers
with efficient wavelet-based summarization and reconstruction. This
significantly reduces the number of parameters, which is critical for
real-world deployment where compu- tational resources and training times are
constrained. Furthermore, the model is generic and easily adaptable to diverse
applications. Evaluations on BraTS2023, FLARE2021, and KiTS2023 demonstrate
performance on par with state-of-the-art methods while offering substantially
lower computational complexity.

## WinoWhat: A Parallel Corpus of Paraphrased WinoGrande Sentences with Common Sense Categorization

**Authors:** Ine Gevers, Victor De Marez, Luna De Bruyne, Walter Daelemans
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23779v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this study, we take a closer look at how Winograd schema challenges can be
used to evaluate common sense reasoning in LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate
generative models of different sizes on the popular WinoGrande benchmark. We
release WinoWhat, a new corpus, in which each instance of the WinoGrande
validation set is paraphrased. Additionally, we evaluate the performance on the
challenge across five common sense knowledge categories, giving more
fine-grained insights on what types of knowledge are more challenging for LLMs.
Surprisingly, all models perform significantly worse on WinoWhat, implying that
LLM reasoning capabilities are overestimated on WinoGrande. To verify whether
this is an effect of benchmark memorization, we match benchmark instances to
LLM trainingdata and create two test-suites. We observe that memorization has a
minimal effect on model performance on WinoGrande.

## MGD-SAM2: Multi-view Guided Detail-enhanced Segment Anything Model 2 for High-Resolution Class-agnostic Segmentation

**Authors:** Haoran Shen, Peixian Zhuang, Jiahao Kou, Yuxin Zeng, Haoying Xu, Jiangyun Li
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23786v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Segment Anything Models (SAMs), as vision foundation models, have
demonstrated remarkable performance across various image analysis tasks.
Despite their strong generalization capabilities, SAMs encounter challenges in
fine-grained detail segmentation for high-resolution class-independent
segmentation (HRCS), due to the limitations in the direct processing of
high-resolution inputs and low-resolution mask predictions, and the reliance on
accurate manual prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MGD-SAM2
which integrates SAM2 with multi-view feature interaction between a global
image and local patches to achieve precise segmentation. MGD-SAM2 incorporates
the pre-trained SAM2 with four novel modules: the Multi-view Perception Adapter
(MPAdapter), the Multi-view Complementary Enhancement Module (MCEM), the
Hierarchical Multi-view Interaction Module (HMIM), and the Detail Refinement
Module (DRM). Specifically, we first introduce MPAdapter to adapt the SAM2
encoder for enhanced extraction of local details and global semantics in HRCS
images. Then, MCEM and HMIM are proposed to further exploit local texture and
global context by aggregating multi-view features within and across
multi-scales. Finally, DRM is designed to generate gradually restored
high-resolution mask predictions, compensating for the loss of fine-grained
details resulting from directly upsampling the low-resolution prediction maps.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and strong
generalization of our model on multiple high-resolution and normal-resolution
datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/sevenshr/MGD-SAM2.

## Adaptive Layer-skipping in Pre-trained LLMs

**Authors:** Xuan Luo, Weizhi Wang, Xifeng Yan
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23798v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Various layer-skipping methods have been proposed to accelerate token
generation in large language models (LLMs). However, they have overlooked a
fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation
of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that
dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation.
By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive
layer-skipping in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Introducing
FlexiDepth to Llama-3-8B model achieves layer skipping of 8 layers out of 32,
and meanwhile maintains the full 100\% benchmark performance. Experimental
results with FlexiDepth demonstrate that computational demands in LLMs
significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive
tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens
involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Interestingly,
this adaptive allocation pattern aligns with human intuition. To advance
research in this area, we open sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting
FlexiDepth's layer allocation patterns for future exploration.

## Thinking Longer, Not Larger: Enhancing Software Engineering Agents via Scaling Test-Time Compute

**Authors:** Yingwei Ma, Binhua Li, Yihong Dong, Xue Jiang, Rongyu Cao, Jue Chen, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li
**Categories:** cs.SE, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23803v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Recent advancements in software engineering agents have demonstrated
promising capabilities in automating program improvements. However, their
reliance on closed-source or resource-intensive models introduces significant
deployment challenges in private environments, prompting a critical question:
\textit{How can personally deployable open-source LLMs achieve comparable code
reasoning performance?}
  To this end, we propose a unified Test-Time Compute scaling framework that
leverages increased inference-time computation instead of larger models. Our
framework incorporates two complementary strategies: internal TTC and external
TTC. Internally, we introduce a \textit{development-contextualized trajectory
synthesis} method leveraging real-world software repositories to bootstrap
multi-stage reasoning processes, such as fault localization and patch
generation. We further enhance trajectory quality through rejection sampling,
rigorously evaluating trajectories along accuracy and complexity. Externally,
we propose a novel \textit{development-process-based search} strategy guided by
reward models and execution verification. This approach enables targeted
computational allocation at critical development decision points, overcoming
limitations of existing "end-point only" verification methods.
  Evaluations on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate our \textbf{32B model achieves
a 46\% issue resolution rate}, surpassing significantly larger models such as
DeepSeek R1 671B and OpenAI o1. Additionally, we provide the empirical
validation of the test-time scaling phenomenon within SWE agents, revealing
that \textbf{models dynamically allocate more tokens to increasingly
challenging problems}, effectively enhancing reasoning capabilities. We
publicly release all training data, models, and code to facilitate future
research. https://github.com/yingweima2022/SWE-Reasoner

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, are garnering
significant attention. During the exploration of MLLM training, we identified
Modality Composition Incoherence, a phenomenon that the proportion of a certain
modality varies dramatically across different examples. It exacerbates the
challenges of addressing mini-batch imbalances, which lead to uneven GPU
utilization between Data Parallel (DP) instances and severely degrades the
efficiency and scalability of MLLM training, ultimately affecting training
speed and hindering further research on MLLMs.
  To address these challenges, we introduce OrchMLLM, a comprehensive framework
designed to mitigate the inefficiencies in MLLM training caused by Modality
Composition Incoherence. First, we propose Batch Post-Balancing Dispatcher, a
technique that efficiently eliminates mini-batch imbalances in sequential data.
Additionally, we integrate MLLM Global Orchestrator into the training framework
to orchestrate multimodal data and tackle the issues arising from Modality
Composition Incoherence. We evaluate OrchMLLM across various MLLM sizes,
demonstrating its efficiency and scalability. Experimental results reveal that
OrchMLLM achieves a Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) of $41.6\%$ when training an
84B MLLM with three modalities on $2560$ H100 GPUs, outperforming Megatron-LM
by up to $3.1\times$ in throughput.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23862v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Digital pathology images play a crucial role in medical diagnostics, but
their ultra-high resolution and large file sizes pose significant challenges
for storage, transmission, and real-time visualization. To address these
issues, we propose CLERIC, a novel deep learning-based image compression
framework designed specifically for whole slide images (WSIs). CLERIC
integrates a learnable lifting scheme and advanced convolutional techniques to
enhance compression efficiency while preserving critical pathological details.
Our framework employs a lifting-scheme transform in the analysis stage to
decompose images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling more
structured latent representations. These components are processed through
parallel encoders incorporating Deformable Residual Blocks (DRB) and Recurrent
Residual Blocks (R2B) to improve feature extraction and spatial adaptability.
The synthesis stage applies an inverse lifting transform for effective image
reconstruction, ensuring high-fidelity restoration of fine-grained tissue
structures. We evaluate CLERIC on a digital pathology image dataset and compare
its performance against state-of-the-art learned image compression (LIC)
models. Experimental results demonstrate that CLERIC achieves superior
rate-distortion (RD) performance, significantly reducing storage requirements
while maintaining high diagnostic image quality. Our study highlights the
potential of deep learning-based compression in digital pathology, facilitating
efficient data management and long-term storage while ensuring seamless
integration into clinical workflows and AI-assisted diagnostic systems. Code

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23886v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The relational database design would output a schema based on user's
requirements, which defines table structures and their interrelated relations.
Translating requirements into accurate schema involves several non-trivial
subtasks demanding both database expertise and domain-specific knowledge. This
poses unique challenges for automated design of relational databases. Existing
efforts are mostly based on customized rules or conventional deep learning
models, often producing suboptimal schema. Recently, large language models
(LLMs) have significantly advanced intelligent application development across
various domains. In this paper, we propose SchemaAgent, a unified LLM-based
multi-agent framework for the automated generation of high-quality database
schema. SchemaAgent is the first to apply LLMs for schema generation, which
emulates the workflow of manual schema design by assigning specialized roles to
agents and enabling effective collaboration to refine their respective
subtasks. Schema generation is a streamlined workflow, where directly applying
the multi-agent framework may cause compounding impact of errors. To address
this, we incorporate dedicated roles for reflection and inspection, alongside
an innovative error detection and correction mechanism to identify and rectify
issues across various phases. For evaluation, we present a benchmark named
\textit{RSchema}, which contains more than 500 pairs of requirement description
and schema. Experimental results on this benchmark demonstrate the superiority
of our approach over mainstream LLMs for relational database schema generation.

## MuseFace: Text-driven Face Editing via Diffusion-based Mask Generation Approach

**Authors:** Xin Zhang, Siting Huang, Xiangyang Luo, Yifan Xie, Weijiang Yu, Heng Chang, Fei Ma, Fei Yu
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23888v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Face editing modifies the appearance of face, which plays a key role in
customization and enhancement of personal images. Although much work have
achieved remarkable success in text-driven face editing, they still face
significant challenges as none of them simultaneously fulfill the
characteristics of diversity, controllability and flexibility. To address this
challenge, we propose MuseFace, a text-driven face editing framework, which
relies solely on text prompt to enable face editing. Specifically, MuseFace
integrates a Text-to-Mask diffusion model and a semantic-aware face editing
model, capable of directly generating fine-grained semantic masks from text and
performing face editing. The Text-to-Mask diffusion model provides
\textit{diversity} and \textit{flexibility} to the framework, while the
semantic-aware face editing model ensures \textit{controllability} of the
framework. Our framework can create fine-grained semantic masks, making precise
face editing possible, and significantly enhancing the controllability and
flexibility of face editing models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MuseFace achieves superior high-fidelity performance.

## Better wit than wealth: Dynamic Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation for Test-time Knowledge Enhancement

**Authors:** Yuqiao Tan, Shizhu He, Huanxuan Liao, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23895v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources and incorporating them into
the context. While it improves reliability by providing factual texts, it
significantly increases inference costs as context length grows and introduces
challenging issue of RAG hallucination, primarily caused by the lack of
corresponding parametric knowledge in LLMs. An efficient solution is to enhance
the knowledge of LLMs at test-time. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by
embedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge
enhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training.
However, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization
ability, significantly restrict its practical adoption. To address these
challenges, we propose Dynamic Parametric RAG (DyPRAG), a novel framework that
leverages a lightweight parameter translator model to efficiently convert
documents into parametric knowledge. DyPRAG not only reduces inference,
training, and storage costs but also dynamically generates parametric
knowledge, seamlessly enhancing the knowledge of LLMs and resolving knowledge
conflicts in a plug-and-play manner at test-time. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities
of DyPRAG, offering a powerful and practical RAG paradigm which enables
superior knowledge fusion and mitigates RAG hallucination in real-world
applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/DyPRAG.

## Training-Free Text-Guided Image Editing with Visual Autoregressive Model

**Authors:** Yufei Wang, Lanqing Guo, Zhihao Li, Jiaxing Huang, Pichao Wang, Bihan Wen, Jian Wang
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23897v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Text-guided image editing is an essential task that enables users to modify
images through natural language descriptions. Recent advances in diffusion
models and rectified flows have significantly improved editing quality,
primarily relying on inversion techniques to extract structured noise from
input images. However, inaccuracies in inversion can propagate errors, leading
to unintended modifications and compromising fidelity. Moreover, even with
perfect inversion, the entanglement between textual prompts and image features
often results in global changes when only local edits are intended. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel text-guided image editing framework based
on VAR (Visual AutoRegressive modeling), which eliminates the need for explicit
inversion while ensuring precise and controlled modifications. Our method
introduces a caching mechanism that stores token indices and probability
distributions from the original image, capturing the relationship between the
source prompt and the image. Using this cache, we design an adaptive
fine-grained masking strategy that dynamically identifies and constrains
modifications to relevant regions, preventing unintended changes. A token
reassembling approach further refines the editing process, enhancing diversity,
fidelity, and control. Our framework operates in a training-free manner and
achieves high-fidelity editing with faster inference speeds, processing a 1K
resolution image in as fast as 1.2 seconds. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing,
existing diffusion- and rectified flow-based approaches in both quantitative
metrics and visual quality. The code will be released.

**Abstract:**
Image Aesthetic Assessment (IAA) is a long-standing and challenging research
task. However, its subset, Human Image Aesthetic Assessment (HIAA), has been
scarcely explored, even though HIAA is widely used in social media, AI
workflows, and related domains. To bridge this research gap, our work pioneers
a holistic implementation framework tailored for HIAA. Specifically, we
introduce HumanBeauty, the first dataset purpose-built for HIAA, which
comprises 108k high-quality human images with manual annotations. To achieve
comprehensive and fine-grained HIAA, 50K human images are manually collected
through a rigorous curation process and annotated leveraging our trailblazing
12-dimensional aesthetic standard, while the remaining 58K with overall
aesthetic labels are systematically filtered from public datasets. Based on the
HumanBeauty database, we propose HumanAesExpert, a powerful Vision Language
Model for aesthetic evaluation of human images. We innovatively design an
Expert head to incorporate human knowledge of aesthetic sub-dimensions while
jointly utilizing the Language Modeling (LM) and Regression head. This approach
empowers our model to achieve superior proficiency in both overall and
fine-grained HIAA. Furthermore, we introduce a MetaVoter, which aggregates
scores from all three heads, to effectively balance the capabilities of each
head, thereby realizing improved assessment precision. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our HumanAesExpert models deliver significantly better
performance in HIAA than other state-of-the-art models. Our datasets, models,
and codes are publicly released to advance the HIAA community. Project webpage:

**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23956v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained
significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and
proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual
tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational
overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address
this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression
method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically
investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the
attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable
redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these
tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context
generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation
window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,
focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced
multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise
budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of
token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to
uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the
full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing
decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of
inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits
increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Since the disruption in LLM technology brought about by the release of GPT-3
and ChatGPT, LLMs have shown remarkable promise in programming-related tasks.
While code generation remains a popular field of research, code evaluation
using LLMs remains a problem with no conclusive solution. In this paper, we
focus on LLM-based code evaluation and attempt to fill in the existing gaps. We
propose multi-agentic novel approaches using question-specific rubrics tailored
to the problem statement, arguing that these perform better for logical
assessment than the existing approaches that use question-agnostic rubrics. To
address the lack of suitable evaluation datasets, we introduce two datasets: a
Data Structures and Algorithms dataset containing 150 student submissions from
a popular Data Structures and Algorithms practice website, and an Object
Oriented Programming dataset comprising 80 student submissions from
undergraduate computer science courses. In addition to using standard metrics
(Spearman Correlation, Cohen's Kappa), we additionally propose a new metric
called as Leniency, which quantifies evaluation strictness relative to expert
assessment. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that question-specific
rubrics significantly enhance logical assessment of code in educational
settings, providing better feedback aligned with instructional goals beyond
mere syntactic correctness.

## DenseFormer: Learning Dense Depth Map from Sparse Depth and Image via Conditional Diffusion Model

**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23993v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The depth completion task is a critical problem in autonomous driving,
involving the generation of dense depth maps from sparse depth maps and RGB
images. Most existing methods employ a spatial propagation network to
iteratively refine the depth map after obtaining an initial dense depth. In
this paper, we propose DenseFormer, a novel method that integrates the
diffusion model into the depth completion task. By incorporating the denoising
mechanism of the diffusion model, DenseFormer generates the dense depth map by
progressively refining an initial random depth distribution through multiple
iterations. We propose a feature extraction module that leverages a feature
pyramid structure, along with multi-layer deformable attention, to effectively
extract and integrate features from sparse depth maps and RGB images, which
serve as the guiding condition for the diffusion process. Additionally, this
paper presents a depth refinement module that applies multi-step iterative
refinement across various ranges to the dense depth results generated by the
diffusion process. The module utilizes image features enriched with multi-scale
information and sparse depth input to further enhance the accuracy of the
predicted depth map. Extensive experiments on the KITTI outdoor scene dataset
demonstrate that DenseFormer outperforms classical depth completion methods.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24008v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
With the rapid development of multimodal models, the demand for assessing
video understanding capabilities has been steadily increasing. However,
existing benchmarks for evaluating video understanding exhibit significant
limitations in coverage, task diversity, and scene adaptability. These
shortcomings hinder the accurate assessment of models' comprehensive video
understanding capabilities. To tackle this challenge, we propose a hierarchical
and holistic video understanding (H2VU) benchmark designed to evaluate both
general video and online streaming video comprehension. This benchmark
contributes three key features:
  Extended video duration: Spanning videos from brief 3-second clips to
comprehensive 1.5-hour recordings, thereby bridging the temporal gaps found in
current benchmarks. Comprehensive assessment tasks: Beyond traditional
perceptual and reasoning tasks, we have introduced modules for
countercommonsense comprehension and trajectory state tracking. These additions
test the models' deep understanding capabilities beyond mere prior knowledge.
Enriched video data: To keep pace with the rapid evolution of current AI
agents, we have expanded first-person streaming video datasets. This expansion
allows for the exploration of multimodal models' performance in understanding
streaming videos from a first-person perspective. Extensive results from H2VU
reveal that existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) possess
substantial potential for improvement in our newly proposed evaluation tasks.
We expect that H2VU will facilitate advancements in video understanding
research by offering a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of MLLMs.

**Abstract:**
As scientific research becomes increasingly complex, innovative tools are
needed to manage vast data, facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, and
accelerate discovery. Large language models (LLMs) are now evolving into
LLM-based scientific agents that automate critical tasks, ranging from
hypothesis generation and experiment design to data analysis and simulation.
Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these specialized agents integrate domain-specific
knowledge, advanced tool sets, and robust validation mechanisms, enabling them
to handle complex data types, ensure reproducibility, and drive scientific
breakthroughs. This survey provides a focused review of the architectures,
design, benchmarks, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding
LLM-based scientific agents. We highlight why they differ from general agents
and the ways in which they advance research across various scientific fields.
By examining their development and challenges, this survey offers a
comprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to harness these agents
for more efficient, reliable, and ethically sound scientific discovery.

## PolypSegTrack: Unified Foundation Model for Colonoscopy Video Analysis

**Authors:** Anwesa Choudhuri, Zhongpai Gao, Meng Zheng, Benjamin Planche, Terrence Chen, Ziyan Wu

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24108v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Early detection, accurate segmentation, classification and tracking of polyps
during colonoscopy are critical for preventing colorectal cancer. Many existing
deep-learning-based methods for analyzing colonoscopic videos either require
task-specific fine-tuning, lack tracking capabilities, or rely on
domain-specific pre-training. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{PolypSegTrack}, a novel foundation model that jointly addresses polyp
detection, segmentation, classification and unsupervised tracking in
colonoscopic videos. Our approach leverages a novel conditional mask loss,
enabling flexible training across datasets with either pixel-level segmentation
masks or bounding box annotations, allowing us to bypass task-specific
fine-tuning. Our unsupervised tracking module reliably associates polyp
instances across frames using object queries, without relying on any
heuristics. We leverage a robust vision foundation model backbone that is
pre-trained unsupervisedly on natural images, thereby removing the need for
domain-specific pre-training. Extensive experiments on multiple polyp
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches in detection, segmentation, classification, and
tracking.

## Grounding Agent Reasoning in Image Schemas: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Embodied Cognition

**Authors:** François Olivier, Zied Bouraoui
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24110v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Despite advances in embodied AI, agent reasoning systems still struggle to
capture the fundamental conceptual structures that humans naturally use to
understand and interact with their environment. To address this, we propose a
novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by
leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as
recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition.
By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal
representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create
a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental
conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency
and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions
through shared embodied understanding.

## Resonance: Drawing from Memories to Imagine Positive Futures through AI-Augmented Journaling

**Authors:** Wazeer Zulfikar, Treyden Chiaravalloti, Jocelyn Shen, Rosalind Picard, Pattie Maes
**Categories:** cs.HC, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24145v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
People inherently use experiences of their past while imagining their future,
a capability that plays a crucial role in mental health. Resonance is an
AI-powered journaling tool designed to augment this ability by offering
AI-generated, action-oriented suggestions for future activities based on the
user's own past memories. Suggestions are offered when a new memory is logged
and are followed by a prompt for the user to imagine carrying out the
suggestion. In a two-week randomized controlled study (N=55), we found that
using Resonance significantly improved mental health outcomes, reducing the
users' PHQ8 scores, a measure of current depression, and increasing their daily
positive affect, particularly when they would likely act on the suggestion.
Notably, the effectiveness of the suggestions was higher when they were
personal, novel, and referenced the user's logged memories. Finally, through
open-ended feedback, we discuss the factors that encouraged or hindered the use
of the tool.

## Output Constraints as Attack Surface: Exploiting Structured Generation to Bypass LLM Safety Mechanisms

**Authors:** Shuoming Zhang, Jiacheng Zhao, Ruiyuan Xu, Xiaobing Feng, Huimin Cui
**Categories:** cs.CR, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24191v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Content Warning: This paper may contain unsafe or harmful content generated
by LLMs that may be offensive to readers. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
extensively used as tooling platforms through structured output APIs to ensure
syntax compliance so that robust integration with existing softwares like agent
systems, could be achieved. However, the feature enabling functionality of
grammar-guided structured output presents significant security vulnerabilities.
In this work, we reveal a critical control-plane attack surface orthogonal to
traditional data-plane vulnerabilities. We introduce Constrained Decoding
Attack (CDA), a novel jailbreak class that weaponizes structured output
constraints to bypass safety mechanisms. Unlike prior attacks focused on input
prompts, CDA operates by embedding malicious intent in schema-level grammar
rules (control-plane) while maintaining benign surface prompts (data-plane). We
instantiate this with a proof-of-concept Chain Enum Attack, achieves 96.2%
attack success rates across proprietary and open-weight LLMs on five safety
benchmarks with a single query, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-flash. Our
findings identify a critical security blind spot in current LLM architectures
and urge a paradigm shift in LLM safety to address control-plane
vulnerabilities, as current mechanisms focused solely on data-plane threats
leave critical systems exposed.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24199v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
User engagement on social media platforms is influenced by historical
context, time constraints, and reward-driven interactions. This study presents
an agent-based simulation approach that models user interactions, considering
past conversation history, motivation, and resource constraints. Utilizing
German Twitter data on political discourse, we fine-tune AI models to generate
posts and replies, incorporating sentiment analysis, irony detection, and
offensiveness classification. The simulation employs a myopic best-response
model to govern agent behavior, accounting for decision-making based on
expected rewards. Our results highlight the impact of historical context on
AI-generated responses and demonstrate how engagement evolves under varying
constraints.

## What, How, Where, and How Well? A Survey on Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models

**Authors:** Qiyuan Zhang, Fuyuan Lyu, Zexu Sun, Lei Wang, Weixu Zhang, Zhihan Guo, Yufei Wang, Irwin King, Xue Liu, Chen Ma
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24235v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the
pretraining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS), also referred to
as ``test-time computing'' has emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent
studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant
breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and
coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the
explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a
comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we
propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core
dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and
how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review
of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an
organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of
individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we
distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on
guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open
challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including
further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing
to more tasks, and more attributions.

## Beyond a Single Mode: GAN Ensembles for Diverse Medical Data Generation

**Authors:** Lorenzo Tronchin, Tommy Löfstedt, Paolo Soda, Valerio Guarrasi
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24258v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The advancement of generative AI, particularly in medical imaging, confronts
the trilemma of ensuring high fidelity, diversity, and efficiency in synthetic
data generation. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown
promise across various applications, they still face challenges like mode
collapse and insufficient coverage of real data distributions. This work
explores the use of GAN ensembles to overcome these limitations, specifically
in the context of medical imaging. By solving a multi-objective optimisation
problem that balances fidelity and diversity, we propose a method for selecting
an optimal ensemble of GANs tailored for medical data. The selected ensemble is
capable of generating diverse synthetic medical images that are representative
of true data distributions and computationally efficient. Each model in the
ensemble brings a unique contribution, ensuring minimal redundancy. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation using three distinct medical datasets,
testing 22 different GAN architectures with various loss functions and
regularisation techniques. By sampling models at different training epochs, we
crafted 110 unique configurations. The results highlight the capability of GAN
ensembles to enhance the quality and utility of synthetic medical images,
thereby improving the efficacy of downstream tasks such as diagnostic
modelling.

## Visual Acoustic Fields

**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24270v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Objects produce different sounds when hit, and humans can intuitively infer
how an object might sound based on its appearance and material properties.
Inspired by this intuition, we propose Visual Acoustic Fields, a framework that
bridges hitting sounds and visual signals within a 3D space using 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and
sound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional
diffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a
feature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the
sound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the
feature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound
sources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for
collecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between
captured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in
a 3D context. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of Visual Acoustic Fields in generating plausible impact sounds
and accurately localizing impact sources. Our project page is at

## AutoEval: Autonomous Evaluation of Generalist Robot Manipulation Policies in the Real World

**Authors:** Zhiyuan Zhou, Pranav Atreya, You Liang Tan, Karl Pertsch, Sergey Levine
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24278v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Scalable and reproducible policy evaluation has been a long-standing
challenge in robot learning. Evaluations are critical to assess progress and
build better policies, but evaluation in the real world, especially at a scale
that would provide statistically reliable results, is costly in terms of human
time and hard to obtain. Evaluation of increasingly generalist robot policies
requires an increasingly diverse repertoire of evaluation environments, making
the evaluation bottleneck even more pronounced. To make real-world evaluation
of robotic policies more practical, we propose AutoEval, a system to
autonomously evaluate generalist robot policies around the clock with minimal
human intervention. Users interact with AutoEval by submitting evaluation jobs
to the AutoEval queue, much like how software jobs are submitted with a cluster
scheduling system, and AutoEval will schedule the policies for evaluation
within a framework supplying automatic success detection and automatic scene
resets. We show that AutoEval can nearly fully eliminate human involvement in
the evaluation process, permitting around the clock evaluations, and the
evaluation results correspond closely to ground truth evaluations conducted by
hand. To facilitate the evaluation of generalist policies in the robotics
community, we provide public access to multiple AutoEval scenes in the popular
BridgeData robot setup with WidowX robot arms. In the future, we hope that
AutoEval scenes can be set up across institutions to form a diverse and
distributed evaluation network.

## Shape Expressions with Inheritance

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24299v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We formally introduce an inheritance mechanism for the Shape Expressions
language (ShEx). It is inspired by inheritance in object-oriented programming
languages, and provides similar advantages such as reuse, modularity, and more
flexible data modelling. Using an example, we explain the main features of the
inheritance mechanism. We present its syntax and formal semantics. The
semantics is an extension of the semantics of ShEx 2.1. It also directly yields
a validation algorithm as an extension of the previous ShEx validation
algorithms, while maintaining the same algorithmic complexity.

## BEATS: Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite for Large Language Models

**Authors:** Alok Abhishek, Lisa Erickson, Tushar Bandopadhyay

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24310v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this research, we introduce BEATS, a novel framework for evaluating Bias,
Ethics, Fairness, and Factuality in Large Language Models (LLMs). Building upon
the BEATS framework, we present a bias benchmark for LLMs that measure
performance across 29 distinct metrics. These metrics span a broad range of
characteristics, including demographic, cognitive, and social biases, as well
as measures of ethical reasoning, group fairness, and factuality related
misinformation risk. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the
extent to which LLM generated responses may perpetuate societal prejudices that
reinforce or expand systemic inequities. To achieve a high score on this
benchmark a LLM must show very equitable behavior in their responses, making it
a rigorous standard for responsible AI evaluation. Empirical results based on
data from our experiment show that, 37.65\% of outputs generated by industry
leading models contained some form of bias, highlighting a substantial risk of
using these models in critical decision making systems. BEATS framework and
benchmark offer a scalable and statistically rigorous methodology to benchmark
LLMs, diagnose factors driving biases, and develop mitigation strategies. With
the BEATS framework, our goal is to help the development of more socially
responsible and ethically aligned AI models.

## Harnessing the Reasoning Economy: A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for Large Language Models

**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24377v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, transitioning from
fast and intuitive thinking (System 1) to slow and deep reasoning (System 2).
While System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial
computational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or
unnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is
computationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it
is critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and
computational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy.
In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in
both the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i)
the cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different
reasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy.
By offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to
shed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby
serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area. We
also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
To address the bottleneck of accurate user intent interpretation within the
current video generation community, we present Any2Caption, a novel framework
for controllable video generation under any condition. The key idea is to
decouple various condition interpretation steps from the video synthesis step.
By leveraging modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), Any2Caption
interprets diverse inputs--text, images, videos, and specialized cues such as
region, motion, and camera poses--into dense, structured captions that offer
backbone video generators with better guidance. We also introduce Any2CapIns, a
large-scale dataset with 337K instances and 407K conditions for
any-condition-to-caption instruction tuning. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate significant improvements of our system in controllability and video
quality across various aspects of existing video generation models. Project

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12733v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In the synthetic geometric setting introduced by Kunzinger and S\"amann, we
present an analogue of Toponogov's Globalisation Theorem which applies to
Lorentzian length spaces with lower (timelike) curvature bounds. Our approach
utilises a "cat's cradle" construction akin to that which appears in several
proofs in the metric setting. On the road to our main result, we also provide a
lemma regarding the subdivision of triangles in spaces with a local lower
curvature bound and a synthetic Lorentzian version of the Lebesgue Number
Lemma. Several properties of time functions and the null distance on globally
hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces are also highlighted. We conclude by
presenting several applications of our results, including versions of the
Bonnet--Myers Theorem and the Splitting Theorem for Lorentzian length spaces
with local lower curvature bounds, as well as discussion of stability of
curvature bounds under Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.

## A unified framework for N-phase Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn mixture models with non-matching densities

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20145v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Over the past few decades, numerous N-phase incompressible diffuse-interface
flow models with non-matching densities have been proposed. Despite aiming to
describe the same physics, these models are generally distinct, and an
overarching modeling framework is absent. This paper provides a unified
framework for N-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn
mixture models with a single momentum equation. The framework naturally emerges
from continuum mixture theory, exhibits an energy-dissipative structure, and is
invariant to the choice of fundamental variables. This opens the door to
exploring connections between existing N-phase models and facilitates the
computation of N-phase flow models rooted in continuum mixture theory.

## Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras II: Convergence of Sewing and Higher Genus Pseudo-$q$-traces

**Authors:** Bin Gui, Hao Zhang
**Categories:** math.QA, math-ph, math.MP, math.RT
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07707v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite
vertex operator algebra. We prove the convergence of Segal's sewing of
conformal blocks associated to analytic families of pointed compact Riemann
surfaces and grading-restricted generalized $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$-modules
(where $N=1,2,\dots$) that are not necessarily tensor products of $\mathbb
V$-modules, generalizing significantly the results on convergence in [Gui23].
  We show that ``higher genus pseudo-$q$-traces" (called pseudo-sewing in this
article) can be recovered from Segal's sewing. Therefore, our result on the
convergence of Segal's sewing implies the convergence of pseudo-sewing, and
hence covers both the convergence of genus-$0$ sewing in [HLZ12] and the
convergence of pseudo-$q$-traces in [Miy04] and [Fio16].
  Using a similar method, we also prove the convergence of Virasoro
uniformization, i.e., the convergence of conformal blocks deformed by
non-automomous meromorphic vector fields near the marked points. The local
freeness of the analytic sheaves of conformal blocks is a consequence of this
convergence. It will be used in the third paper of this series to prove the
sewing-factorization theorem.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20546v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion
category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free
fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local
symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an
``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry
operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular,
we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with
non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge
category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is
forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all
three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and
further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.

## Dafermos' principle and Brenier's duality scheme for defocusing dispersive equations

**Authors:** Dmitry Vorotnikov
**Categories:** math.AP, math-ph, math.FA, math.MP, 35D99, 35L90, 37K58, 47A56, 49Q99
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05389v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We discover an abstract structure behind several nonlinear dispersive
equations (including the NLS, NLKG and GKdV equations with generic defocusing
power-law nonlinearities) that is reminiscent of hyperbolic conservation laws.
The underlying abstract problem admits an "entropy" that is formally conserved.
The entropy is determined by a strictly convex function that naturally
generates an anisotropic Orlicz space. For such problems, we introduce the dual
matrix-valued variational formulation in the spirit of [Y. Brenier. Comm. Math.
Phys. (2018) 364(2) 579-605]. Employing time-adaptive weights, we are able to
prove consistency of the duality scheme on large time intervals. We also prove
solvability of the dual problem in the corresponding anisotropic Orlicz spaces.
As an application, we show that no subsolution of the PDEs that fit into our
framework is able to dissipate the total entropy earlier or faster than the
strong solution on the interval of existence of the latter. This result (we
call it Dafermos' principle) is new even for "isotropic" problems such as the
incompressible Euler system.

**Abstract:**
The one-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ $q$-state Potts model is solved exactly for
arbitrary $q$, based on using OpenAI's latest reasoning model o3-mini-high to
exactly solve the $q=3$ case. The exact results provide insights to outstanding
physical problems such as the stacking of atomic or electronic orders in
layered materials and the formation of a $T_c$-dome-shaped phase often seen in
unconventional superconductors. The work is anticipated to fuel both the
research in one-dimensional frustrated magnets for recently discovered
finite-temperature application potentials and the fast moving topic area of AI
for sciences.

## Transmission resonances in scattering by $δ'$-like combs

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23837v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We introduce a new exactly solvable model in quantum mechanics that describes
the propagation of particles through a potential field created by regularly
spaced $\delta'$-type point interactions, which model the localized dipoles
often observed in crystal structures. We refer to the corresponding potentials
as $\delta'_\theta$-combs, where the parameter $\theta$ represents the contrast
of the resonant wave at zero energy and determines the interface conditions in
the Hamiltonians. We explicitly calculate the scattering matrix for these
systems and prove that the transmission probability exhibits sharp resonance
peaks while rapidly decaying at other frequencies. Consequently, Hamiltonians
with $\delta'_\theta$-comb potentials act as quantum filters, permitting
tunnelling only for specific wave frequencies.

## Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras III: The Sewing-Factorization Theorems

**Authors:** Bin Gui, Hao Zhang
**Categories:** math.QA, math-ph, math.MP, math.RT
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23995v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite
VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various
versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks
associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$
(where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the
Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem:
  Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$
outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann
surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb
W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb
V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak
G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes
R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing
marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the
corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb
M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb
X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing
$\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the
sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ24]-yields an
isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb
V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb
M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb
M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb
X)$$
  We also discuss the relation between conformal blocks and the modular
functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend in the case where $\mathbb V$ is
strongly finite and rigid.

**Abstract:**
In this article we study a one dimensional model for Magnetic Relaxation.
This model was introduced by Moffatt and describes a low resistivity viscous
plasma, in which the pressure and the inercia are much smaller than the
magnetic pressure. In the limit of resistivity $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$, we
prove the existence of two time scales for the evolution of the magnetic field:
a fast one for times of order $\log(\varepsilon^{-1})$ in which the resistivity
plays no role and the energy is dissipated only via viscosity; and a slow one
for times of order $\varepsilon^{-1}$ characterized by the influence of the
resistivity. We show that in this second time scale, as $\varepsilon\rightarrow
0$, the modulus of magnetic field approaches a function that depends only on
time. We also prove that, in this regime, the magnetic field
$b_\varepsilon(t,x)$ can be approximated as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ by the
solution of a PDE whose solutions exhibit blow up for some choices of initial
data.

## Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of mass-deformed type IIB matrix model

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied. The mass-deformed IIB
matrix model admits classical solutions constructed from the basis of any
semisimple Lie algebra. We consider the geometry described by the classical
solutions of the Lie algebras in the limit where the mass vanishes and the
matrix size is infinite. Lie-Poisson varieties are regarded as such geometric
objects. We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization''of any
Lie-Poisson algebra (linear Poisson algebra) on the algebraic variety defined
by its Casimir polynomials. The Lie algebra that gives weak matrix
regularization is not necessarily semisimple. Casimir polynomials correspond
with Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization. This
quantization is a generalization of the fuzzy sphere. In order to define the
weak matrix regularization of the quotient space by the ideal generated by the
Casimir polynomials, we take a construction method that fixes a reduced
Gr\"obner basis of the ideal. The Gr\"obner basis determines remainders of
polynomials. The operation of replacing this remainders with representation
matrices of a Lie algebra roughly corresponds to a weak matrix regularization.
As concrete examples, we construct weak matrix regularization for $su(2)$ and
$su(3)$. In the case of $su(3)$, we not only construct weak matrix
regularization for the quadratic Casimir polynomial, but also construct weak
matrix regularization for the cubic Casimir polynomial.

## Compressible N-phase fluid mixture models

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24225v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Fluid mixture models are essential for describing a wide range of physical
phenomena, including wave dynamics and spinodal decomposition. However, there
is a lack of consensus in the modeling of compressible mixtures, with limited
connections between different classes of models. On the one hand, existing
compressible two-phase flow models accurately describe wave dynamics, but do
not incorporate phase separation mechanisms. On the other hand, phase-field
technology in fluid dynamics consists of models incorporating spinodal
decomposition, however, a general phase-field theory for compressible mixtures
remains largely undeveloped.
  In this paper, we take an initial step toward bridging the gap between
compressible two-phase flow models and phase-field models by developing a
theory for compressible, isothermal N-phase mixtures. Our theory establishes a
system of reduced complexity by formulating N mass balance laws alongside a
single momentum balance law, thereby naturally extending the Navier-Stokes
Korteweg model to N-phases and providing the Navier-Stokes
Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn model for compressible mixtures. Key aspects of the
framework include its grounding in continuum mixture theory and its
preservation of thermodynamic consistency despite its reduced complexity.

## PhD Thesis: Shifted Contact Structures on Differentiable Stacks

**Authors:** Antonio Maglio
**Categories:** math.DG, math-ph, math.MP, math.SG, 22A22, 53D10, 53D17, 18N50
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24238v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This thesis focuses on developing "stacky" versions of contact structures,
extending the classical notion of contact structures on manifolds. A fruitful
approach is to study contact structures using line bundle-valued $1$-forms.
Specifically, we introduce the notions of $0$ and $+1$-shifted contact
structures on Lie groupoids. To define the kernel of a line bundle-valued
$1$-form $\theta$ on a Lie groupoid, we draw inspiration from the concept of
the homotopy kernel in Homological Algebra. That kernel is essentially given by
a representation up to homotopy (RUTH). Similarly, the curvature is described
by a specific RUTH morphism. Both the definitions are motivated by the
Symplectic-to-Contact Dictionary, which establishes a relationship between
Symplectic and Contact Geometry. Examples of $0$-shifted contact structures can
be found in contact structures on orbifolds, while examples of $+1$-shifted
contact structures include the prequantization of $+1$-shifted symplectic
structures and the integration of Dirac-Jacobi structures.

## A criterion on the free energy for log-Sobolev inequalities in mean-field particle systems

**Authors:** R. Bauerschmidt, T. Bodineau, B. Dagallier

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24372v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
For a class of mean-field particle systems, we formulate a criterion in terms
of the free energy that implies uniform bounds on the log-Sobolev constant of
the associated Langevin dynamics. For certain double-well potentials with
quadratic interaction, the criterion holds up to the critical temperature of
the model, and we also obtain precise asymptotics on the decay of the
log-Sobolev constant when approaching the critical point. The criterion also
applies to ``diluted'' mean-field models defined on sufficiently dense,
possibly random graphs. We further generalize the criterion to non-quadratic
interactions that admit a mode decomposition. The mode decomposition is
different from the scale decomposition of the Polchinski flow we used for
short-range spin systems.

## Solving rescheduling problems in heterogeneous urban railway networks using hybrid quantum-classical approach

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06763v7
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We address the applicability of a hybrid quantum-classical heuristics for
practical railway rescheduling management problems. We build an integer linear
programming model and solve it with D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver
(CQM) as well as with CPLEX, for comparison. The proposed approach is
demonstrated on a real-life heterogeneous urban network in Poland, including
both single- and multi-track segments. All the requirements posed by the
operator of the network are included in the model. The computational results
demonstrate the readiness for application and the benefits of quantum-classical
hybrid solvers in a realistic railway scenario: they yield acceptable solutions
on time, which is a critical requirement in a rescheduling situation. In
particular, CQM as a probabilistic heuristic solver provides a number of
feasible, close-to-optimal solutions the dispatcher can choose from.

## The Möbius game and other Bell tests for relativity

**Categories:** gr-qc, quant-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15752v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We derive multiparty games that, if the winning chance exceeds a certain
limit, prove the incompatibility of the parties' causal relations with any
partial order. This, in turn, means that the parties exert a back-action on the
causal relations; the causal relations are dynamical. The games turn out to be
representable by directed graphs, for instance by an orientation of the
M\"obius ladder. We discuss these games as device-independent tests of
spacetime's dynamical nature in general relativity. To do so, we design
relativistic settings where, in the Minkowski spacetime, the winning chance is
bound to the limits. In contrast, we find otherwise tame processes with
classical control of causal order that win the games deterministically. These
suggest a violation of the bounds in gravitational implementations. We obtain
these games by uncovering a "pairwise central symmetry" of the correlations in
question. This symmetry allows us to recycle the facets of the acyclic subgraph
polytope studied by Gr\"otschel, J\"unger, and Reinelt in the mid-80s for
combinatorial optimization. In addition, we derive multiparty games in a
scenario where the polytope dimension grows only linearly in the number of
parties. Here, exceeding the limits not only proves the dynamical nature of the
causal relations, but also that the correlations are incompatible with any
global causal order.

**Abstract:**
This paper explores the use of Grover's Algorithm in the classical rainbow

with conventional cryptographic methods to develop a Quantum Rainbow Table
Proof-of-Concept. This leverages on Quantum concepts and algorithms which
includes the principle of qubit superposition, entanglement and teleportation,
coupled with Grover's Algorithm to enable a more efficient search through the
rainbow table. The paper also details on the hardware constraints and the work
around to produce better results in the implementation stages. Through this
work we develop a working prototype of quantum rainbow table and demonstrate
how quantum computing could significantly improve the speed of cyber tools such
as password crackers and thus impact the cyber security landscape.

What is fundamentally quantum? We argue that most of the features, problems,

and its proposed solutions, single particle nonlocality, and no-cloning --
allegedly attributed to quantum physics have a classical analogue if one is to
interpret classical physics as fundamentally indeterministic. What really
characterizes non-classical effects are incompatible physical quantities,
which, in quantum quantum theory are associated to the fundamental constant
$\hbar$.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12660v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize multiple fields by
solving complex problems that can not be solved in reasonable time with current
classical computers. Nevertheless, the development of quantum computers is
still in its early stages and the available systems have still very limited
resources. As such, currently, the most practical way to develop and test
quantum algorithms is to use classical simulators of quantum computers. In
addition, the development of new quantum computers and their components also
depends on simulations.
  Given the characteristics of a quantum computer, their simulation is a very
demanding application in terms of both computation and memory. As such,
simulations do not scale well in current classical systems. Thus different
optimization and approximation techniques need to be applied at different
levels.
  This review provides an overview of the components of a quantum computer, the
levels at which these components and the whole quantum computer can be
simulated, and an in-depth analysis of different state-of-the-art acceleration
approaches. Besides the optimizations that can be performed at the algorithmic
level, this review presents the most promising hardware-aware optimizations and
future directions that can be explored for improving the performance and
scalability of the simulations.

## Second-order correlation and squeezing of photons in cavities with ultrastrong magnon-photon interactions

**Categories:** cond-mat.mes-hall, quant-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18512v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We investigate the second-order photon correlation function in cavity-magnon
systems, focusing on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities within the
ultrastrong coupling regime, and extending beyond the rotating-wave
approximation. By deriving exact integral solutions for the second-order
correlation function, we demonstrate that counter-rotating magnon-photon
interactions induce quadrature squeezing in the cavity mode. Furthermore, we
show that tuning the anisotropic magnon-cavity couplings enhances the squeezing
effect by changing the level repulsion of the magnon-cavity photon hybrid mode
without increasing the cavity photon occupation number. Our study reveals
distinct quantum correlation behaviors in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
cavities: For ferromagnetic cavities, we show that squeezing increases with
coupling strength asymmetry, whereas in the antiferromagnetic case, magnon
modes with opposite chirality suppress quantum effects and impose a lower bound
on correlation functions. These findings provide a pathway to optimize photon
blockade for quantum information technology in magnon-cavity systems in the
ultrastrong coupling limit.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06682v2

**Abstract:**
Superpositions of handed molecular states give rise to achiral eigenstates,
delocalized across a double-well potential via tunneling. A coherent
superposition of these energy eigenstates could dynamically relocalize the
molecules into chiral states, which has only been addressed theoretically.
Here, we present a microwave six-wave mixing pump-probe study to create and
probe coherent chiral tunneling dynamics in a rotational state. Through a
time-resolved scheme, we uncover the periodic time evolution of the induced
chiral wavepacket under field-free conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate precise
phase control of this coherence via phase modulation during pump excitation.

**Abstract:**
Light bosons, beyond the standard model and as prominent candidates for dark
matter, can mediate velocity and spin dependent exotic interaction between
electron spins and nucleons. At short ranges, it remains an open challenge to
test this exotic interaction with high precision. Here, we present a method
based on diamagnetic-levitated force sensor to detect the exotic interaction at
the millimeter scale. Improved constraints for the coupling $g_A^e g_V^N$ are
established, within the force range spanning from 0.15 mm to 1.5 mm. And the
constraint $|g_A^e g_V^N| \leq 4.39 \times10^{-26}$ at $\lambda$ = 0.5 mm at
the $95 \%$ confidence level, significantly surpasses previous results by more
than three orders of magnitude. The diamagnetic levitation force measurement
system developed here can also be repurposed to probe other exotic
spin-dependent interactions, such as the exotic spin-spin interaction. This
system provides a platform for the exploration of dark matter.

## Experimental Measurement of Non-Hermitian Left Eigenvectors

**Authors:** Xulong Wang, Guancong Ma
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.class-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23867v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The duality of left and right eigenvectors underpins the comprehensive
understanding of many physical phenomena. In Hermitian systems, left and right
eigenvectors are simply Hermitian-conjugate pairs. Non-Hermitian eigenstates in
contrast, have left and right eigenvectors that are distinct from each other.
However, despite the tremendous interest in non-Hermitian physics in recent
years, the roles of non-Hermitian left eigenvectors (LEVs) are still
inadequately explored-their physical consequences and observable effects remain
elusive, so much so that LEVs seem largely like an object of primarily
mathematical purpose. In this study, we present a method based on the
non-Hermitian Green's function for directly retrieving both LEVs and REVs from
experimentally measured steady-state responses. We validate the effectiveness
of this approach in two separate acoustic experiments: one characterizes the
non-Hermitian Berry phase, and the other measures extended topological modes.
Our results not only unambiguously demonstrate observable effects related to
non-Hermitian LEVs, but also highlight the under-appreciated role of LEVs in
non-Hermitian phenomena.

## Contrasting exchange-field and spin-transfer torque driving mechanisms in all-electric electron spin resonance

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24046v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Understanding the coherent properties of electron spins driven by electric
fields is crucial for their potential application in quantum-coherent
nanoscience. In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in
electric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning
tunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single
orbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage
modulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master
equation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two
distinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity,
electron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven
mechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold
spin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity
drives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum
spin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin
accumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin
resonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which
driving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing
quantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24107v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Column generation (CG) has been used to solve constrained 0-1 quadratic
programming problems. The pricing problem, which is iteratively solved in CG,
can be reduced to an unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem, allowing
for the efficient application of quantum annealing (QA). The solutions obtained
by CG are continuous relaxations, which cannot be practically used as feasible
0-1 solutions. This study proposes a post-processing method for constructing
feasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained through CG.
Numerical experiments on randomly generated problems demonstrate that CG with
the proposed post-processing yields solutions comparable to commercial solvers
with significantly reduced computation time.

## Position-Momenta Uncertainties in Classical Systems

**Abstract:**
We design a thermal bath that preserves the conservation of a system's
angular momentum or allows it to fluctuate around a specified nonzero mean
while maintaining a Boltzmann distribution of energy in the steady state.We
demonstrate that classical particles immersed in such baths exhibit
position-momentum uncertainties with a strictly positive lower bound
proportional to the absolute value of the mean angular momentum. The
proportionality constant, $c$, is dimensionless and independent of the system's
parameters. Remarkably, while $c$ is universally bounded by unity, it attains
the exact value $c=1/2$ for particles in central potentials.

## Berry Phase in Non-Perturbative QED

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24194v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We study QED$_4$ in the adiabatic approximation, incorporating global
topological effects associated with the $U(1)$ Berry connection. The Berry
phase accumulated by the fermionic vacuum is given by $\Delta \alpha =
\oint_{\mathcal{C}} \gamma_5\, \mathcal{A}^{(n)}$, where $\mathcal{A}^{(n)}$ is
a closed but non-exact one-form defined over the space of gauge configurations.
This chiral holonomy induces an emergent vacuum angle that contributes
non-perturbatively to the effective action. The partition function decomposes
into topological sectors weighted by this geometric phase, analogous to quantum
systems on multiply connected spaces. Our results reveal that even in Abelian
gauge theory, the infrared regime can exhibit global effects beyond the reach
of local or perturbative descriptions.

## A Quantum Walk Inspired Qubit Lattice Algorithm for Simulating Electromagnetic Wave Propagation and Scattering in Conservative and Dissipative Magnetized Plasmas

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24211v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Based on the Dirac representation of Maxwell equations we present an
explicit, discrete space-time, quantum walk-inspired algorithm suitable for
simulating the electromagnetic wave propagation and scattering from
inhomogeneities within magnetized plasmas. The quantum walk is implemented on a
lattice with an internal space of $n_q=4$--qubits, used to encode the classical
field amplitudes. Unitary rotation gates operate within this internal space to
generate the non-trivial dynamics of the free plasma-Dirac equation. To
incorporate the contributions from the cyclotron and plasma density
terms--manifesting as inhomogeneous potential terms--in the plasma-Dirac
equation, the walk process is complemented with unitary potential operators.
This leads to a unitary qubit lattice sequence that recovers the plasma-Dirac
equation under a second-order accurate discretization scheme. The proposed
algorithm is explicit and demonstrates, in the worst case, a polynomial quantum
advantage compared to the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) classical method
in terms of resource requirements and error complexity. In addition, we extend
the algorithm to include dissipative effects by introducing a phenomenological
collision frequency between plasma species. Then, a post-selective
time-marching implementation scheme is delineated, featuring a non-vanishing
overall success probability and, subsequently, eliminating the need for
amplitude amplification of the output state while preserving the quantum
advantage.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24276v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using
synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum
computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high
precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase
transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated
in data post-processing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We
present a readout error mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli
measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The
proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is
scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient
characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures
(POVMs), using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of
the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100
qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting
qubits.

**Abstract:**
Optimization approaches are ubiquitous in physics. In optics, they are key to
manipulating light through complex media, enabling applications ranging from
imaging to photonic simulators. In most demonstrations, however, the
optimization process is implemented using classical coherent light, leading to
a purely classical solution. Here we introduce the concept of optical
non-classical optimization in complex media. We experimentally demonstrate the
control and refocusing of non-classical light -- namely, entangled photon pairs
-- through a scattering medium by directly optimizing the output coincidence
rate. The optimal solutions found with this approach differ from those obtained
using classical optimization, a result of entanglement in the input state.
Beyond imaging, this genuinely non-classical optimization method has potential
to tackle complex problems, as we show by simulating a spin-glass model with
multi-spin interactions.

## Advanced Quantum Annealing Approach to Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows

**Abstract:**
In this paper, we explore the potential for quantum annealing to solve
realistic routing problems. We focus on two NP-Hard problems, including the
Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows and the Capacitated Vehicle
Routing Problem with Time Windows. We utilize D-Wave's Quantum Annealer and
Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM) solver within a hybrid framework to solve
these problems. We demonstrate that while the CQM solver effectively minimizes
route costs, it struggles to maintain time window feasibility as the problem
size increases. To address this limitation, we implement a heuristic method
that fixes infeasible solutions through a series of swapping operations.
Testing on benchmark instances shows our method achieves promising results with
an average optimality gap of 3.86%.

## Critical quantum metrology using non-Hermitian spin model with RT-symmetry

**Abstract:**
The non-Hermitian transverse XY model with
Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interaction having RT-symmetry,
referred to as iKSEA model, possesses both an exceptional point at which
eigenvectors coalesce and a quantum critical point where gap-closing occurs. To
precisely estimate the magnetic field of the system, we prove that the quantum
Fisher information (QFI) of the ground state of the iKSEA model, which is a
lower bound of the precision quantified by the root mean square error, scales
as $N^2$, with N being the system-size. This provides Heisenberg scaling both
at the quantum critical point and the exceptional point in the thermodynamic
limit. It indicates that when the system is in contact with the bath, resulting
in this non-Hermitian model, reservoir engineering can provide enhanced
precision of system parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate analytically that,
in contrast to Hermitian systems, QFI surpasses the Heisenberg limit and
achieves super-Heisenberg scaling ($\sim N^6$), when the strength of the KSEA
interaction approaches the anisotropy parameter, permitting competition between
non-hermiticity and hermiticity features, as long as the system size is
moderate.

exemplified by solid-state defects. Molecular systems provide a complementary,
chemically tunable, platform for room-temperature optically detected magnetic
resonance (ODMR)-based quantum sensing. A critical parameter governing sensing
sensitivity is the optical contrast-i.e., the difference in emission between
two spin states. In state-of-the-art solid-state defects such as the
nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, this contrast is approximately 30%. Here,
capitalizing on chemical tunability, we show that room-temperature ODMR
contrasts of 40% can be achieved in molecules. Using a nitrogen-substituted
analogue of pentacene (6,13-diazapentacene), we enhance contrast compared to
pentacene and, by determining the triplet kinetics through time-dependent
pulsed ODMR, show how this arises from accelerated anisotropic intersystem
crossing. Furthermore, we translate high-contrast room-temperature pulsed ODMR
to self-assembled nanocrystals. Overall, our findings highlight the synthetic
handles available to optically readable molecular spins and the opportunities
to capitalize on chemical tunability for room-temperature quantum sensing.

## Quench dynamics via recursion method and dynamical quantum phase transitions

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum
many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis, which is recursively constructed
within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that
the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth
hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport
coefficients at infinite temperature. In this work, we extend the scope of the
recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method
to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we
find a clear evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by
the dynamical quantum phase transition.

## Radiative corrections to the $R$ and $R^2$ invariants from torsion fluctuations on maximally symmetric spaces

**Authors:** Riccardo Martini, Gregorio Paci, Dario Sauro

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16681v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We derive the runnings of the $R$ and $R^2$ operators that stem from
integrating out quantum torsion fluctuations on a maximally symmetric Euclidean
background, while treating the metric as a classical field. Our analysis is
performed in a manifestly covariant way, exploiting both the
recently-introduced spin-parity decomposition of torsion perturbations and the
heat kernel technique. The Lagrangian we start with is the most general one for
1-loop computations on maximally symmetric backgrounds involving kinetic terms
and couplings to the scalar curvature that is compatible with a gauge-like
symmetry for the torsion. The latter removes the twice-longitudinal vector mode
from the spectrum, and it yields operators of maximum rank four. We also
examine the conditions required to avoid ghost instabilities and ensure the
validity of our assumption to neglect metric quantum fluctuations,
demonstrating the compatibility between these two assumptions. Then, we use our
findings in the context of Starobinsky's inflation to calculate the
contributions from the torsion tensor to the $\beta$-function of the $R^2$
term. While this result is quantitatively reliable only at the $0$-th order in
the slow-roll parameters or during the very early stages of inflation -- due to
the background choice -- it qualitatively illustrates how to incorporate
quantum effects of torsion in the path integral formalism.

## Teola: Towards End-to-End Optimization of LLM-based Applications

**Authors:** Xin Tan, Yimin Jiang, Yitao Yang, Hong Xu
**Categories:** cs.DC, cs.AI, cs.NI
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00326v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Large language model (LLM)-based applications consist of both LLM and non-LLM
components, each contributing to the end-to-end latency. Despite great efforts
to optimize LLM inference, end-to-end workflow optimization has been
overlooked. Existing frameworks employ coarse-grained orchestration with task
modules, which confines optimizations to within each module and yields
suboptimal scheduling decisions. We propose fine-grained end-to-end
orchestration, which utilizes task primitives as the basic units and represents
each query's workflow as a primitive-level dataflow graph. This explicitly
exposes a much larger design space, enables optimizations in parallelization
and pipelining across primitives of different modules, and enhances scheduling
to improve application-level performance. We build Teola, a novel orchestration
framework for LLM-based applications that implements this scheme. Comprehensive
experiments show that Teola can achieve up to 2.09x speedup over existing
systems across various popular LLM applications. The code is available at

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14846v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Head and neck tumors and metastatic lymph nodes are crucial for treatment
planning and prognostic analysis. Accurate segmentation and quantitative
analysis of these structures require pixel-level annotation, making automated
segmentation techniques essential for the diagnosis and treatment of head and
neck cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of multiple strategies
on the segmentation of pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) and mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT)
images. For the segmentation of pre-RT images, we utilized: 1) a fully
supervised learning approach, and 2) the same approach enhanced with
pre-trained weights and the MixUp data augmentation technique. For mid-RT
images, we introduced a novel computational-friendly network architecture that
features separate encoders for mid-RT images and registered pre-RT images with
their labels. The mid-RT encoder branch integrates information from pre-RT
images and labels progressively during the forward propagation. We selected the
highest-performing model from each fold and used their predictions to create an
ensemble average for inference. In the final test, our models achieved a
segmentation performance of 82.38% for pre-RT and 72.53% for mid-RT on
aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) as HiLab. Our code is available at

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Identifying vulnerabilities in source code is crucial, especially in critical
software components. Existing methods such as static analysis, dynamic
analysis, formal verification, and recently Large Language Models are widely
used to detect security flaws. This paper introduces CASTLE (CWE Automated
Security Testing and Low-Level Evaluation), a benchmarking framework for
evaluating the vulnerability detection capabilities of different methods. We
assess 13 static analysis tools, 10 LLMs, and 2 formal verification tools using
a hand-crafted dataset of 250 micro-benchmark programs covering 25 common CWEs.
We propose the CASTLE Score, a novel evaluation metric to ensure fair
comparison. Our results reveal key differences: ESBMC (a formal verification
tool) minimizes false positives but struggles with vulnerabilities beyond model
checking, such as weak cryptography or SQL injection. Static analyzers suffer
from high false positives, increasing manual validation efforts for developers.
LLMs perform exceptionally well in the CASTLE dataset when identifying
vulnerabilities in small code snippets. However, their accuracy declines, and
hallucinations increase as the code size grows. These results suggest that LLMs
could play a pivotal role in future security solutions, particularly within
code completion frameworks, where they can provide real-time guidance to
prevent vulnerabilities. The dataset is accessible at

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens
new ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcend the
process of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information
systems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core,
autonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows
to perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we elaborate on the concept
of autonomous GIS and present a framework that defines its five autonomous
goals, five levels of autonomy, five core functions, and three operational
scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial data
retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS
agents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research
directions, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision cores, autonomous
modeling, and examining the ethical and practical implications of autonomous
GIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this
paper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to
autonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance solutions to pressing global
challenges.

## KOFFVQA: An Objectively Evaluated Free-form VQA Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models in the Korean Language

**Authors:** Yoonshik Kim, Jaeyoon Jung
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23730v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The recent emergence of Large Vision-Language Models(VLMs) has resulted in a
variety of different benchmarks for evaluating such models. Despite this, we
observe that most existing evaluation methods suffer from the fact that they
either require the model to choose from pre-determined responses, sacrificing
open-endedness, or evaluate responses using a judge model, resulting in
subjective and unreliable evaluation. In addition, we observe a lack of
benchmarks for VLMs in the Korean language, which are necessary as a separate
metric from more common English language benchmarks, as the performance of
generative language models can differ significantly based on the language being
used. Therefore, we present KOFFVQA, a general-purpose free-form visual
question answering benchmark in the Korean language for the evaluation of VLMs.
Our benchmark consists of 275 carefully crafted questions each paired with an
image and grading criteria covering 10 different aspects of VLM performance.
The grading criteria eliminate the problem of unreliability by allowing the
judge model to grade each response based on a pre-determined set of rules. By
defining the evaluation criteria in an objective manner, even a small
open-source model can be used to evaluate models on our benchmark reliably. In
addition to evaluating a large number of existing VLMs on our benchmark, we
also experimentally verify that our method of using pre-existing grading
criteria for evaluation is much more reliable than existing methods. Our
evaluation code is available at https://github.com/maum-ai/KOFFVQA

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23731v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Purpose: Research has revealed that strength training can reduce the
incidence of chronic diseases and physical deterioration at any age. Therefore,
having a movement diagnostic system is crucial for training alone. Hence, this
study developed an artificial intelligence and computer vision-based barbell
squat coaching system with a real-time mode that immediately diagnoses the
issue and provides feedback after each squat. In addition, a replay mode allows
users to examine their previous squats and check their comments. Initially,
four primary characteristics of the barbell squat were identified: body joint
angles, dorsiflexion, the ratio of knee-to-hip movement, and barbell stability.
Methods: We collect 8,151 squats from 77 participants, categorizing them as
good squats and six issues. Then, we trained the diagnosis models with three
machine-learning architectures. Furthermore, this research applied the SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to enhance the accuracy of issue prediction
and reduce the computation time by feature selection. Results: The F1 score of
the six issues reached 86.86%, 69.01%, 77.42%, 90.74%, 95.83%, and 100%. Each
squat diagnosis took less than 0.5 seconds. Finally, this study examined the
efficacy of the proposed system with two groups of participants trained with
and without the system. Subsequently, participants trained with the system
exhibited substantial improvements in their squat technique, as assessed both
by the system itself and by a professional weightlifting coach. Conclusion:
This is a comprehensive study that integrates artificial intelligence, computer
vision and multivariable processing technologies, aimed at building a
real-time, user-friendly barbell squat feedback and training system.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23875v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The development of control policies for multi-robot systems traditionally
follows a complex and labor-intensive process, often lacking the flexibility to
adapt to dynamic tasks. This has motivated research on methods to automatically
create control policies. However, these methods require iterative processes of
manually crafting and refining objective functions, thereby prolonging the
development cycle. This work introduces \textit{GenSwarm}, an end-to-end system
that leverages large language models to automatically generate and deploy
control policies for multi-robot tasks based on simple user instructions in
natural language. As a multi-language-agent system, GenSwarm achieves zero-shot
learning, enabling rapid adaptation to altered or unseen tasks. The white-box
nature of the code policies ensures strong reproducibility and
interpretability. With its scalable software and hardware architectures,
GenSwarm supports efficient policy deployment on both simulated and real-world
multi-robot systems, realizing an instruction-to-execution end-to-end
functionality that could prove valuable for robotics specialists and
non-specialists alike.The code of the proposed GenSwarm system is available
online: https://github.com/WindyLab/GenSwarm.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The deployment of Machine Learning models at cloud have grown by tech
companies. Hardware requirements are higher when these models involve Deep
Learning (DL) techniques and the cloud providers' costs may be a barrier. We
explore deploying DL models using for experiments the GECToR model, a DL
solution for Grammatical Error Correction, across three of the major cloud
platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). We evaluate real-time latency, hardware
usage and cost at each cloud provider by 7 execution environments with 10
experiments reproduced. We found that while GPUs excel in performance, they had
an average cost 300% higher than solutions without GPU. Our analysis also
identifies that processor cache size is crucial for cost-effective CPU
deployments, enabling over 50% of cost reduction compared to GPUs. This study
demonstrates the feasibility and affordability of cloud-based DL inference
solutions without GPUs, benefiting resource-constrained users like startups.

## DiET-GS: Diffusion Prior and Event Stream-Assisted Motion Deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting

**Authors:** Seungjun Lee, Gim Hee Lee

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24210v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Reconstructing sharp 3D representations from blurry multi-view images are
long-standing problem in computer vision. Recent works attempt to enhance
high-quality novel view synthesis from the motion blur by leveraging
event-based cameras, benefiting from high dynamic range and microsecond
temporal resolution. However, they often reach sub-optimal visual quality in
either restoring inaccurate color or losing fine-grained details. In this
paper, we present DiET-GS, a diffusion prior and event stream-assisted motion
deblurring 3DGS. Our framework effectively leverages both blur-free event
streams and diffusion prior in a two-stage training strategy. Specifically, we
introduce the novel framework to constraint 3DGS with event double integral,
achieving both accurate color and well-defined details. Additionally, we
propose a simple technique to leverage diffusion prior to further enhance the
edge details. Qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic and
real-world data demonstrate that our DiET-GS is capable of producing
significantly better quality of novel views compared to the existing baselines.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24228v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In e-commerce, behavioral data is collected for decision making which can be
costly and slow. Simulation with LLM powered agents is emerging as a promising
alternative for representing human population behavior. However, LLMs are known
to exhibit certain biases, such as brand bias, review rating bias and limited
representation of certain groups in the population, hence they need to be
carefully benchmarked and aligned to user behavior. Ultimately, our goal is to
synthesise an agent population and verify that it collectively approximates a
real sample of humans. To this end, we propose a framework that: (i) creates
synthetic shopping agents by automatically mining personas from anonymised
historical shopping data, (ii) equips agents with retail-specific tools to
synthesise shopping sessions and (iii) introduces a novel alignment suite
measuring distributional differences between humans and shopping agents at the
group (i.e. population) level rather than the traditional "individual" level.
Experimental results demonstrate that using personas improves performance on
the alignment suite, though a gap remains to human behaviour. We showcase an
initial application of our framework for automated agentic A/B testing and
compare the findings to human results. Finally, we discuss applications,
limitations and challenges setting the stage for impactful future work.

## Pro-Routing: Proactive Routing of Autonomous Multi-Capacity Robots for Pickup-and-Delivery Tasks

**Authors:** Daniel Garces, Stephanie Gil
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.MA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24325v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We consider a multi-robot setting, where we have a fleet of multi-capacity
autonomous robots that must service spatially distributed pickup-and-delivery
requests with fixed maximum wait times. Requests can be either scheduled ahead
of time or they can enter the system in real-time. In this setting, stability
for a routing policy is defined as the cost of the policy being uniformly
bounded over time. Most previous work either solve the problem offline to
theoretically maintain stability or they consider dynamically arriving requests
at the expense of the theoretical guarantees on stability. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by proposing a novel proactive rollout-based routing
framework that adapts to real-time demand while still provably maintaining the
stability of the learned routing policy. We derive provable stability
guarantees for our method by proposing a fleet sizing algorithm that obtains a
sufficiently large fleet that ensures stability by construction. To validate
our theoretical results, we consider a case study on real ride requests for
Harvard's evening Van System. We also evaluate the performance of our framework
using the currently deployed smaller fleet size. In this smaller setup, we
compare against the currently deployed routing algorithm, greedy heuristics,
and Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search-based algorithms. Our empirical results show that
our framework maintains stability when we use the sufficiently large fleet size
found in our theoretical results. For the smaller currently deployed fleet
size, our method services 6% more requests than the closest baseline while
reducing median passenger wait times by 33%.

## Interpretable Few-shot Learning with Online Attribute Selection

**Authors:** Mohammad Reza Zarei, Majid Komeili
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09107v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Few-shot learning (FSL) presents a challenging learning problem in which only
a few samples are available for each class. Decision interpretation is more
important in few-shot classification due to a greater chance of error compared
to traditional classification. However, the majority of the previous FSL
methods are black-box models. In this paper, we propose an inherently
interpretable model for FSL based on human-friendly attributes. Previously,
human-friendly attributes have been utilized to train models with the potential
for human interaction and interpretability. However, such approaches are not
directly extendible to the few-shot classification scenario. Moreover, we
propose an online attribute selection mechanism to effectively filter out
irrelevant attributes in each episode. The attribute selection mechanism
improves accuracy and helps with interpretability by reducing the number of
attributes that participate in each episode. We further propose a mechanism
that automatically detects the episodes where the pool of available
human-friendly attributes is insufficient, and subsequently augments it by
engaging some learned unknown attributes. We demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves results on par with black-box few-shot learning models on four
widely used datasets. We also empirically evaluate the level of decision
alignment between different models and human understanding and show that our
model outperforms the comparison methods based on this criterion.

## Emergent representations in networks trained with the Forward-Forward algorithm

**Categories:** cs.NE, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18353v4
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The Backpropagation algorithm has often been criticised for its lack of
biological realism. In an attempt to find a more biologically plausible
alternative, the recently introduced Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the
forward and backward passes of Backpropagation with two forward passes. In this
work, we show that the internal representations obtained by the Forward-Forward
algorithm can organise into category-specific ensembles exhibiting high
sparsity -- composed of a low number of active units. This situation is
reminiscent of what has been observed in cortical sensory areas, where neuronal
ensembles are suggested to serve as the functional building blocks for
perception and action. Interestingly, while this sparse pattern does not
typically arise in models trained with standard Backpropagation, it can emerge
in networks trained with Backpropagation on the same objective proposed for the
Forward-Forward algorithm.

**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, 62-xx, 90-xx
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13073v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Heterogeneous datasets emerge in various machine learning and optimization
applications that feature different input sources, types or formats. Most
models or methods do not natively tackle heterogeneity. Hence, such datasets
are often partitioned into smaller and simpler ones, which may limit the
generalizability or performance, especially when data is limited. The first
main contribution of this work is a modeling framework that generalizes
hierarchical, tree-structured, variable-size or conditional search frameworks.
The framework models mixed-variable and hierarchical domains in which variables
may be continuous, integer, or categorical, with some identified as meta when
they influence the structure of the problem. The second main contribution is a
novel distance that compares any pair of mixed-variable points that do not
share the same variables, allowing to use whole heterogeneous datasets that
reside in mixed-variable and hierarchical domains with meta variables. The
contributions are illustrated through regression and classification experiments
using simple distance-based models applied to datasets of hyperparameters with
corresponding performance scores.

## SoftCVI: Contrastive variational inference with self-generated soft labels

**Authors:** Daniel Ward, Mark Beaumont, Matteo Fasiolo
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15687v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Estimating a distribution given access to its unnormalized density is pivotal
in Bayesian inference, where the posterior is generally known only up to an
unknown normalizing constant. Variational inference and Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods are the predominant tools for this task; however, both are often
challenging to apply reliably, particularly when the posterior has complex
geometry. Here, we introduce Soft Contrastive Variational Inference (SoftCVI),
which allows a family of variational objectives to be derived through a
contrastive estimation framework. The approach parameterizes a classifier in
terms of a variational distribution, reframing the inference task as a
contrastive estimation problem aiming to identify a single true posterior
sample among a set of samples. Despite this framing, we do not require positive
or negative samples, but rather learn by sampling the variational distribution
and computing ground truth soft classification labels from the unnormalized
posterior itself. The objectives have zero variance gradient when the
variational approximation is exact, without the need for specialized gradient
estimators. We empirically investigate the performance on a variety of Bayesian
inference tasks, using both simple (e.g. normal) and expressive (normalizing
flow) variational distributions. We find that SoftCVI can be used to form
objectives which are stable to train and mass-covering, frequently
outperforming inference with other variational approaches.

**Abstract:**
Discrete diffusion models have achieved success in tasks like image
generation and masked language modeling but face limitations in controlled
content editing. We introduce DICE (Discrete Inversion for Controllable
Editing), the first approach to enable precise inversion for discrete diffusion
models, including multinomial diffusion and masked generative models. By
recording noise sequences and masking patterns during the reverse diffusion
process, DICE enables accurate reconstruction and flexible editing of discrete
data without the need for predefined masks or attention manipulation. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of DICE across both image and text domains,
evaluating it on models such as VQ-Diffusion, Paella, and RoBERTa. Our results
show that DICE preserves high data fidelity while enhancing editing
capabilities, offering new opportunities for fine-grained content manipulation
in discrete spaces.

## Testing Support Size More Efficiently Than Learning Histograms

**Authors:** Renato Ferreira Pinto Jr., Nathaniel Harms
**Categories:** cs.DS, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18915v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Consider two problems about an unknown probability distribution $p$:
  1. How many samples from $p$ are required to test if $p$ is supported on $n$
elements or not? Specifically, given samples from $p$, determine whether it is
supported on at most $n$ elements, or it is "$\epsilon$-far" (in total
variation distance) from being supported on $n$ elements.
  2. Given $m$ samples from $p$, what is the largest lower bound on its support
size that we can produce?
  The best known upper bound for problem (1) uses a general algorithm for
learning the histogram of the distribution $p$, which requires
$\Theta(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon^2 \log n})$ samples. We show that testing can be
done more efficiently than learning the histogram, using only
$O(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon \log n} \log(1/\epsilon))$ samples, nearly matching the
best known lower bound of $\Omega(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon \log n})$. This algorithm
also provides a better solution to problem (2), producing larger lower bounds
on support size than what follows from previous work. The proof relies on an
analysis of Chebyshev polynomial approximations outside the range where they
are designed to be good approximations, and the paper is intended as an
accessible self-contained exposition of the Chebyshev polynomial method.

## Score-Based Metropolis-Hastings Algorithms

**Authors:** Ahmed Aloui, Ali Hasan, Juncheng Dong, Zihao Wu, Vahid Tarokh
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.CO
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00467v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this paper, we introduce a new approach for integrating score-based models
with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. While traditional score-based diffusion
models excel in accurately learning the score function from data points, they
lack an energy function, making the Metropolis-Hastings adjustment step
inaccessible. Consequently, the unadjusted Langevin algorithm is often used for
sampling using estimated score functions. The lack of an energy function then
prevents the application of the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and
other Metropolis-Hastings methods, limiting the wealth of other algorithms
developed that use acceptance functions. We address this limitation by
introducing a new loss function based on the \emph{detailed balance condition},
allowing the estimation of the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities
given a learned score function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for various scenarios, including sampling from heavy-tail
distributions.

Cryptocurrencies fluctuate in markets with high price volatility, posing
significant challenges for investors. To aid in informed decision-making,
systems predicting cryptocurrency market movements have been developed,
typically focusing on historical patterns. However, these methods often
overlook three critical factors influencing market dynamics: 1) the macro
investing environment, reflected in major cryptocurrency fluctuations affecting
collaborative investor behaviors; 2) overall market sentiment, heavily
influenced by news impacting investor strategies; and 3) technical indicators,
offering insights into overbought or oversold conditions, momentum, and market
trends, which are crucial for short-term price movements. This paper proposes a
dual prediction mechanism that forecasts the next day's closing price by
incorporating macroeconomic fluctuations, technical indicators, and individual
cryptocurrency price changes. Additionally, a novel refinement mechanism
enhances predictions through market sentiment-based rescaling and fusion.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming ten comparison methods.

**Abstract:**
The rapid growth of the global population and the continuous decline in
cultivable land pose significant threats to food security. This challenge
worsens as climate change further reduces the availability of farmland.
Soilless agriculture, such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, offers a
sustainable solution by enabling efficient crop cultivation in controlled
environments. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart
precision farming improves resource efficiency, automates environmental
control, and ensures stable and high-yield crop production. IoT-enabled smart
farming systems utilize real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and
automation to optimize water and nutrient usage while minimizing human
intervention. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges of IoT-based
soilless farming, highlighting its role in sustainable agriculture, urban
farming, and global food security. These advanced farming methods ensure
greater productivity, resource conservation, and year-round cultivation.
However, they also face challenges such as high initial investment,
technological dependency, and energy consumption. Through a comprehensive
study, bibliometric analysis, and comparative analysis, this research
highlights current trends and research gaps. It also outlines future directions
for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to drive innovation
and scalability in IoT-driven soilless agriculture. By emphasizing the benefits
of vertical farming and Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA)-enabled
soilless techniques, this paper supports informed decision-making to address
food security challenges and promote sustainable agricultural innovations.

## Self-Vocabularizing Training for Neural Machine Translation

**Authors:** Pin-Jie Lin, Ernie Chang
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13837v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Past vocabulary learning techniques identify relevant vocabulary before
training, relying on statistical and entropy-based assumptions that largely
neglect the role of model training. Empirically, we observe that trained
translation models are induced to use a byte-pair encoding (BPE) vocabulary
subset distinct from the original BPE vocabulary, leading to performance
improvements when retrained with the induced vocabulary. In this paper, we
analyze this discrepancy in neural machine translation by examining vocabulary
and entropy shifts during self-training--where each iteration generates a
labeled dataset by pairing source sentences with the model's predictions to
define a new vocabulary. Building on these insights, we propose
self-vocabularizing training, an iterative method that self-selects a smaller,
more optimal vocabulary, yielding up to a 1.49 BLEU improvement. Moreover, we
find that deeper model architectures lead to both an increase in unique token
usage and a 6-8% reduction in vocabulary size.

## Graph neural networks extrapolate out-of-distribution for shortest paths

**Authors:** Robert R. Nerem, Samantha Chen, Sanjoy Dasgupta, Yusu Wang

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19173v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Neural networks (NNs), despite their success and wide adoption, still
struggle to extrapolate out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., to inputs that are not
well-represented by their training dataset. Addressing the OOD generalization
gap is crucial when models are deployed in environments significantly different
from the training set, such as applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on
small graphs to large, real-world graphs. One promising approach for achieving
robust OOD generalization is the framework of neural algorithmic alignment,
which incorporates ideas from classical algorithms by designing neural
architectures that resemble specific algorithmic paradigms (e.g. dynamic
programming). The hope is that trained models of this form would have superior
OOD capabilities, in much the same way that classical algorithms work for all
instances. We rigorously analyze the role of algorithmic alignment in achieving
OOD generalization, focusing on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to the
canonical shortest path problem. We prove that GNNs, trained to minimize a
sparsity-regularized loss over a small set of shortest path instances, exactly
implement the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm for shortest paths. In fact, if a GNN
minimizes this loss within an error of $\epsilon$, it implements the BF
algorithm with an error of $O(\epsilon)$. Consequently, despite limited
training data, these GNNs are guaranteed to extrapolate to arbitrary
shortest-path problems, including instances of any size. Our empirical results
support our theory by showing that NNs trained by gradient descent are able to
minimize this loss and extrapolate in practice.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21788v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Structural biology relies on accurate three-dimensional biomolecular
structures to advance our understanding of biological functions, disease
mechanisms, and therapeutics. While recent advances in deep learning have
enabled the development of all-atom foundation models for molecular modeling
and generation, existing approaches face challenges in generalization due to
the multi-modal nature of atomic data and the lack of comprehensive analysis of
training and sampling strategies. To address these limitations, we propose
PharMolixFM, a unified framework for constructing all-atom foundation models
based on multi-modal generative techniques. Our framework includes three
variants using state-of-the-art multi-modal generative models. By formulating
molecular tasks as a generalized denoising process with task-specific priors,
PharMolixFM achieves robust performance across various structural biology
applications. Experimental results demonstrate that PharMolixFM-Diff achieves
competitive prediction accuracy in protein-small-molecule docking (83.9% vs.
90.2% RMSD < 2{\AA}, given pocket) with significantly improved inference speed.
Moreover, we explore the empirical inference scaling law by introducing more
sampling repeats or steps. Our code and model are available at
https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22370v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We introduce the sequential multi-object robotic grasp sampling algorithm
SeqGrasp that can robustly synthesize stable grasps on diverse objects using
the robotic hand's partial Degrees of Freedom (DoF). We use SeqGrasp to
construct the large-scale Allegro Hand sequential grasping dataset SeqDataset
and use it for training the diffusion-based sequential grasp generator
SeqDiffuser. We experimentally evaluate SeqGrasp and SeqDiffuser against the
state-of-the-art non-sequential multi-object grasp generation method MultiGrasp
in simulation and on a real robot. The experimental results demonstrate that
SeqGrasp and SeqDiffuser reach an 8.71%-43.33% higher grasp success rate than
MultiGrasp. Furthermore, SeqDiffuser is approximately 1000 times faster at
generating grasps than SeqGrasp and MultiGrasp.

## Learning a Single Index Model from Anisotropic Data with vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23642v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We investigate the problem of learning a Single Index Model (SIM)- a popular
model for studying the ability of neural networks to learn features - from
anisotropic Gaussian inputs by training a neuron using vanilla Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD). While the isotropic case has been extensively studied,
the anisotropic case has received less attention and the impact of the
covariance matrix on the learning dynamics remains unclear. For instance,
Mousavi-Hosseini et al. (2023b) proposed a spherical SGD that requires a
separate estimation of the data covariance matrix, thereby oversimplifying the
influence of covariance. In this study, we analyze the learning dynamics of
vanilla SGD under the SIM with anisotropic input data, demonstrating that
vanilla SGD automatically adapts to the data's covariance structure. Leveraging
these results, we derive upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity using
a notion of effective dimension that is determined by the structure of the
covariance matrix instead of the input data dimension.

**Abstract:**
Reinforcement learning (RL), with its ability to explore and optimize
policies in complex, dynamic decision-making tasks, has emerged as a promising
approach to addressing motion planning (MoP) challenges in autonomous driving
(AD). Despite rapid advancements in RL and AD, a systematic description and
interpretation of the RL design process tailored to diverse driving tasks
remains underdeveloped. This survey provides a comprehensive review of RL-based
MoP for AD, focusing on lessons from task-specific perspectives. We first
outline the fundamentals of RL methodologies, and then survey their
applications in MoP, analyzing scenario-specific features and task requirements
to shed light on their influence on RL design choices. Building on this
analysis, we summarize key design experiences, extract insights from various
driving task applications, and provide guidance for future implementations.
Additionally, we examine the frontier challenges in RL-based MoP, review recent
efforts to addresse these challenges, and propose strategies for overcoming
unresolved issues.

## Scalable Geometric Learning with Correlation-Based Functional Brain Networks

**Authors:** Kisung You, Hae-Jeong Park
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23653v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The correlation matrix is a central representation of functional brain
networks in neuroimaging. Traditional analyses often treat pairwise
interactions independently in a Euclidean setting, overlooking the intrinsic
geometry of correlation matrices. While earlier attempts have embraced the
quotient geometry of the correlation manifold, they remain limited by
computational inefficiency and numerical instability, particularly in
high-dimensional contexts. This paper presents a novel geometric framework that
employs diffeomorphic transformations to embed correlation matrices into a
Euclidean space, preserving salient manifold properties and enabling
large-scale analyses. The proposed method integrates with established learning
algorithms - regression, dimensionality reduction, and clustering - and extends
naturally to population-level inference of brain networks. Simulation studies
demonstrate both improved computational speed and enhanced accuracy compared to
conventional manifold-based approaches. Moreover, applications in real
neuroimaging scenarios illustrate the framework's utility, enhancing behavior
score prediction, subject fingerprinting in resting-state fMRI, and hypothesis
testing in electroencephalogram data. An open-source MATLAB toolbox is provided
to facilitate broader adoption and advance the application of correlation
geometry in functional brain network research.

## MKA: Leveraging Cross-Lingual Consensus for Model Abstention

**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23687v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Reliability of LLMs is questionable even as they get better at more tasks. A
wider adoption of LLMs is contingent on whether they are usably factual. And if
they are not, on whether they can properly calibrate their confidence in their
responses. This work focuses on utilizing the multilingual knowledge of an LLM
to inform its decision to abstain or answer when prompted. We develop a
multilingual pipeline to calibrate the model's confidence and let it abstain
when uncertain. We run several multilingual models through the pipeline to
profile them across different languages. We find that the performance of the
pipeline varies by model and language, but that in general they benefit from
it. This is evidenced by the accuracy improvement of $71.2\%$ for Bengali over
a baseline performance without the pipeline. Even a high-resource language like
English sees a $15.5\%$ improvement. These results hint at possible further
improvements.

## A Low-complexity Structured Neural Network to Realize States of Dynamical Systems

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23697v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Data-driven learning is rapidly evolving and places a new perspective on
realizing state-space dynamical systems. However, dynamical systems derived
from nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) suffer from limitations
in computational efficiency. Thus, this paper stems from data-driven learning
to advance states of dynamical systems utilizing a structured neural network
(StNN). The proposed learning technique also seeks to identify an optimal,
low-complexity operator to solve dynamical systems, the so-called Hankel
operator, derived from time-delay measurements. Thus, we utilize the StNN based
on the Hankel operator to solve dynamical systems as an alternative to existing
data-driven techniques. We show that the proposed StNN reduces the number of
parameters and computational complexity compared with the conventional neural
networks and also with the classical data-driven techniques, such as Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and Hankel Alternative view of
Koopman (HAVOK), which is commonly known as delay-Dynamic Mode
Decomposition(DMD) or Hankel-DMD. More specifically, we present numerical
simulations to solve dynamical systems utilizing the StNN based on the Hankel
operator beginning from the fundamental Lotka-Volterra model, where we compare
the StNN with the LEarning Across Dynamical Systems (LEADS), and extend our
analysis to highly nonlinear and chaotic Lorenz systems, comparing the StNN
with conventional neural networks, SINDy, and HAVOK. Hence, we show that the
proposed StNN paves the way for realizing state-space dynamical systems with a
low-complexity learning algorithm, enabling prediction and understanding of
future states.

## Steering Large Agent Populations using Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridges with Gaussian Mixture Models

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23705v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The Mean-Field Schrodinger Bridge (MFSB) problem is an optimization problem
aiming to find the minimum effort control policy to drive a McKean-Vlassov
stochastic differential equation from one probability measure to another. In
the context of multiagent control, the objective is to control the
configuration of a swarm of identical, interacting cooperative agents, as
captured by the time-varying probability measure of their state. Available
methods for solving this problem for distributions with continuous support rely
either on spatial discretizations of the problem's domain or on approximating
optimal solutions using neural networks trained through stochastic optimization
schemes. For agents following Linear Time-Varying dynamics, and for Gaussian
Mixture Model boundary distributions, we propose a highly efficient
parameterization to approximate the solutions of the corresponding MFSB in
closed form, without any learning steps. Our proposed approach consists of a
mixture of elementary policies, each solving a Gaussian-to-Gaussian Covariance
Steering problem from the components of the initial to the components of the
terminal mixture. Leveraging the semidefinite formulation of the Covariance
Steering problem, our proposed solver can handle probabilistic hard constraints
on the system's state, while maintaining numerical tractability. We illustrate
our approach on a variety of numerical examples.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23775v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The accuracy and reliability of vehicle localization on roads are crucial for
applications such as self-driving cars, toll systems, and digital tachographs.
To achieve accurate positioning, vehicles typically use global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) receivers to validate their absolute positions.
However, GNSS-based positioning can be compromised by interference signals,
necessitating the identification, classification, determination of purpose, and
localization of such interference to mitigate or eliminate it. Recent
approaches based on machine learning (ML) have shown superior performance in
monitoring interference. However, their feasibility in real-world applications
and environments has yet to be assessed. Effective implementation of ML
techniques requires training datasets that incorporate realistic interference
signals, including real-world noise and potential multipath effects that may
occur between transmitter, receiver, and satellite in the operational area.
Additionally, these datasets require reference labels. Creating such datasets
is often challenging due to legal restrictions, as causing interference to GNSS
sources is strictly prohibited. Consequently, the performance of ML-based
methods in practical applications remains unclear. To address this gap, we
describe a series of large-scale measurement campaigns conducted in real-world
settings at two highway locations in Germany and the Seetal Alps in Austria,
and in large-scale controlled indoor environments. We evaluate the latest
supervised ML-based methods to report on their performance in real-world
settings and present the applicability of pseudo-labeling for unsupervised
learning. We demonstrate the challenges of combining datasets due to data
discrepancies and evaluate outlier detection, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation techniques to present the models' capabilities to adapt to changes
in the datasets.

## Adaptive Attention-Based Model for 5G Radio-based Outdoor Localization

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23810v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Radio-based localization in dynamic environments, such as urban and vehicular
settings, requires systems that can efficiently adapt to varying signal
conditions and environmental changes. Factors such as multipath interference
and obstructions introduce different levels of complexity that affect the
accuracy of the localization. Although generalized models offer broad
applicability, they often struggle to capture the nuances of specific
environments, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world deployments. In
contrast, specialized models can be tailored to particular conditions, enabling
more precise localization by effectively handling domain-specific variations
and noise patterns. However, deploying multiple specialized models requires an
efficient mechanism to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario. In
this work, we develop an adaptive localization framework that combines shallow
attention-based models with a router/switching mechanism based on a
single-layer perceptron (SLP). This enables seamless transitions between
specialized localization models optimized for different conditions, balancing
accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to environmental variations.
We design three low-complex localization models tailored for distinct
scenarios, optimized for reduced computational complexity, test time, and model
size. The router dynamically selects the most suitable model based on real-time
input characteristics. The proposed framework is validated using real-world
vehicle localization data collected from a massive MIMO base station (BS),
demonstrating its ability to seamlessly adapt to diverse deployment conditions
while maintaining high localization accuracy.

## A Channel-Triggered Backdoor Attack on Wireless Semantic Image Reconstruction

**Authors:** Jialin Wan, Nan Cheng, Jinglong Shen
**Categories:** cs.CR, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23866v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Despite the transformative impact of deep learning (DL) on wireless
communication systems through data-driven end-to-end (E2E) learning, the
security vulnerabilities of these systems have been largely overlooked. Unlike
the extensively studied image domain, limited research has explored the threat
of backdoor attacks on the reconstruction of symbols in semantic communication
(SemCom) systems. Previous work has investigated such backdoor attacks at the
input level, but these approaches are infeasible in applications with strict
input control. In this paper, we propose a novel attack paradigm, termed
Channel-Triggered Backdoor Attack (CT-BA), where the backdoor trigger is a
specific wireless channel. This attack leverages fundamental physical layer
characteristics, making it more covert and potentially more threatening
compared to previous input-level attacks. Specifically, we utilize channel gain
with different fading distributions or channel noise with different power
spectral densities as potential triggers. This approach establishes
unprecedented attack flexibility as the adversary can select backdoor triggers
from both fading characteristics and noise variations in diverse channel
environments. Moreover, during the testing phase, CT-BA enables automatic
trigger activation through natural channel variations without requiring active
adversary participation. We evaluate the robustness of CT-BA on a ViT-based
Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) model across three datasets: MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. Furthermore, we apply CT-BA to three typical E2E SemCom
systems: BDJSCC, ADJSCC, and JSCCOFDM. Experimental results demonstrate that
our attack achieves near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining
effective stealth. Finally, we discuss potential defense mechanisms against
such attacks.

## Model Hemorrhage and the Robustness Limits of Large Language Models

**Authors:** Ziyang Ma, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang, Gui-Song Xia, Bo Du, Liangpei Zhang, Dacheng Tao
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23924v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across natural
language processing tasks, yet undergo significant performance degradation when
modified for deployment through quantization, pruning, or decoding strategy
adjustments. We define this phenomenon as model hemorrhage - performance
decline caused by parameter alterations and architectural changes. Through
systematic analysis of various LLM frameworks, we identify key vulnerability
patterns: layer expansion frequently disrupts attention mechanisms, compression
techniques induce information loss cascades, and decoding adjustments amplify
prediction divergences. Our investigation reveals transformer architectures
exhibit inherent robustness thresholds that determine hemorrhage severity
across modification types. We propose three mitigation strategies:
gradient-aware pruning preserves critical weight pathways, dynamic quantization
scaling maintains activation integrity, and decoding calibration aligns
generation trajectories with original model distributions. This work
establishes foundational metrics for evaluating model stability during
adaptation, providing practical guidelines for maintaining performance while
enabling efficient LLM deployment. Our findings advance understanding of neural
network resilience under architectural transformations, particularly for
large-scale language models.

## Detecting Localized Density Anomalies in Multivariate Data via Coin-Flip Statistics

**Authors:** Sebastian Springer, Andre Scaffidi, Maximilian Autenrieth, Gabriella Contardo, Alessandro Laio, Roberto Trotta, Heikki Haario
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23927v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Detecting localized density differences in multivariate data is a crucial
task in computational science. Such anomalies can indicate a critical system
failure, lead to a groundbreaking scientific discovery, or reveal unexpected
changes in data distribution. We introduce EagleEye, an anomaly detection
method to compare two multivariate datasets with the aim of identifying local
density anomalies, namely over- or under-densities affecting only localised
regions of the feature space. Anomalies are detected by modelling, for each
point, the ordered sequence of its neighbours' membership label as a
coin-flipping process and monitoring deviations from the expected behaviour of
such process. A unique advantage of our method is its ability to provide an
accurate, entirely unsupervised estimate of the local signal purity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets. In synthetic data, EagleEye accurately detects anomalies
in multiple dimensions even when they affect a tiny fraction of the data. When
applied to a challenging resonant anomaly detection benchmark task in simulated
Large Hadron Collider data, EagleEye successfully identifies particle decay
events present in just 0.3% of the dataset. In global temperature data,
EagleEye uncovers previously unidentified, geographically localised changes in
temperature fields that occurred in the most recent years. Thanks to its key
advantages of conceptual simplicity, computational efficiency, trivial
parallelisation, and scalability, EagleEye is widely applicable across many
fields.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23966v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Quantum or quantum-inspired Ising machines have recently shown promise in
solving combinatorial optimization problems in a short time. Real-world
applications, such as time division multiple access (TDMA) scheduling for
wireless multi-hop networks and financial trading, require solving those
problems sequentially where the size and characteristics change dynamically.
However, using Ising machines involves challenges to shorten system-wide
latency due to the transfer of large Ising model or the cloud access and to
determine the parameters for each problem. Here we show a combinatorial
optimization method using embedded Ising machines, which enables solving
diverse problems at high speed without runtime parameter tuning. We customize
the algorithm and circuit architecture of the simulated bifurcation-based Ising
machine to compress the Ising model and accelerate computation and then built a
machine learning model to estimate appropriate parameters using extensive
training data. In TDMA scheduling for wireless multi-hop networks, our
demonstration has shown that the sophisticated system can adapt to changes in
the problem and showed that it has a speed advantage over conventional methods.

**Abstract:**
Machine Learning algorithms are ubiquitous in key decision-making contexts
such as organizational justice or healthcare, which has spawned a great demand
for fairness in these procedures. In this paper we focus on the application of
fair ML in finance, more concretely on the use of fairness techniques on credit
scoring. This paper makes two contributions. On the one hand, it addresses the
existent gap concerning the application of established methods in the
literature to the case of multiple sensitive variables through the use of a new
technique called logical processors (LP). On the other hand, it also explores
the novel method of multistage processors (MP) to investigate whether the
combination of fairness methods can work synergistically to produce solutions
with improved fairness or accuracy. Furthermore, we examine the intersection of
these two lines of research by exploring the integration of fairness methods in
the multivariate case. The results are very promising and suggest that logical
processors are an appropriate way of handling multiple sensitive variables.
Furthermore, multistage processors are capable of improving the performance of
existing methods.

## Tree-Guided $L_1$-Convex Clustering

**Authors:** Bingyuan Zhang, Yoshikazu Terada
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.CO
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24012v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Convex clustering is a modern clustering framework that guarantees globally
optimal solutions and performs comparably to other advanced clustering methods.
However, obtaining a complete dendrogram (clusterpath) for large-scale datasets
remains computationally challenging due to the extensive costs associated with
iterative optimization approaches. To address this limitation, we develop a
novel convex clustering algorithm called Tree-Guided $L_1$-Convex Clustering
(TGCC). We first focus on the fact that the loss function of $L_1$-convex
clustering with tree-structured weights can be efficiently optimized using a
dynamic programming approach. We then develop an efficient cluster fusion
algorithm that utilizes the tree structure of the weights to accelerate the
optimization process and eliminate the issue of cluster splits commonly
observed in convex clustering. By combining the dynamic programming approach
with the cluster fusion algorithm, the TGCC algorithm achieves superior
computational efficiency without sacrificing clustering performance.
Remarkably, our TGCC algorithm can construct a complete clusterpath for $10^6$
points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ within 15 seconds on a standard laptop without the
need for parallel or distributed computing frameworks. Moreover, we extend the
TGCC algorithm to develop biclustering and sparse convex clustering algorithms.

## Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation with WordNet-Relaxed Text Embeddings for Robust Image Classification

**Authors:** Chenqi Guo, Mengshuo Rong, Qianli Feng, Rongfan Feng, Yinglong Ma
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24017v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Crossmodal knowledge distillation (KD) aims to enhance a unimodal student
using a multimodal teacher model. In particular, when the teacher's modalities
include the student's, additional complementary information can be exploited to
improve knowledge transfer. In supervised image classification, image datasets
typically include class labels that represent high-level concepts, suggesting a
natural avenue to incorporate textual cues for crossmodal KD. However, these
labels rarely capture the deeper semantic structures in real-world visuals and
can lead to label leakage if used directly as inputs, ultimately limiting KD
performance. To address these issues, we propose a multi-teacher crossmodal KD
framework that integrates CLIP image embeddings with learnable WordNet-relaxed
text embeddings under a hierarchical loss. By avoiding direct use of exact
class names and instead using semantically richer WordNet expansions, we
mitigate label leakage and introduce more diverse textual cues. Experiments
show that this strategy significantly boosts student performance, whereas noisy
or overly precise text embeddings hinder distillation efficiency.
Interpretability analyses confirm that WordNet-relaxed prompts encourage
heavier reliance on visual features over textual shortcuts, while still
effectively incorporating the newly introduced textual cues. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art or second-best results on six public datasets,
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing crossmodal KD.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Teleoperation is essential for autonomous robot learning, especially in
manipulation tasks that require human demonstrations or corrections. However,
most existing systems only offer unilateral robot control and lack the ability
to synchronize the robot's status with the teleoperation hardware, preventing
real-time, flexible intervention. In this work, we introduce HACTS
(Human-As-Copilot Teleoperation System), a novel system that establishes
bilateral, real-time joint synchronization between a robot arm and
teleoperation hardware. This simple yet effective feedback mechanism, akin to a
steering wheel in autonomous vehicles, enables the human copilot to intervene
seamlessly while collecting action-correction data for future learning.
Implemented using 3D-printed components and low-cost, off-the-shelf motors,
HACTS is both accessible and scalable. Our experiments show that HACTS
significantly enhances performance in imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement
learning (RL) tasks, boosting IL recovery capabilities and data efficiency, and
facilitating human-in-the-loop RL. HACTS paves the way for more effective and
interactive human-robot collaboration and data-collection, advancing the
capabilities of robot manipulation.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24071v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Vision Transformers (ViTs) are increasingly utilized in various computer
vision tasks due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, it
remains understudied how ViTs process information layer by layer. Numerous
studies have shown that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract features
of increasing complexity throughout their layers, which is crucial for tasks
like domain adaptation and transfer learning. ViTs, lacking the same inductive
biases as CNNs, can potentially learn global dependencies from the first layers
due to their attention mechanisms. Given the increasing importance of ViTs in
computer vision, there is a need to improve the layer-wise understanding of
ViTs. In this work, we present a novel, layer-wise analysis of concepts encoded
in state-of-the-art ViTs using neuron labeling. Our findings reveal that ViTs
encode concepts with increasing complexity throughout the network. Early layers
primarily encode basic features such as colors and textures, while later layers
represent more specific classes, including objects and animals. As the
complexity of encoded concepts increases, the number of concepts represented in
each layer also rises, reflecting a more diverse and specific set of features.
Additionally, different pretraining strategies influence the quantity and
category of encoded concepts, with finetuning to specific downstream tasks
generally reducing the number of encoded concepts and shifting the concepts to
more relevant categories.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24083v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Three-dimensional digital reconstruction of porous media presents a
fundamental challenge in geoscience, requiring simultaneous resolution of
fine-scale pore structures while capturing representative elementary volumes.
We introduce a computational framework that addresses this challenge through
latent diffusion models operating within the EDM framework. Our approach
reduces dimensionality via a custom variational autoencoder trained in binary
geological volumes, improving efficiency and also enabling the generation of
larger volumes than previously possible with diffusion models. A key innovation
is our controlled unconditional sampling methodology, which enhances
distribution coverage by first sampling target statistics from their empirical
distributions, then generating samples conditioned on these values. Extensive
testing on four distinct rock types demonstrates that conditioning on porosity
- a readily computable statistic - is sufficient to ensure a consistent
representation of multiple complex properties, including permeability,
two-point correlation functions, and pore size distributions. The framework
achieves better generation quality than pixel-space diffusion while enabling
significantly larger volume reconstruction (256-cube voxels) with substantially
reduced computational requirements, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
digital rock physics applications.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Image registration is fundamental in medical imaging, enabling precise
alignment of anatomical structures for diagnosis, treatment planning,
image-guided treatment or longitudinal monitoring. This work introduces IMPACT
(Image Metric with Pretrained model-Agnostic Comparison for Transmodality
registration), a generic semantic similarity metric designed for seamless
integration into diverse image registration frameworks (such as Elastix and
Voxelmorph). It compares deep learning-based features extracted from medical
images without requiring task-specific training, ensuring broad applicability
across various modalities. By leveraging the features of the large-scale
pretrained TotalSegmentator models and the ability to integrate Segment
Anything Model (SAM) and other large-scale segmentation networks, this approach
offers significant advantages. It provides robust, scalable, and efficient
solutions for multimodal image registration. The IMPACT loss was evaluated on
five challenging registration tasks involving thoracic CT/CBCT, and pelvic
MR/CT datasets. Quantitative metrics, such as Target Registration Error and
Dice Similarity Coefficient, demonstrated significant improvements in
anatomical alignment compared to baseline methods. Qualitative analyses further
confirmed the increased robustness of the proposed metric in the face of noise,
artifacts, and modality variations. IMPACT's versatility and efficiency make it
a valuable tool for advancing registration performance in clinical and research
applications, addressing critical challenges in multimodal medical imaging.

## It's a (Blind) Match! Towards Vision-Language Correspondence without Parallel Data

**Authors:** Dominik Schnaus, Nikita Araslanov, Daniel Cremers
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24129v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The platonic representation hypothesis suggests that vision and language
embeddings become more homogeneous as model and dataset sizes increase. In
particular, pairwise distances within each modality become more similar. This
suggests that as foundation models mature, it may become possible to match
vision and language embeddings in a fully unsupervised fashion, i.e. without
parallel data. We present the first feasibility study, and investigate
conformity of existing vision and language foundation models in the context of
unsupervised, or "blind", matching. First, we formulate unsupervised matching
as a quadratic assignment problem and introduce a novel heuristic that
outperforms previous solvers. We also develop a technique to find optimal
matching problems, for which a non-trivial match is very likely. Second, we
conduct an extensive study deploying a range of vision and language models on
four datasets. Our analysis reveals that for many problem instances, vision and
language representations can be indeed matched without supervision. This
finding opens up the exciting possibility of embedding semantic knowledge into
other modalities virtually annotation-free. As a proof of concept, we showcase
an unsupervised classifier, which achieves non-trivial classification accuracy
without any image-text annotation.

## Reinforcement Learning for Safe Autonomous Two Device Navigation of Cerebral Vessels in Mechanical Thrombectomy

**Authors:** Harry Robertshaw, Benjamin Jackson, Jiaheng Wang, Hadi Sadati, Lennart Karstensen, Alejandro Granados, Thomas C Booth
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.RO
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24140v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Purpose: Autonomous systems in mechanical thrombectomy (MT) hold promise for
reducing procedure times, minimizing radiation exposure, and enhancing patient
safety. However, current reinforcement learning (RL) methods only reach the
carotid arteries, are not generalizable to other patient vasculatures, and do
not consider safety. We propose a safe dual-device RL algorithm that can
navigate beyond the carotid arteries to cerebral vessels.
  Methods: We used the Simulation Open Framework Architecture to represent the
intricacies of cerebral vessels, and a modified Soft Actor-Critic RL algorithm
to learn, for the first time, the navigation of micro-catheters and
micro-guidewires. We incorporate patient safety metrics into our reward
function by integrating guidewire tip forces. Inverse RL is used with
demonstrator data on 12 patient-specific vascular cases.
  Results: Our simulation demonstrates successful autonomous navigation within
unseen cerebral vessels, achieving a 96% success rate, 7.0s procedure time, and
0.24 N mean forces, well below the proposed 1.5 N vessel rupture threshold.
  Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, our proposed autonomous system for
MT two-device navigation reaches cerebral vessels, considers safety, and is
generalizable to unseen patient-specific cases for the first time. We envisage
future work will extend the validation to vasculatures of different complexity
and on in vitro models. While our contributions pave the way towards deploying
agents in clinical settings, safety and trustworthiness will be crucial
elements to consider when proposing new methodology.

## Ride-Sourcing Vehicle Rebalancing with Service Accessibility Guarantees via Constrained Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Matej Jusup, Kenan Zhang, Zhiyuan Hu, Barna Pásztor, Andreas Krause, Francesco Corman
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.MA
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24183v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The rapid expansion of ride-sourcing services such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi
Chuxing has fundamentally reshaped urban transportation by offering flexible,
on-demand mobility via mobile applications. Despite their convenience, these
platforms confront significant operational challenges, particularly vehicle
rebalancing - the strategic repositioning of thousands of vehicles to address
spatiotemporal mismatches in supply and demand. Inadequate rebalancing results
in prolonged rider waiting times, inefficient vehicle utilization, and
inequitable distribution of services, leading to disparities in driver
availability and income.
  To tackle these complexities, we introduce scalable continuous-state
mean-field control (MFC) and reinforcement learning (MFRL) models that
explicitly represent each vehicle's precise location and employ continuous
repositioning actions guided by the distribution of other vehicles. To ensure
equitable service distribution, an accessibility constraint is integrated
within our optimal control formulation, balancing operational efficiency with
equitable access to the service across geographic regions. Our approach
acknowledges realistic conditions, including inherent stochasticity in
transitions, the simultaneous occurrence of vehicle-rider matching, vehicles'
rebalancing and cruising, and variability in rider behaviors. Crucially, we
relax the traditional mean-field assumption of equal supply-demand volume,
better reflecting practical scenarios. Extensive empirical evaluation using
real-world data-driven simulation of Shenzhen demonstrates the real-time
efficiency and robustness of our approach at the scale of tens of thousands of
vehicles.

## Traffic Engineering in Large-scale Networks with Generalizable Graph Neural Networks

**Authors:** Fangtong Zhou, Xiaorui Liu, Ruozhou Yu, Guoliang Xue
**Categories:** cs.NI, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24203v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Traffic engineering (TE) in large-scale computer networks has become a
fundamental yet challenging problem, owing to the swift growth of global-scale
cloud wide-area networks or backbone low-Earth-orbit satellite constellations.
To address the scalability issue of traditional TE algorithms, learning-based
approaches have been proposed, showing potential of significant efficiency
improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Nevertheless, the intrinsic
limitations of existing learning-based methods hinder their practical
application: they are not generalizable across diverse topologies and network
conditions, incur excessive training overhead, and do not respect link
capacities by default.
  This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE
problems efficiently in large-scale networks, while achieving superior
generalizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the
novel idea of transforming the problem of "predicting the optimal TE solution"
into "predicting the optimal TE algorithm", which enables TELGEN to learn and
efficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE
algorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact network topology or
traffic patterns, and can efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs
and generalize well to unseen topologies and demands.
  We trained and evaluated TELGEN on random and real-world networks with up to
5000 nodes and 106 links. TELGEN achieved less than 3% optimality gap while
ensuring feasibility in all cases, even when the test network had up to 20x
more nodes than the largest in training. It also saved up to 84% solving time
than classical optimal solver, and could reduce training time per epoch and
solving time by 2-4 orders of magnitude than latest learning algorithms on the
largest networks.

## A Comparison of Parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition Algorithms for Thermal-Hydraulics Applications

**Authors:** Stefano Riva, Andrea Missaglia, Carolina Introini, In Cheol Bang, Antonio Cammi
**Categories:** math.DS, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24205v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In recent years, algorithms aiming at learning models from available data
have become quite popular due to two factors: 1) the significant developments
in Artificial Intelligence techniques and 2) the availability of large amounts
of data. Nevertheless, this topic has already been addressed by methodologies
belonging to the Reduced Order Modelling framework, of which perhaps the most
famous equation-free technique is Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This algorithm
aims to learn the best linear model that represents the physical phenomena
described by a time series dataset: its output is a best state operator of the
underlying dynamical system that can be used, in principle, to advance the
original dataset in time even beyond its span. However, in its standard
formulation, this technique cannot deal with parametric time series, meaning
that a different linear model has to be derived for each parameter realization.
Research on this is ongoing, and some versions of a parametric Dynamic Mode
Decomposition already exist. This work contributes to this research field by
comparing the different algorithms presently deployed and assessing their
advantages and shortcomings compared to each other. To this aim, three
different thermal-hydraulics problems are considered: two benchmark 'flow over
cylinder' test cases at diverse Reynolds numbers, whose datasets are,
respectively, obtained with the FEniCS finite element solver and retrieved from
the CFDbench dataset, and the DYNASTY experimental facility operating at
Politecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by
internally heated fluids for Generation IV nuclear applications, whose dataset
was generated using the RELAP5 nodal solver.

## GPU-centric Communication Schemes for HPC and ML Applications

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24230v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Compute nodes on modern heterogeneous supercomputing systems comprise CPUs,
GPUs, and high-speed network interconnects (NICs). Parallelization is
identified as a technique for effectively utilizing these systems to execute
scalable simulation and deep learning workloads. The resulting inter-process
communication from the distributed execution of these parallel workloads is one
of the key factors contributing to its performance bottleneck. Most programming
models and runtime systems enabling the communication requirements on these
systems support GPU-aware communication schemes that move the GPU-attached
communication buffers in the application directly from the GPU to the NIC
without staging through the host memory. A CPU thread is required to
orchestrate the communication operations even with support for such
GPU-awareness. This survey discusses various available GPU-centric
communication schemes that move the control path of the communication
operations from the CPU to the GPU. This work presents the need for the new
communication schemes, various GPU and NIC capabilities required to implement
the schemes, and the potential use-cases addressed. Based on these discussions,
challenges involved in supporting the exhibited GPU-centric communication
schemes are discussed.

## Learning Velocity and Acceleration: Self-Supervised Motion Consistency for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction

**Authors:** Yizhou Huang, Yihua Cheng, Kezhi Wang
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24272v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Understanding human motion is crucial for accurate pedestrian trajectory
prediction. Conventional methods typically rely on supervised learning, where
ground-truth labels are directly optimized against predicted trajectories. This
amplifies the limitations caused by long-tailed data distributions, making it
difficult for the model to capture abnormal behaviors. In this work, we propose
a self-supervised pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that explicitly
models position, velocity, and acceleration. We leverage velocity and
acceleration information to enhance position prediction through feature
injection and a self-supervised motion consistency mechanism. Our model
hierarchically injects velocity features into the position stream. Acceleration
features are injected into the velocity stream. This enables the model to
predict position, velocity, and acceleration jointly. From the predicted
position, we compute corresponding pseudo velocity and acceleration, allowing
the model to learn from data-generated pseudo labels and thus achieve
self-supervised learning. We further design a motion consistency evaluation
strategy grounded in physical principles; it selects the most reasonable
predicted motion trend by comparing it with historical dynamics and uses this
trend to guide and constrain trajectory generation. We conduct experiments on
the ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24290v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We introduce Open-Reasoner-Zero, the first open source implementation of
large-scale reasoning-oriented RL training focusing on scalability, simplicity
and accessibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
minimalist approach, vanilla PPO with GAE ($\lambda=1$, $\gamma=1$) and
straightforward rule-based rewards, without any KL regularization, is
sufficient to scale up both response length and benchmark performance, similar
to the phenomenon observed in DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Using the same base model as
DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B, our implementation achieves superior performance on
AIME2024, MATH500, and the GPQA Diamond benchmark while demonstrating
remarkable efficiency -- requiring only a tenth of the training steps, compared
to DeepSeek-R1-Zero pipeline. In the spirit of open source, we release our
source code, parameter settings, training data, and model weights across
various sizes.

## Fair Dynamic Spectrum Access via Fully Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Yubo Zhang, Pedro Botelho, Trevor Gordon, Gil Zussman, Igor Kadota
**Categories:** cs.NI, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24296v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We consider a decentralized wireless network with several source-destination
pairs sharing a limited number of orthogonal frequency bands. Sources learn to
adapt their transmissions (specifically, their band selection strategy) over
time, in a decentralized manner, without sharing information with each other.
Sources can only observe the outcome of their own transmissions (i.e., success
or collision), having no prior knowledge of the network size or of the
transmission strategy of other sources. The goal of each source is to maximize
their own throughput while striving for network-wide fairness. We propose a
novel fully decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based solution that
achieves fairness without coordination. The proposed Fair Share RL (FSRL)
solution combines: (i) state augmentation with a semi-adaptive time reference;
(ii) an architecture that leverages risk control and time difference
likelihood; and (iii) a fairness-driven reward structure. We evaluate FSRL in
more than 50 network settings with different number of agents, different
amounts of available spectrum, in the presence of jammers, and in an ad-hoc
setting. Simulation results suggest that, when we compare FSRL with a common
baseline RL algorithm from the literature, FSRL can be up to 89.0% fairer (as
measured by Jain's fairness index) in stringent settings with several sources
and a single frequency band, and 48.1% fairer on average.

## Solving the Best Subset Selection Problem via Suboptimal Algorithms

**Authors:** Vikram Singh, Min Sun
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, 90C59, 65K05
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24300v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Best subset selection in linear regression is well known to be nonconvex and
computationally challenging to solve, as the number of possible subsets grows
rapidly with increasing dimensionality of the problem. As a result, finding the
global optimal solution via an exact optimization method for a problem with
dimensions of 1000s may take an impractical amount of CPU time. This suggests
the importance of finding suboptimal procedures that can provide good
approximate solutions using much less computational effort than exact methods.
In this work, we introduce a new procedure and compare it with other popular
suboptimal algorithms to solve the best subset selection problem. Extensive
computational experiments using synthetic and real data have been performed.
The results provide insights into the performance of these methods in different
data settings. The new procedure is observed to be a competitive suboptimal
algorithm for solving the best subset selection problem for high-dimensional
data.

## NoProp: Training Neural Networks without Back-propagation or Forward-propagation

**Authors:** Qinyu Li, Yee Whye Teh, Razvan Pascanu
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24322v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The canonical deep learning approach for learning requires computing a
gradient term at each layer by back-propagating the error signal from the
output towards each learnable parameter. Given the stacked structure of neural
networks, where each layer builds on the representation of the layer below,
this approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features
live on the top layers of the model, while features on lower layers are
expected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning
method named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards
propagation. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from diffusion and flow matching
methods, where each layer independently learns to denoise a noisy target. We
believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family of
gradient-free learning methods, that does not learn hierarchical
representations -- at least not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the
representation at each layer beforehand to a noised version of the target,
learning a local denoising process that can then be exploited at inference. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100
image classification benchmarks. Our results show that NoProp is a viable
learning algorithm which achieves superior accuracy, is easier to use and
computationally more efficient compared to other existing back-propagation-free
methods. By departing from the traditional gradient based learning paradigm,
NoProp alters how credit assignment is done within the network, enabling more
efficient distributed learning as well as potentially impacting other
characteristics of the learning process.

## Self-Supervised Pretraining for Aerial Road Extraction

**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24326v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Deep neural networks for aerial image segmentation require large amounts of
labeled data, but high-quality aerial datasets with precise annotations are
scarce and costly to produce. To address this limitation, we propose a
self-supervised pretraining method that improves segmentation performance while
reducing reliance on labeled data. Our approach uses inpainting-based
pretraining, where the model learns to reconstruct missing regions in aerial
images, capturing their inherent structure before being fine-tuned for road
extraction. This method improves generalization, enhances robustness to domain
shifts, and is invariant to model architecture and dataset choice. Experiments
show that our pretraining significantly boosts segmentation accuracy,
especially in low-data regimes, making it a scalable solution for aerial image
analysis.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07119v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range
of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based
phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual
particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display
interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a
reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in
the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents
results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work,
we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes
at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We
then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with
macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge
the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions
for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an
archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges
across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion
systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes
a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions
with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open
settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon
which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across
scales.

**Abstract:**
We consider the Wigner matrix $W_{n}$ of dimension $n \times n$ as $n \to
\infty$. The objective of this paper is two folds: first we construct an
operator $\mathcal{W}$ on a suitable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and then
define a suitable notion of convergence such that the matrices $W_{n}$ converge
in that notion of convergence to $\mathcal{W}$. We further investigate some
properties of $\mathcal{W}$ and $\mathcal{H}$. We show that $\mathcal{H}$ is a
nontrivial extension of $L^{2}[0,1]$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure and
the spectral measure of $\mathcal{W}$ at any function $f \in L^{2}[0,1]$ is
almost surely the semicircular law.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08758v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a quantum-mechanical model that bridges the realms of
cognition and quantum mechanics, offering a novel perspective on
decision-making under risk and perceptual reversals. By integrating quantum
theories addressing decision-theoretic anomalies with examples from immersive
video games like "Deal or No Deal", we seek to elucidate complex human
cognitive behaviours. Study 1 showcases the proposed quantum model's
superiority over traditional decision-making approaches using the "Deal or No
Deal" video game experiment. In Study 2, we apply our model to bistable
perceptions, taking the Necker cube from the Necker game as a primary example.
While previous works have hinted at connections between quantum mechanics and
cognition, Study 3 provides a more tangible link, likening the physics that
underpins quantum tunnelling to an eye blink's role in perceptual reversals.
Conclusively, our model displays a promising ability to interpret diverse
optical illusions and psychological phenomena, marking a significant stride in
understanding human decision making.

## Thermodynamic and energetic constraints on transition probabilities of small-scale quantum systems

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00981v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We study the transition probabilities of a two-point measurement on a quantum
system, initially prepared in a thermal state. We find two independent
constraints on the difference between transition probabilities when the system
is prepared at different temperatures, which both turn out to be particularly
restrictive when the measured quantum system is small. These bounds take the
form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated
with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to increase or
to reduce the temperature of the system. The derived constraints apply to
arbitrary system Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy
spectra. We show the relevance of these constraints for the special case where
transitions are induced by energy or particle exchange in weakly coupled
bipartite systems out of equilibrium. This example is of interest for a wide
range of experimentally relevant systems, from molecular junctions to coupled
cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium
tunneling current and its noise.

## Bi-self-trapping of excitons via the long-living phonon mode and their superfluorescent markers

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16874v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
A dynamic approach based on the multiconfiguration Haqrtree method to
description of exciton self-trapping is proposed. Primarily motivated by the
phenomenon of room-temperature superfluorescence recently observed in hybrid
perovskites at high excitation concentrations we offer the two-step mechanism:
formation of two self-trapped excitons entangled via the same long-living
phonon mode, and their rearrangement into a superradiating mirror symmetric
configuration. In particular, based on the semiclassical equations of motion we
examine the criteria for the high-temperature self-trapping and bi-self
trapping of excitons. Our findings indicate that the self-trapped excitons are
described by the stable phase-locked steady-state solution of the equations of
motion, and at elevated exciton concentrations, they compete with the
bi-self-trapped excitons. The bi-self-trapped exciton in the mirror-symmetric
configuration can be described by the Dicke Hamiltonian and is responsible for
superfluorescence. The obtained theoretical spectra are in good agreement with
the experimental observation.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted
segment of a larger quantum many-body state, while generating entanglement for
its remaining constituents. We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced
phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states.
In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to
symmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we
investigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the
decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the
toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected
topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the
boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The
corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the
2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at
$\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher
network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of
self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or
(non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from
this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel
type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising
model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach
combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we
chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and
entanglement entropy measures. Our results point to a way towards a general
understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of
symmetry and topology.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18006v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The development of quantum image representation and quantum measurement
techniques has made quantum image processing research a hot topic. In this
paper, a novel Adaptive Quantum Scaling Model (AQSM) is first proposed for
scrambling watermark images. Then, on the basis of the proposed AQSM, a novel
quantum watermarking scheme is presented. Unlike existing quantum watermarking
schemes with fixed embedding scales, the proposed method can flexibly embed
watermarks of different sizes. In order to improve the robustness of the
watermarking algorithm, a novel Histogram Distribution-based Watermarking
Mechanism (HDWM) is proposed, which utilizes the histogram distribution
property of the watermark image to determine the embedding strategy. In order
to improve the accuracy of extracted watermark information, a quantum refining
method is suggested, which can realize a certain error correction. The required
key quantum circuits are designed. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of
the proposed quantum watermarking method are evaluated by simulation
experiments on three image size scales. The results demonstrate the
invisibility and good robustness of the watermarking algorithm.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13706v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum
impurities in a macroscopically large bath. The algorithm is few-body
revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made
inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation.
Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their
associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values,
leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of
the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up
to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum
relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement
structures in the Kondo screening cloud.

**Abstract:**
The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand
for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study
presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically
extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The
classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst
incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability,
achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies
key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the
evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the
QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand
for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing
industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by
large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and
workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational
programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships
to bridge the QT workforce gap.

## Double commutator method for a two band Bose-Einstein condensate: superfluid density of a flat band superfluid

**Authors:** Yi-Cai Zhang
**Categories:** cond-mat.quant-gas, cond-mat.supr-con, quant-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23656v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band
bosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid
and normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can
be easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have
determined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal
density by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the
velocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we
investigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and
excitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities
explicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly
proportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the
compressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid
density depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of
U(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we
have observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly
proportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum
metric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the
excitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid
density of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction
parameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid
densities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation
theory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior
of a flat band BEC.

## Measurement-induced phase transitions for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential

**Authors:** Toranosuke Matsubara, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga
**Categories:** cond-mat.quant-gas, cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23807v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a
quasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model with hopping
rate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory
method, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy
and demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a
critical potential strength $V_c/J \sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the
measurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law
phase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V< V_c$, while any
finite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V>V_c$. This result is
distinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law
and area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the
phase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it
shows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in
the area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing
quasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation
number with an off-resonant probe light.

## Creation of a black hole bomb instability in an electromagnetic system

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24034v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The amplification and generation of electromagnetic radiation by a rotating
metallic or lossy cylinder, first theorized by Zeldovich in the 1970s, is
tightly connected to the concepts of quantum friction, energy extraction from
rotating black holes and runaway mechanisms such as black hole bombs. Despite
recent advances including acoustic analogues of the Zeldovich effect and the
observation of a negative resistance in a low-frequency electromagnetic model,
actual positive signal amplitude gain, the spontaneous generation of
electromagnetic waves and runaway amplifi- cation effects have never been
experimentally verified. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that a
mechanically rotating metallic cylinder not only definitively acts as an
amplifier of a rotating elec- tromagnetic field mode but also, when paired with
a low-loss resonator, becomes unstable and acts as a generator, seeded only by
noise. The system exhibits an exponential runaway amplification of
spontaneously generated electromagnetic modes thus demonstrating the
electromagnetic analogue of Press and Teukolskys black hole bomb. The
exponential amplification from noise supports theoretical investigations into
black hole instabilities and is promising for the development of future
experiments to observe quantum friction in the form of the Zeldovich effect
seeded by the quantum vacuum.

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24042v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables
monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by
improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between
emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness,
bonding strength, and scalability. In this study, we investigate strain effects
in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near
the diamond-SiO2/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch
between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are
characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically
detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL
mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding
irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain
component increase of ~0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of ~0.71 MHz
between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast
and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible
deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and
PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding
quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing
scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.

## Jordanian deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2 $-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain

**Authors:** Riccardo Borsato, Miguel García Fernández

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24223v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the
non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the
deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the
$\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of
$\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The
deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable,
the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits
a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian
coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit
examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe
ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the
deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an
undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived
from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant
$XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24353v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in
any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th R\'enyi entropy
$S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm
Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n
\rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is
spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated
in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this
result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular
Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea
to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss
the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability
of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an
analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.

## The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24380v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the
extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental
phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The
quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are
less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have
been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a
unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the
realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility
edges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct
phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we
show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry
preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a
criteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with
mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical
states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized
incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a
novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless
systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact
solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we
identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system
hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single
model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization.
Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using
quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.

## How interacting Bose gases scatter light

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24386v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The innate tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury
Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a primary manifestation
of quantum statistics. This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental
processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into
already occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of
light scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\rm
f}$, where $N_{\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state.
Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a
quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak
interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have
a dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local)
beyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can
completely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive
ones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly
tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of
magnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics. Its extreme
sensitivity to dynamical beyond-mean-field effects makes off-resonant light
scattering a simple and powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic
gases.

## Dynamics of Spinning Test Body in quadratic Einstein-Cartan Theory and its Free-fall Test

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24087v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We study the dynamics of the non-relativistic spinning test body (STB) in the
framework of Einstein-Cartan theory(ECT), in which the weak equivalence
principle is violated by the spin-gravitational interaction. We derive the
general equation of geodesic in terms of comoving tetrads. More concretely, we
consider the case of the quadratic form of the lagrangian, within the
environment of weak and static spherically symmetric space-time. We find that
the trajectories of STB deviate from the traditional Mathisson\textendash
Papapetrou equation, which is due to the coupling of the spin of the test
particle to the torsion field of the environment. This allows us to test the
theory with free-fall experiment in the laboratory, such as atom
interferometer. By using the previous data, we find the upper bound of the
possible torsion field on Earth is given by up to $2.0\times 10^{1}
\mathrm{~m^{-1}}$ and torsion gradient up to $3.1 \times
10^{-6}\mathrm{~m^{-2}}$. This result may enable us to provide a theoretical
foundation for future precision measurements of the existence of the fifth
force.

**Abstract:**
Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window into the universe,
enabling the study of extreme astrophysical phenomena that are otherwise
obscured in traditional electromagnetic observations. While global efforts have
predominantly focused on low- and mid-frequency GW detection, the
high-frequency regime, particularly in the kilohertz (kHz) range, remains
underexplored despite its potential to reveal critical insights into compact
binary mergers, neutron star physics, and other exotic astrophysical sources.
In this context, the Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a
pioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. Featuring a 12-meter
L-shaped resonator within a two-arm vacuum system, the BNU prototype is
designed to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges
for kHz GW detection. Beyond its primary focus on being a technology testbed
and demonstrator for kHz detection, the prototype is also being evaluated for
its own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to
explore even higher-frequency signals from e.g., primordial black holes and
geontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
BNU prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.

## A Minimal Control Family of Dynamical Systems for Universal Approximation

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12903v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The universal approximation property (UAP) holds a fundamental position in
deep learning, as it provides a theoretical foundation for the expressive power
of neural networks. It is widely recognized that a composition of linear and
nonlinear functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation
function, can approximate continuous functions on compact domains. In this
paper, we extend this efficacy to a scenario containing dynamical systems with
controls. We prove that the control family $\mathcal{F}_1$ containing all
affine maps and the nonlinear ReLU map is sufficient for generating flow maps
that can approximate orientation-preserving (OP) diffeomorphisms on any compact
domain. Since $\mathcal{F}_1$ contains only one nonlinear function and the UAP
does not hold if we remove the nonlinear function, we call $\mathcal{F}_1$ a
minimal control family for the UAP. On this basis, several mild sufficient
conditions, such as affine invariance, are established for the control family
and discussed. Our results reveal an underlying connection between the
approximation power of neural networks and control systems and could provide
theoretical guidance for examining the approximation power of flow-based
models.

eliminates irrelevant collision avoidance constraints, enhancing computational
efficiency. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated traffic intersection

## Cascade Reward Sampling for Efficient Decoding-Time Alignment

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16306v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is essential for
their applications. Recently, decoding-time alignment has emerged as an
effective plug-and-play technique that avoids fine-tuning model parameters.
This approach retains the general utility of pretrained LLMs but often suffers
from significant inefficiencies during decoding, primarily due to wasted token
generation and excessive reward evaluations. To address these challenges, we
introduce Cascade Reward Sampling (CARDS) to resolve both efficiency
bottlenecks in decoding-time alignment. Specifically, we develop a
segment-level rejection sampling algorithm that minimizes redundant
computations of both LLMs and reward models (RMs). Central to CARDS is an
uncertainty-based segmentation mechanism, which ensures the accuracy of RMs
evaluations on incomplete segments. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis
of reward scores on segments to elucidate the improved alignment performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that CARDS significantly improves decoding
efficiency, alignment quality, and general utility compared to existing
decoding-time alignment methods, achieving approximately a 70% reduction in
decoding time and over 90% win-ties in utility and safety benchmarks.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to
produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become
a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the
evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer
from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current
evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for
practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a
large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal
comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE
comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories,
12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics,
literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs,
offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate
diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation
metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and
systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark
and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs.
Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show
significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We
believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved
LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in
https://mmie-bench.github.io/.

## Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections

**Authors:** Di Chen, Ruiguo Zhong, Kehua Chen, Zhiwei Shang, Meixin Zhu, Edward Chung

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00162v2
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections
presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in
dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an
increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges
by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and
efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn,
and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety
and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such
environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that
integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a
diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser).
The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing
the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert
demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints
significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory
execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the
proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of
surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the
conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity
evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its
robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes,
uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a
wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Comprehensive performance
evaluations demonstrate that DSC-Diffuser generates realistic, stable, and
generalizable policies, providing flexibility and reliable safety assurance in
complex multi-task driving scenarios.

computationally tractable methodology that is compatible with any system and
parametric family of models. Our approach only requires input-output data from
the system and first-order information from the model with respect to the
parameters. Our algorithm consists of two modules. First, we formulate the
problem of system identification from a Bayesian perspective and use a linear
Gaussian model approximation to iteratively optimize the model's parameters. In
each iteration, we propose to use the input-output data to tune the covariance
of the linear Gaussian model. This statistically calibrates the approach.
Secondly, we define a Gaussian-based uncertainty measure for the model
parameters, which we can then minimize with respect to the next selected input.
We test our method with linear and nonlinear dynamics.

## THEMIS: Towards Practical Intellectual Property Protection for Post-Deployment On-Device Deep Learning Models

**Authors:** Yujin Huang, Zhi Zhang, Qingchuan Zhao, Xingliang Yuan, Chunyang Chen
**Categories:** cs.CR, cs.LG, cs.SE

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23748v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
On-device deep learning (DL) has rapidly gained adoption in mobile apps,
offering the benefits of offline model inference and user privacy preservation
over cloud-based approaches. However, it inevitably stores models on user
devices, introducing new vulnerabilities, particularly model-stealing attacks
and intellectual property infringement. While system-level protections like
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide a robust solution, practical
challenges remain in achieving scalable on-device DL model protection,
including complexities in supporting third-party models and limited adoption in
current mobile solutions. Advancements in TEE-enabled hardware, such as
NVIDIA's GPU-based TEEs, may address these obstacles in the future. Currently,
watermarking serves as a common defense against model theft but also faces
challenges here as many mobile app developers lack corresponding machine
learning expertise and the inherent read-only and inference-only nature of
on-device DL models prevents third parties like app stores from implementing
existing watermarking techniques in post-deployment models.
  To protect the intellectual property of on-device DL models, in this paper,
we propose THEMIS, an automatic tool that lifts the read-only restriction of
on-device DL models by reconstructing their writable counterparts and leverages
the untrainable nature of on-device DL models to solve watermark parameters and
protect the model owner's intellectual property. Extensive experimental results
across various datasets and model structures show the superiority of THEMIS in
terms of different metrics. Further, an empirical investigation of 403
real-world DL mobile apps from Google Play is performed with a success rate of
81.14%, showing the practicality of THEMIS.

## Free Parametrization of L2-bounded State Space Models

**Authors:** Leonardo Massai, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate
**Categories:** eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.SY
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23818v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Structured state-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a powerful architecture
in machine learning and control, featuring stacked layers where each consists
of a linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete-time system followed by a
nonlinearity. While SSMs offer computational efficiency and excel in
long-sequence predictions, their widespread adoption in applications like
system identification and optimal control is hindered by the challenge of
ensuring their stability and robustness properties. We introduce L2RU, a novel
parametrization of SSMs that guarantees input-output stability and robustness
by enforcing a prescribed L-bound for all parameter values. This design
eliminates the need for complex constraints, allowing unconstrained
optimization over L2RUs by using standard methods such as gradient descent.
Leveraging tools from system theory and convex optimization, we derive a
non-conservative parametrization of square discrete-time LTI systems with a
specified L2-bound, forming the foundation of the L2RU architecture.
Additionally, we enhance its performance with a bespoke initialization strategy
optimized for long input sequences. Through a system identification task, we
validate L2RU's superior performance, showcasing its potential in learning and
control applications.

## ZeroMimic: Distilling Robotic Manipulation Skills from Web Videos

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23877v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Many recent advances in robotic manipulation have come through imitation
learning, yet these rely largely on mimicking a particularly hard-to-acquire
form of demonstrations: those collected on the same robot in the same room with
the same objects as the trained policy must handle at test time. In contrast,
large pre-recorded human video datasets demonstrating manipulation skills
in-the-wild already exist, which contain valuable information for robots. Is it
possible to distill a repository of useful robotic skill policies out of such
data without any additional requirements on robot-specific demonstrations or
exploration? We present the first such system ZeroMimic, that generates
immediately deployable image goal-conditioned skill policies for several common
categories of manipulation tasks (opening, closing, pouring, pick&place,
cutting, and stirring) each capable of acting upon diverse objects and across
diverse unseen task setups. ZeroMimic is carefully designed to exploit recent
advances in semantic and geometric visual understanding of human videos,
together with modern grasp affordance detectors and imitation policy classes.
After training ZeroMimic on the popular EpicKitchens dataset of ego-centric
human videos, we evaluate its out-of-the-box performance in varied real-world
and simulated kitchen settings with two different robot embodiments,
demonstrating its impressive abilities to handle these varied tasks. To enable
plug-and-play reuse of ZeroMimic policies on other task setups and robots, we
release software and policy checkpoints of our skill policies.

## AutoML Algorithms for Online Generalized Additive Model Selection: Application to Electricity Demand Forecasting

**Authors:** Keshav Das, Julie Keisler, Margaux Brégère, Amaury Durand
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.AP
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24019v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Electricity demand forecasting is key to ensuring that supply meets demand
lest the grid would blackout. Reliable short-term forecasts may be obtained by
combining a Generalized Additive Models (GAM) with a State-Space model (Obst et
al., 2021), leading to an adaptive (or online) model. A GAM is an
over-parameterized linear model defined by a formula and a state-space model
involves hyperparameters. Both the formula and adaptation parameters have to be
fixed before model training and have a huge impact on the model's predictive
performance. We propose optimizing them using the DRAGON package of Keisler
(2025), originally designed for neural architecture search. This work
generalizes it for automated online generalized additive model selection by
defining an efficient modeling of the search space (namely, the space of the
GAM formulae and adaptation parameters). Its application to short-term French
electricity demand forecasting demonstrates the relevance of the approach

## New universal operator approximation theorem for encoder-decoder architectures (Preprint)

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24092v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Motivated by the rapidly growing field of mathematics for operator
approximation with neural networks, we present a novel universal operator
approximation theorem for a broad class of encoder-decoder architectures. In
this study, we focus on approximating continuous operators in
$\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})$, where $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$
are infinite-dimensional normed or metric spaces, and we consider uniform
convergence on compact subsets of $\mathcal{X}$. Unlike standard results in the
operator learning literature, we investigate the case where the approximating
operator sequence can be chosen independently of the compact sets. Taking a
topological perspective, we analyze different types of operator approximation
and show that compact-set-independent approximation is a strictly stronger
property in most relevant operator learning frameworks. To establish our
results, we introduce a new approximation property tailored to encoder-decoder
architectures, which enables us to prove a universal operator approximation
theorem ensuring uniform convergence on every compact subset. This result
unifies and extends existing universal operator approximation theorems for
various encoder-decoder architectures, including classical DeepONets,
BasisONets, special cases of MIONets, architectures based on frames and other
related approaches.

## Enhancing Image Resolution of Solar Magnetograms: A Latent Diffusion Model Approach

**Authors:** Francesco Pio Ramunno, Paolo Massa, Vitaliy Kinakh, Brandon Panos, André Csillaghy, Slava Voloshynovskiy
**Categories:** astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24271v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
The spatial properties of the solar magnetic field are crucial to decoding
the physical processes in the solar interior and their interplanetary effects.
However, observations from older instruments, such as the Michelson Doppler
Imager (MDI), have limited spatial or temporal resolution, which hinders the
ability to study small-scale solar features in detail. Super resolving these
older datasets is essential for uniform analysis across different solar cycles,
enabling better characterization of solar flares, active regions, and magnetic
network dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion model approach
for Super-Resolution and we apply it to MDI magnetograms to match the
higher-resolution capabilities of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI).
By training a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with residuals on downscaled HMI
data and fine-tuning it with paired MDI/HMI data, we can enhance the resolution
of MDI observations from 2"/pixel to 0.5"/pixel. We evaluate the quality of the
reconstructed images by means of classical metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, FID and
LPIPS) and we check if physical properties, such as the unsigned magnetic flux
or the size of an active region, are preserved. We compare our model with
different variations of LDM and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models
(DDPMs), but also with two deterministic architectures already used in the past
for performing the Super-Resolution task. Furthermore, we show with an analysis
in the Fourier domain that the LDM with residuals can resolve features smaller
than 2", and due to the probabilistic nature of the LDM, we can asses their
reliability, in contrast with the deterministic models. Future studies aim to
super-resolve the temporal scale of the solar MDI instrument so that we can
also have a better overview of the dynamics of the old events.

## Policy Gradient for LQR with Domain Randomization

**Authors:** Tesshu Fujinami, Bruce D. Lee, Nikolai Matni, George J. Pappas
**Categories:** eess.SY, cs.LG, cs.SY
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24371v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Domain randomization (DR) enables sim-to-real transfer by training
controllers on a distribution of simulated environments, with the goal of
achieving robust performance in the real world. Although DR is widely used in
practice and is often solved using simple policy gradient (PG) methods,
understanding of its theoretical guarantees remains limited. Toward addressing
this gap, we provide the first convergence analysis of PG methods for
domain-randomized linear quadratic regulation (LQR). We show that PG converges
globally to the minimizer of a finite-sample approximation of the DR objective
under suitable bounds on the heterogeneity of the sampled systems. We also
quantify the sample-complexity associated with achieving a small performance
gap between the sample-average and population-level objectives. Additionally,
we propose and analyze a discount-factor annealing algorithm that obviates the
need for an initial jointly stabilizing controller, which may be challenging to
find. Empirical results support our theoretical findings and highlight
promising directions for future work, including risk-sensitive DR formulations
and stochastic PG algorithms.

## Mitigating Covariate Shift in Imitation Learning for Autonomous Vehicles Using Latent Space Generative World Models

**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16663v3
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the
covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural
network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and
actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy
effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of
training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover
from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that
at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution.
Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that
employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present
qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements
upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as
well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's
DRIVE Sim.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the
interest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers
have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos,
which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user
behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence
Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method
perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video)
dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video
propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on
short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926
samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the
propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or
provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment
content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a
novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured
data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation
graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of
short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both
classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the
superiority of our method for SPIR.

## Feature learning from non-Gaussian inputs: the case of Independent Component Analysis in high dimensions

**Authors:** Fabiola Ricci, Lorenzo Bardone, Sebastian Goldt
**Categories:** stat.ML, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.LG, math.PR
**Source:** arxiv
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23896v1
**Published/Updated:** 2025-03-31

**Abstract:**
Deep neural networks learn structured features from complex, non-Gaussian
inputs, but the mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood. Our
work is motivated by the observation that the first-layer filters learnt by
deep convolutional neural networks from natural images resemble those learnt by
independent component analysis (ICA), a simple unsupervised method that seeks
the most non-Gaussian projections of its inputs. This similarity suggests that
ICA provides a simple, yet principled model for studying feature learning.
Here, we leverage this connection to investigate the interplay between data
structure and optimisation in feature learning for the most popular ICA
algorithm, FastICA, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is used to
train deep networks. We rigorously establish that FastICA requires at least
$n\gtrsim d^4$ samples to recover a single non-Gaussian direction from
$d$-dimensional inputs on a simple synthetic data model. We show that vanilla
online SGD outperforms FastICA, and prove that the optimal sample complexity $n
\gtrsim d^2$ can be reached by smoothing the loss, albeit in a data-dependent
way. We finally demonstrate the existence of a search phase for FastICA on
ImageNet, and discuss how the strong non-Gaussianity of said images compensates
for the poor sample complexity of FastICA.

5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated
with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal
behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape
recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly
improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent.
The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities

allow reinforcement learning agents to display behaviour consistent with
reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed
on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a
5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated
with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal
behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape
recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly
improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent.
The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities
of combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.

**Abstract:**
Many diverse bacteria can enter non- or slow-growing states where they are transiently tolerant to antibiotics. Despite its medical importance, the genetic mechanisms underlying this 'persistence' remain largely unknown, especially for spontaneous (type II) persistence that arise during exponential growth in rich medium. To address this challenge, here we combine genomic, transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis to identify the persistence mechanisms. We first analyzed the genome of the high-persistence mutant Escherichia coli DS1 (hipQ) to identify candidate genes for the high persistence phenotype. We then compared the gene expression profile of spontaneous persisters to normally growing cells with RNAseq and find that the activation of stress response mechanisms is likely not very important in the entrance into hipQ-driven spontaneous persistence. Transcriptomic results also suggest that modifications in the cell membrane play an important role, as further corroborated by lipidomic profiles showing a higher level of unsaturated fatty acids in spontaneous persisters compared to induced persisters or normally growing cells. Taken together, our results indicate that changing membrane composition is a key process in persistence, and further our understanding of spontaneous persister cells from the DS1 (hipQ) context.

**Abstract:**
Cooperation is essential for success in society. Research consistently showed that adolescents are less cooperative than adults, which is often attributed to underdeveloped mentalizing that limits their expectations of others. However, the internal computations underlying this reduced cooperation remain largely unexplored. This study compared cooperation between adolescents and adults using a repeated Prisoners Dilemma Game. Adolescents cooperated less than adults, particularly after their partners cooperation. Computational modeling revealed that adults increased their intrinsic reward for reciprocating when their partner continued cooperating, a pattern absent in adolescents. Both computational modeling and self-reported ratings showed that adolescents did not differ from adults in building expectations of their partners cooperation. Therefore, the reduced cooperation appears driven by a lower intrinsic reward for reciprocity, reflecting a stronger motive to prioritize self-interest, rather than a deficiency in mentalizing or social learning. These findings provide insights into the developmental trajectory of cooperation from adolescence to adulthood.

## Ancient Trans-Species Polymorphism at the Major Histocompatibility Complex in Primates

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
Classical genes within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are responsible for peptide presentation to T cells, thus playing a central role in immune defense against pathogens. These genes are subject to strong selective pressures including both balancing and directional selection, resulting in exceptional genetic diversity--thousands of alleles per gene in humans. Moreover, some allelic lineages appear to be shared between primate species, a phenomenon known as trans-species polymorphism (TSP) or incomplete lineage sorting, which is rare in the genome overall. However, despite the clinical and evolutionary importance of MHC diversity, we currently lack a full picture of primate MHC evolution. In particular, we do not know to what extent genes and allelic lineages are retained across speciation events. To start addressing this gap, we explore variation across genes and species in our companion paper (Fortier and Pritchard, 2025) and here we explore variation within individual genes. We used Bayesian phylogenetic methods to determine the extent of TSP at 17 MHC genes, including classical and non-classical Class I and Class II genes. We find strong support for ancient TSP in 7 of 10 classical genes, including--remarkably--between humans and old-world monkeys in MHC-DQB1. In addition to the long-term persistence of ancient lineages, we additionally observe rapid evolution at nucleotides encoding the proteins' peptide-binding domains. The most rapidly-evolving amino acid positions are extremely enriched for autoimmune and infectious disease associations. Together, these results suggest complex selective forces--arising from differential peptide binding--that drive short-term allelic turnover within lineages while also maintaining deeply divergent lineages for at least 31 million years in some cases.

**Abstract:**
Sensorimotor computations for learning and behavior rely on precise patterns of synaptic connectivity. Yet, we typically lack the synaptic wiring diagrams for long-range connections between sensory and motor circuits in the brain. Here we provide the synaptic wiring diagram for sensorimotor circuits involved in learning and production of male zebra finch song, a natural and ethologically relevant behavior. We examined the functional synaptic connectivity from the 4 main sensory afferent pathways onto the 3 known classes of projection neurons of the song premotor cortical region HVC. Recordings from hundreds of identified projection neurons reveal rules for monosynaptic connectivity and the existence of polysynaptic ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in HVC. Circuit tracing further identifies novel connections between HVCs presynaptic partners. Our results indicate a modular organization of ensemble-like networks for integrating long-range input with local circuits, providing important context for information flow and computations for learned vocal behavior.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-04

**Abstract:**
The immediate social context critically modulates drug consumption. The presence of an unfamiliar conspecific, naive to the drug, at the time of consumption reduces cocaine self-administration in male rats during short-access sessions, as well as drug intake in human cocaine users. The subthalamic nucleus (STN), a brain structure involved in cocaine addiction and limbic processes, has been proposed to mediate such social influence on this limited level of drug intake. Whether this influence extends to escalated drug consumption remains an open question. In this study, we compared the effect of the presence of an unfamiliar peer, naive to cocaine, on cocaine self-administration in rats having been exposed to either short (2h) or long-access sessions (6h). We showed that the presence of the peer drastically reduced both limited and escalated cocaine intake in males, while it had no effect on females during short-access sessions. Assessing the effect of STN photo-inhibition or high frequency (HF) stimulation in male rats, we demonstrated that it had no effect in the absence of the conspecific in short-access sessions, STN photo-manipulation suppressed the influence of the peer presence. Moreover, STN photo-inhibition and HF stimulation decreased drug consumption in long-access sessions, but no additive effect was observed when associated with the peer presence, confirming an overriding effect of STN manipulation. Taken together, these results highlight the potential influence of socially oriented manipulations on cocaine intake and further position the STN as a critical mediator of the effect of social presence on addictive-like behaviors.

**Abstract:**
Building on the known scaling law that a single timescale, a cellular unit of time, governs stochastic growth and division of individual bacterial cells under constant growth conditions, here we propose that a dynamic rescaling of the cellular unit of time serves to capture the dominant effect of changing conditions on the cell age distribution. This temporal scaling ansatz provides a natural representation for these time-dependent dynamics in whose terms the cell age distribution evolves under time-invariant rules! Finally, we discuss relevance of these results to recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells growing and dividing in dynamic environments.

**Abstract:**
The genome, which serves as the inherent language directing the blueprint of life, offers significant analysis prospects by combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Integrating biological sequences with other digital healthcare information has potential to transform data-driven diagnostics. Large language models (LLMs) can be harnessed to decode the genomic language. This endeavor encounters three critical challenges: First, long biomolecular sequences require segmentation into smaller subunits, which is non-trivial since many biological "words" remain unknown. Second, the analysis of extended DNA sequences using LLMs demands a compute-intensive infrastructure. Third, ensuring reproducibility and reusability of modeling workflows remains an unresolved issue. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an empirical DNA tokenisation approach and a versatile, semantic-aware, genome language model genomicBERT. The model is species-agnostic and operates seamlessly at the DNA or RNA levels. By introducing a reduced and specialized DNA vocabulary, our approach minimizes computational overhead and optimizes performance. Our benchmarking demonstrates that the genomicBERT matches or surpasses the performance of contemporary tools on the same datasets under different experimental conditions. To encourage collaboration and ease of access, we introduce genomicBERT as an integral component of the openly accessible conda package, genomeNLP. Validated across diverse case studies, genomicBERT lowers the barriers to decoding genomic language, relying solely on sequence data to extract meaningful insights.

## Enhanced 5mC-Methylation-Site Recognition in DNA Sequences using Token Classification and a Domain-specific Loss Function

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-04

**Abstract:**
DNA 5-methylcytosine modification has been widely studied in mammals and plays an important role in epigenetics. Several computational methods exist that attempt to determine the methylation state of a DNA sequence centered at a possible methylation site. Here, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework, MR-DNA, that predicts the methylation state of a single nucleotide located in a gene promoter region. The idea is to adapt the named-entity recognition approach to methylation-site prediction and to incorporate biological rules during model construction. MR-DNA has a stacked model architecture consisting of a pre-trained MuLan-Methyl-DistilBERT language model and a conditional random field algorithm, trained with a self-defined methyl loss function. The resulting fine-tuned model achieves an accuracy of 97.9% on an independent test dataset of samples. An advantage of this formulation of the methylation-site identification task is that it predicts on every nucleotide of a sequence of a given length, unlike previous methods that the predict methylation state of DNA sequences of a short fixed length. For training and testing purposes, we provide a database of DNA sequences containing verified 5mC-methylation sites, calculated from data for eight human cell lines downloaded from the ENCODE database.

**Abstract:**
Objective To integrate macro-transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing to analyze the differential gene expression between primary and brain metastatic breast cancer cells, as well as between active and dormant cancer cells within brain metastases, exploring their adaptation and remodeling abilities at different stages of brain metastasis. Methods Four public datasets were used: three mRNA microarray datasets from breast cancer and brain metastasis tissues, and one single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from active and dormant brain metastatic cells. Gene differential expression, pathway enrichment, and cell clustering analyses were performed to compare primary and metastatic breast cancer cells, as well as active and dormant cells in brain metastases, focusing on gene expression, metabolic pathways, and functional pathways. Results Metastatic breast cancer cells showed weakened pathways related to the extracellular matrix and protein digestion. Active cells exhibited enhanced cell cycle regulation, tumor proliferation, and hypoxia resistance pathways compared to dormant cells. Clustering analysis revealed that cluster 6, unique to dormant cells, had enhanced functions in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen formation, tumor inflammation siganure (TIS), and IL-10 signaling. Cluster 3 and 4 in active cells had enhanced DNA replication and tumor proliferation pathways, respectively. Conclusion This study highlights the role of cancer cell characteristics and heterogeneity in the invasiveness of brain metastasis. Understanding these mechanisms can guide the development of more effective treatment strategies for breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) patients.

## Resting-state is not enough: alpha and mu rhythms change shape across development, but lack diagnostic sensitivity

**Abstract:**
In the human brain, the alpha rhythm in occipital cortex and the mu rhythm in sensorimotor cortex are among the most prominent rhythms, with both rhythms functionally implicated in gating modality-specific information. Separation of these rhythms is non-trivial due to the spatial mixing of these oscillations in sensor space. Using a computationally efficient processing pipeline requiring no manual data cleaning, we isolated alpha and/or mu rhythms from electroencephalography recordings performed on 1605 children aged 5-18. Using the extracted time series for each rhythm, we characterized the waveform shape on a cycle-by-cycle basis and examined whether and how the waveform shape differs across development. We demonstrate that alpha and mu rhythms both exhibit nonsinusoidal waveform shape that changes significantly across development, in addition to the known large changes in oscillatory frequency. This dataset also provided an opportunity to assess oscillatory measures for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found no differences in the resting-state features of these alpha-band rhythms for either ADHD or ASD in comparison to typically developing participants in this dataset. While waveform shape is ignored by traditional Fourier spectral analyses, these nonsinusoidal properties may be informative for building more constrained generative models for different types of alpha-band rhythms, yielding more specific insight into their generation.

**Abstract:**
Cortical activity results from the interplay between network-connected regions that integrate information and stimulus-driven processes originating from sensory motor networks responding to specific tasks. Separating the information due to each of these components has been challenging, and the relationship as measured by fMRI in each of these cases Rest (network) and Task (stimulus-driven) remains a significant outstanding question in the study of large-scale brain dynamics. In this study, we develop a network ordinary differential equation (ODE) model using advanced system identification tools to analyze fMRI data from both rest and task conditions. We demonstrate that task-specific ODEs are essentially a subset of rest-specific ODEs across four different tasks from the Human Connectome Project. By assuming that task activity is a relative complement of rest activity, our model significantly improves predictions of reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis, leading to a 9 % increase in explanatory power (R2) across the 14 subtasks tested. We have additionally shown that these results hold for predicting missing trials and accuracy on a per individual basis as well as classifying Tasks trajectories or resulting dynamic Task functional connectivity. Our findings establish the principle of the Active Cortex Model, which posits that the cortex is always active and that Rest State encompasses all processes, while certain subsets of processes get elevated to perform specific task computations. Thus, this study is an important milestone in the development of the fMRI equation - to causally link large-scale brain activity, brain structural connectivity, and behavioral variables within a single framework.

**Abstract:**
The ocean acts as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and resulting in substantial uptake of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. As biological processes in the oceans such as net primary production (NPP) contribute significantly to this sink, understanding how they will shift in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 is necessary to project future ocean carbon storage capacity. Macronutrient and micronutrient resource limitation within the oceans regulates NPP, and while some micronutrients such as zinc (Zn) are present at very low concentrations, their ability to limit NPP has remained unclear. Zn is a key micronutrient used by phytoplankton for a multitude of metabolic functions, yet there have been few observations of its influence on natural oceanic phytoplankton populations. In this study, we observed Zn limitation of growth in the natural phytoplankton community of Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, in addition to primary iron (Fe) limitation. Shipboard incubation experiments amended with Zn and Fe resulted in significantly higher chlorophyll a content and dissolved inorganic carbon drawdown compared to Fe addition alone. Zn and Fe stress response proteins detected in incubation and environmental biomass provided independent verification of algal co-stress for these micronutrients. We consider total biomass and low surface ocean pCO2 as potential drivers of environmental Zn stress. This study definitively establishes that Zn limitation can occur in the modern oceans, opening up new possibility space in our understanding of nutrient regulation of NPP through geologic time, and we consider the future of oceanic Zn limitation in the face of climate change.

## Evolution under vancomycin selection drives divergent collateral sensitivity patterns in Staphylococcus aureus

**Abstract:**
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is typically treated empirically with vancomycin, with therapy later tailored based on susceptibility results. However, these tests occur before vancomycin exposure and do not account for adaptation during empiric treatment that can alter S. aureus' susceptibility to first-line drugs. To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU, impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes. Our findings suggest a probabilistic approach to antimicrobial therapy, advocating for rapid genomic diagnostics alongside susceptibility testing to better anticipate and respond to evolutionary changes.

**Abstract:**
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), predominantly derived from mitochondrial respiratory complexes, have emerged as key molecules influencing cell fate decisions like maintenance and differentiation. These redox-dependent events are mainly considered to be cell intrinsic in nature, on the contrary our observations indicate involvement of these oxygen-derived entities as intercellular communicating agents. In Drosophila male germline, Germline Stem Cells (GSCs) and neighbouring Cyst Stem Cells (CySCs) maintain differential redox thresholds where CySC have higher redox-state compared to the adjacent GSCs. Disruption of the redox equilibrium between the two adjoining stem cell populations by depleting Superoxide Dismutases (SODs) especially Sod1 results in deregulated niche architecture and loss of GSCs, which was mainly attributed to loss of contact-based receptions and uncontrolled CySC proliferation due to ROS-mediated activation of self-renewing signals. Our observations hint towards the crucial role of differential redox states where CySCs containing higher ROS function not only as a source of their own maintenance cues but also serve as non-autonomous redox moderators of GSCs. Our findings underscore the complexity of niche homeostasis and predicate the importance of intercellular redox communication in understanding stem cell microenvironments.

## Causal inference for multiple risk factors and diseases from genomics data

**Abstract:**
Statistical causal learning in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) relies on the instrumental variable method of Mendelian Randomization (MR). Currently, an overwhelming number of MR studies purport to show causal relationships among a wide range of risk factors and outcomes. Here, we find that naive application of many recently proposed MR approaches results in numerous null relationships being discovered as highly significant. We show that a well-controlled error rate can be achieved through a graphical inference approach which: (i) selects a set of genetic instrumental variables (IVs) from GWAS summary static controlling for LD, linkage and pleiotropy; (ii) accommodates rare variants and binary outcomes in a principled way; (iii) distinguishes direct from indirect risk factors in very high-dimensional data; and (iv) identifies potential unobserved latent confounding. Only 20 minutes of wall-clock compute time is required for our Causal Inference GWAS (CI-GWAS) approach to jointly analyze a set of 9 common health risk factors, four common complex metabolic disease outcomes and 8.4M genetic variants recorded for 458,747 individuals in the UK Biobank. Genome-wide, we find that very few genetic variants are suitable MR IVs, with only 696 variants remaining when analyzing all traits jointly. While we replicate almost all paths previously found by CAUSE between risk factors and outcomes, we show that only few of these reflect direct adjacencies and that many cannot be distinguished from unmeasured confounding within the UK Biobank data. Our results suggest that well-curated longitudinal records and family data are likely needed to overcome the mixtures of temporal precedence and reverse-causality in biobank data. Our approach provides a first-step toward robust principled screening for potential causal links to understand the underlying nature of phenotypic correlations in biobank data.

**Abstract:**
Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have demonstrated robust induction of neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T cell activation, however CD8+ responses are variable, and the duration of immunity and protection against variants are limited. Here we repurposed our DNA origami vaccine nanotechnology, DoriVac, for targeting infectious viruses, namely SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and Ebola. The DNA origami nanoparticle, conjugated with infectious-disease-specific heptad repeat 2 (HR2) peptides, which act as highly conserved antigens, and CpG adjuvant at precise nanoscale spacing, induced neutralizing antibodies, Th1 CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in naive mice, with significant improvement over a bolus control. Pre-clinical studies using lymph-node-on-a-chip systems validated that DoriVac, when conjugated with antigenic peptides or proteins, induced promising cellular and humoral immune responses in human cells. Moreover, DoriVac bearing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein achieved immune responses comparable to current mRNA vaccine platforms while potentially reducing storage constraints. These results suggest that DoriVac holds potential as a versatile, modular vaccine platform, capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immunities, underscoring its potential utility in addressing future pandemics.

**Abstract:**
The ENCODE project has revolutionized our understanding of functional genomic elements, yet its exhaustive approach remains inaccessible to smaller communities studying non-model organisms. To address this challenge, we developed the miniENCODE framework - a resource-efficient strategy combining carefully selected experimental assays with an integrated computational platform. Using zebrafish as a model, we implemented this framework through three core assays: RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K27ac CUT\&Tag, spanning six developmental stages and 11 adult tissues. Our analysis identified 52,350 candidate enhancer-like signatures, characterized their spatiotemporal activity patterns, and experimentally validated tissue-specific enhancers. We developed the mini Omics Data Portal (miniODP) to facilitate multi-omics data re-use, integration, visualization, and analysis. Through this platform, we characterized key transcription factors and their regulatory networks in various developmental stages and adult tissues. Extending this approach to additional model organisms (cattle, lancelet, Mexican tetra, and polyp), we demonstrated its broad applicability for understanding gene regulation in diverse species. The miniENCODE framework provides a practical solution for comprehensive regulatory element characterization, enabling smaller research communities to advance genomic studies in understudied organisms without overextending their resources. This approach not only provides a valuable resource for zebrafish but also establishes a scalable model for accelerating genomic research in diverse species.

## Local Inhibitory Dynamics Underpin Temporal Integration and Functional Segregation between Barrels and Septa in the Mouse Barrel Cortex

**Abstract:**
Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker Brainstem Thalamus Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking activity upon multi-whisker stimulation, resembling the stable response pattern observed in barrels. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions.

Resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) are essential for tissue homeostasis. Their diverse functions, from monitoring interstitial fluids to clearing cellular debris, are accompanied by characteristic morphological changes that reflect their functional status. While current knowledge of macrophage behaviour comes primarily from in vitro studies, their dynamic behavior in vivo is fundamentally different, necessitating a more physiologically relevant approach to their understanding.

In this study, we employed intravital imaging to generate dynamic data from peritoneal RTMs in mice under various conditions and developed a comprehensive image processing pipeline to quantify RTM morphodynamics over time, defining human-interpretable cell size and shape features. These features allowed for the quantitative and qualitative differentiation of cell populations in various functional states, including pro- and anti-inflammatory activation and endosomal dysfunction. The study revealed that under steady-state conditions, RTMs exhibit a wide range of morphodynamical phenotypes, constituting a naive morphospace of behavioral motifs. Upon challenge, morphodynamic patterns changed uniformly at the population level but predominantly within the constraints of this naive morphospace. Notably, aged animals displayed a markedly shifted naive morphospace, indicating drastically different behavioral patterns compared to their young counterparts. The developed method also proved valuable in optimizing explanted tissue setups, bringing RTM behavior closer to the physiological native state. Our versatile approach thus provides novel insights into the dynamic behavior of bona fide macrophages in vivo, enabling the distinction between physiological and pathological cell states and the assessment of functional tissue age on a population level.

Author summaryIn this study, we combine state-of-the-art in vivo imaging with advanced computational analysis to reveal the dynamic behavior of peritoneal resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) in their natural environment. These sentinel cells, which are crucial for tissue homeostasis, constantly monitor their environment and, in the process, undergo dynamic morphological changes that have remained largely uninvestigated due to technical limitations. Using two-photon microscopy, we captured time-lapse images of RTMs in the peritoneal serosa under various experimental conditions. Our customized image processing pipeline allowed a comprehensive assessment of cell morphology and dynamics and provided unprecedented insights into the behavior of RTMs in vivo, enabling us to distinguish cell populations in different physiological and pathological states. Our work opens up new avenues for the dynamic in situ phenotyping of macrophage functionality in disease contexts without their extraction from tissues and provides a novel perspective on the behavior of RTMs in their natural microenvironment. This versatile tool promises to advance our understanding of tissue homeostasis and macrophage function in health and disease, with potential applications in both basic research and clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
Evolutionary expectations about the virulence of parasites (i.e., the parasite-induced mortality rate of the host) often focus solely on the within-host transmission stage, overlooking the time spent between hosts and variations in transmission cycles. Moreover, the parasite growth rate within the host is closely linked to virulence. We here suggest that a simplified view of transmission and parasite evolution makes predicting how virulence will evolve difficult. We illustrate our ideas with a parasite with a simple life cycle, the microsporidian Vavraia culicis, which infects the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. We selected the parasite over six host generations for early or late host transmission, corresponding to shorter or longer time within the host. Selecting for late transmission increased their exploitation of the host, resulting in higher host mortality and a shorter life cycle with rapid infective spore production, comparatively to selection for early transmission. In response, hosts infected with late-selected spores shortened their life cycle and shifted to earlier reproduction. Using different host harm metrics, we demonstrate and discuss the pros and cons of using different it as measures of virulence. These and other findings emphasize the importance of considering the entire transmission cycle in studies of parasite evolution and raise concerns about how host density and social settings might influence virulence evolution.

## Many weak and few strong links: The importance of interaction strength distributions for stabilising patterns in competition networks

**Abstract:**
Ecological networks tend to contain many weak and only few strong interactions. Furthermore, interaction strengths are often arranged or patterned in ways that enhance stability. However, little attention has been given to the relation between the "many weak and few strong links" distribution and the stabilising effect of patterning. Here, we focus on the stabilising effect of hierarchy in bryozoan competition networks, and demonstrate that it critically depends on a skewed distribution of interaction strengths. To this end, we first show that, in line with many other ecological networks, the empirically derived interaction strengths in competition networks were characterised by a high level of skewness, with many weak and few strong links. Then, we analysed the relationship between the interaction strength distributions, hierarchy and stability by comparing theoretical competition matrices with different distributions of interaction strengths. We found that the full stabilising effect of hierarchy only appeared when we used skewed interaction strengths produced by a gamma distribution, but not in matrices built with uniform or half-normal distributions. This has important methodological implications, since theoretical studies often assume normal or uniform distributions to study ecological stability, and therefore might overlook stabilising mechanisms. We conclude that since skewed interaction strengths are a common feature of ecological networks, they can be expected to play an important role in the relation between structure and stability in living systems.

## A Kv2 inhibitor combination reveals native neuronal conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromers

**Abstract:**
KvS proteins are voltage-gated potassium channel subunits that form functional channels when assembled into heteromers with Kv2.1 (KCNB1) or Kv2.2 (KCNB2). Mammals have 10 KvS subunits: Kv5.1 (KCNF1), Kv6.1 (KCNG1), Kv6.2 (KCNG2), Kv6.3 (KCNG3), Kv6.4 (KCNG4), Kv8.1 (KCNV1), Kv8.2 (KCNV2), Kv9.1 (KCNS1), Kv9.2 (KCNS2), and Kv9.3 (KCNS3). Electrically excitable cells broadly express channels containing Kv2 subunits and most neurons have substantial Kv2 conductance. However, whether KvS subunits contribute to these conductances has not been clear, leaving the physiological roles of KvS subunits poorly understood. Here, we identify that two potent Kv2 inhibitors, used in combination, can distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers and Kv2-only channels. We find that Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, or Kv9-containing channels are resistant to the Kv2-selective pore-blocker RY785 yet remain sensitive to the Kv2-selective voltage sensor modulator guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX). Using these inhibitors in mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons, we find predominantly RY785-sensitive conductances consistent with channels composed entirely of Kv2 subunits. In contrast, RY785-resistant but GxTX-sensitive conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels predominate in mouse and human dorsal root ganglion neurons. These results establish an approach to pharmacologically distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers from Kv2-only channels, enabling investigation of the physiological roles of endogenous KvS subunits. These findings suggest that drugs which distinguish KvS subunits could modulate electrical activity of subsets of Kv2-expressing cell types.

## Unlocking prophage potential: In silico and experimental analysis of a novel Mycobacterium fortuitum LysinB containing a peptidoglycan-binding domain

**Abstract:**
Endolysins are highly evolved bacteriophage-encoded lytic enzymes produced to damage the bacterial cell wall for phage progeny release. They offer promising potential as highly specific lytic proteins with a low chance of bacterial resistance. The diversity in lysin sequences and domain organization can be staggering. In silico analysis of bacteriophage and prophage genomes can help identify endolysins exhibiting unique features and high antibacterial activity, hence feeding the pipeline of narrow-spectrum protein antibiotics. Mycobacteriophage lysis cassettes mostly have two lytic enzymes, LysinA and LysinB. The enzyme LysinA targets peptidoglycan in the cell wall and possesses a modular architecture. LysinB typically contains a single domain and acts upon the mycolyl ester linkages in mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (Payne et al., 2010). This study aimed to find novel LysinBs against Mycobacterium fortuitum. After a detailed in silico characterization of lysis cassettes from three M. fortuitum prophages, we chose to work on a LysinB (hereafter described as LysinB_MF) found in an incomplete prophage (phiE1336, 9.4 kb in strain E1336). LysinB_MF showed low sequence similarity with any other endolysins in the database and formed a separate clade on phylogenetic analysis. LysinB_MFs structure, extracted from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, demonstrated a modular architecture with two structurally distinct domains: a peptidoglycan-binding domain (PGBD) at the N-terminal and the characteristic alpha/beta hydrolase domain connected via a linker peptide. We found the alpha/beta hydrolase domain, which is the enzyme-active domain (EAD), contains the conserved Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad with a tunnel-like topology and forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The PGBD shows structural similarity to the cell-wall binding domain of an amidase from Clostridium acetobutylicum, hinting at its acquisition due to domain mobility. Our in silico electrostatic potential analysis suggested that PGBD might be essential to the enzyme activity. Based on our analysis, PGBD emerged as an integral constituent of enzymes with diverse functional properties and is predicted to be conserved cross-kingdom. Overall, this study highlights the importance of mining mycobacterial prophages as a novel endolysin source. It also provides unique insights into the diverse architecture of mycobacteriophage-encoded endolysins and the importance of functional domains for their catalytic activities.

**Abstract:**
Emotional experiences are never static but continuously evolve in response to internal and external contexts. Little is known about how neural patterns change as a function of these experiences, particularly in response to complex, real-world stimuli. This study aimed to identify generalizable neural patterns as individuals collectively engage and disengage from emotions dynamically. To do so, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with subjective emotional annotations from two independent studies as individuals watched negative and neutral movie clips. We used predictive modeling to test if a model trained to predict a group emotional signature response in one study generalizes to the other study and vice versa. Disengagement patterns generalized specifically across intense clips. They were supported by connections within and between the sensorimotor and salience networks, maybe reflecting the processing of feeling states as individuals regulate their emotions. Prediction success for the engagement signature was mixed, primarily linked to connections within the visual and between the visual and dorsal attention networks, supporting visual attention orienting as emotions intensify. This work offers potential pathways for identifying generalizable neural patterns contributing to future affective research and clinical applications aiming to better understand dynamic emotional responses to naturalistic stimuli.

## The MAP2Ks can use ADP to phosphorylate and activate their substrate MAPKs in vitro

**Abstract:**
Kinases are a diverse group of enzymes that use ATP to phosphorylate a variety of substrates. Protein kinases evolved in eukaryotes as important mediators of cell signalling that target specific amino acid side chains to modulate downstream protein function. Among them, the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) are a family of intracellular protein kinases that form signalling cascades responding to a number of stimuli, that control fundamental mechanisms such as proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and cell death. Signals propagate through consecutive kinases which eventually phosphorylate and activate a MAPK. Here, we show that the dual specificity threonine/tyrosine MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks or MEKs) are able to phosphorylate and activate their substrate MAPKs using ADP as well as ATP in vitro. As the pathways are involved in the stress response, we speculate that it would represent an advantage to be able to maintain signalling under conditions such as hypoxia, that occur under a number of cell stresses, including cancer and atherosclerosis, where the available pool of ATP could be depleted.

**Abstract:**
Studies of in vivo chromatin organization have relied on the accessibility of the underlying DNA to nucleases or methyltransferases, which is limited by their requirement for purified nuclei and enzymatic treatment. Here, we introduce a nanopore-based sequencing technique called Small-Molecule Adduct sequencing (SMAdd-seq), where we profile chromatin accessibility by treating nuclei or intact cells with a small molecule, angelicin. Angelicin reacts with thymine bases in linker DNA not bound to core nucleosomes after UV light exposure, thereby labeling accessible DNA regions. By applying SMAdd-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that angelicin-modified DNA can be detected by its distinct nanopore current signals. To systematically identify angelicin modifications and analyze chromatin structure, we developed a neural network model, NEural network for mapping MOdifications in nanopore long-reads (NEMO). NEMO accurately called expected nucleosome occupancy patterns near transcription start sites at both bulk and single-molecule levels. We observe heterogeneity in chromatin structure and identify clusters of single-molecule reads with varying configurations at specific yeast loci. Furthermore, SMAdd-seq performs equivalently on purified yeast nuclei and intact cells, indicating the promise of this method for in vivo chromatin labeling on long single molecules to measure native chromatin dynamics and heterogeneity.

**Abstract:**
Understanding how the eyes, head, and hands coordinate in natural contexts is a critical challenge in visuomotor coordination research, often constrained by sedentary or restricted tasks and cued actions. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment where participants self-generated pick-and-place actions in a virtual environment, recording concurrent gaze and body movements. Subjects exhibited intricate translation and rotation movements of the eyes, head, and hands during the task. We employed time-dependent principal component analysis to study the relationship between the movements of the eyes, head, and hands relative to action onset. We reduced the overall dimensionality into 2D representations, capturing up to 65\% of the movement variance just in time with the actions. Our analysis revealed the eyes synchronized with the head and hands close to action onset, with variations in coupling observed in horizontal and vertical planes, indicating distinct mechanisms for coordination in the brain. Crucially, the head and hands remained tightly coupled throughout the observation period, suggesting a shared neural code driving these effectors. Notably, the low-dimensional representations of the eye-head-hand movement vectors showed maximum predictive accuracy of the upcoming action location ~200 ms before onset, highlighting just-in-time coordination among the three effectors. Furthermore, predictive accuracy was significantly influenced by the location of the upcoming action. Our study emphasizes differential visuomotor control shaped by task structure, providing insights into the dynamic interplay of eye, head, and hand movements during natural behavior.

## Heterogeneous efflux pump expression underpins phenotypic resistance to antimicrobial peptides

**Abstract:**
Antimicrobial resistance threatens the viability of modern medical interventions. There is a dire need of developing novel approaches to counter resistance mechanisms employed by starved or slow-growing pathogens that are refractory to conventional antimicrobial therapies. Antimicrobial peptides have been advocated as potential therapeutic solutions due to low levels of genetic resistance observed in bacteria against these compounds. However, here we show that subpopulations of stationary phase Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survive tachyplesin treatment without genetic mutations. These phenotypic variants display enhanced efflux activity to limit intracellular peptide accumulation. Differential regulation of genes involved in outer membrane vesicle section, membrane modification, and protease activity were also found between phenotypically resistant and susceptible cells. We discovered that formation of these phenotypic variants could be prevented by administering tachyplesin in combination with sertraline, a clinically used antidepressant, suggesting a novel approach for combatting antimicrobial-refractory stationary phase bacteria.

## High-resolution detection of copy number alterations in single cells with HiScanner

**Abstract:**
Improvements in single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) assays have enabled detailed characterization of somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) at the single-cell level. Yet, current computational methods are mostly designed for detecting chromosome-scale changes in cancer samples with low sequencing coverage. Here, we introduce HiScanner (High-resolution Single-Cell Allelic copy Number callER), which combines read depth, B-allele frequency, and haplotype phasing to identify CNAs with high resolution. In simulated data, HiScanner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various CNA types and sizes. When applied to high-coverage scWGS data from 65 cells across 11 neurotypical human brains, HiScanner shows a superior ability to detect smaller CNAs, uncovering distinct CNA patterns between neurons and oligodendrocytes. We also generated low-coverage scWGS data from 179 cells sampled from the same meningioma patient at two time points. For this serial dataset, integration of CNAs with point mutations revealed evolutionary trajectories of tumor cells. These findings show that HiScanner enables accurate characterization of frequency, clonality, and distribution of CNAs at the single-cell level in both non-neoplastic and neoplastic cells.

## Mimicking opioid analgesia in cortical pain circuits

**Abstract:**
The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural computations to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviors and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep-learning behavioral analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective-motivational behaviors without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic mu-opioid receptor promoter to drive chemogenetic inhibition in opioid-responsive ACC neurons. This targeted neuromodulation recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain. This opioid-mimetic gene therapy offers a new strategy for precision pain management by targeting a key nociceptive cortical circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

## Insights into the bioluminescence systems of three sea pens (Cnidaria: Anthozoa): from de novo transcriptome analyses to biochemical assays

**Abstract:**
Bioluminescence is the production of visible light by living organisms. It occurs through the oxidation of a luciferin substrate catalysed by luciferase enzymes. Auxiliary proteins, such as fluorescent proteins and luciferin-binding proteins, can modify the light emitted wavelength or stabilize reactive luciferin molecules, respectively. Additionally, calcium ions are crucial for the luminescence across various species. Despite the large phylogenetic distribution of bioluminescent organisms, only a few systems have been comprehensively studied. Notably, cnidarian species of the Renilla genus utilize a coelenterazine-dependent luciferase, a calcium-dependent coelenterazine-binding protein and a green fluorescent protein. We investigated the bioluminescence of three sea pen species: Pennatula phosphorea, Anthoptilum murrayi and Funiculina quadrangularis (Pennatuloidea, Anthozoa). Their light-emission spectra reveal peaks at 510, 513 and 485 nm, respectively. A coelenterazine-based reaction was demonstrated in all three species. Using transcriptome analyses, we identified predicted transcripts coding for luciferases, green fluorescent proteins and coelenterazine-binding proteins for P. phosphorea and A. murrayi. Immunodetection confirmed the expression of luciferase in P. phosphorea and F. quadrangularis. We also expressed recombinant luciferase of A. murrayi, confirming its activity. We highlighted the role of calcium ions in bioluminescence, possibly associated with the mechanism of substrate release at the level of coelenterazine-binding proteins. The study proposes a model for anthozoan bioluminescence, offering new avenues for future ecological and functional research on these luminous organisms.

## Intradental mechano-nociceptors serve as sentinels that prevent tooth damage

**Abstract:**
Pain is the anticipated output of the trigeminal sensory neurons that innervate the tooth's vital interior; however, the contribution of intradental neurons to healthy tooth sensation has yet to be defined. Here, we employ in vivo Ca2+ imaging to identify and define a population of myelinated high-threshold mechano-nociceptors (intradental HTMRs) that detect superficial structural damage of the tooth, produce pain, and initiate a jaw opening reflex. Intradental HTMRs remain inactive when direct forces are applied to the intact tooth but become responsive to forces when the structural integrity of the tooth is compromised, and the dentin or pulp is exposed. Their terminals collectively innervate the inner dentin through overlapping receptive fields, allowing them to monitor the superficial structures of the tooth. Indeed, intradental HTMRs detect superficial enamel damage and encode its degree, and their responses persist in the absence of either PIEZO2 or Nav1.8. As predicted, chemogenetic activation of intradental HTMRs results in a marked pain phenotype like that produced by systemic chemogenetic activation of nociceptors. Remarkably, optogenetic activation of intradental HTMRs triggers a rapid, jaw opening reflex via contraction of the digastric muscle. Taken together, our data indicate that intradental HTMRs serve as sentinels that guard against mechanical threats to the tooth; their activation not only triggers pain, but also results in physical tooth separation, which would prevent damage during mastication. Our work provides a new perspective of intradental neurons, highlighting their protective role, and illustrates the functional diversity of interoreceptors.

## Embodied decisions as active inference

**Abstract:**
Decision-making is often conceptualized as a serial process, during which sensory evidence is accumulated for the choice alternatives until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made and an action is executed. This decide-then-act perspective has successfully explained various facets of perceptual and economic decisions in the laboratory, in which action dynamics are usually irrelevant to the choice. However, living organisms often face another class of decisions -- called embodied decisions -- that require selecting between potential courses of actions to be executed timely in a dynamic environment, e.g., for a lion, deciding which gazelle to chase and how fast to do so. Studies of embodied decisions reveal two aspects of goal-directed behavior in stark contrast to the serial view. First, that decision and action processes can unfold in parallel; second, that action-related components, such as the motor costs associated with selecting a particular choice alternative or required to ``change mind'' between choice alternatives, exert a feedback effect on the decision taken. Here, we show that these signatures of embodied decisions emerge naturally in active inference -- a framework that simultaneously optimizes perception and action, according to the same (free energy minimization) imperative. We show that optimizing embodied choices requires a continuous feedback loop between motor planning (where beliefs about choice alternatives guide action dynamics) and motor inference (where action dynamics finesse beliefs about choice alternatives). Furthermore, our active inference simulations reveal the normative character of embodied decisions in ecological settings -- namely, achieving an effective balance between a high accuracy and a low risk of missing valid opportunities.

## Loss of mitochondrial pyruvate transport initiates cardiac glycogen accumulation and heart failure

**Abstract:**
Heart failure involves metabolic alterations including increased glycolysis despite unchanged or decreased glucose oxidation. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) regulates pyruvate entry into the mitochondrial matrix, and cardiac deletion of the MPC in mice causes heart failure. How MPC deletion results in heart failure is unknown. We performed targeted metabolomics and isotope tracing in wildtype (fl/fl) and cardiac-specific Mpc2-/- (CS-Mpc2-/-) hearts after in vivo injection of U-13C-glucose. Failing CS-Mpc2-/- hearts contained normal levels of ATP and phosphocreatine, yet these hearts displayed increased enrichment from U-13C-glucose and increased glycolytic metabolite pool sizes. 13C enrichment and pool size was also increased for the glycogen intermediate UDP-glucose, as well as increased enrichment of the glycogen pool. Glycogen levels were increased ~6-fold in the failing CS-Mpc2-/- hearts, and glycogen granules were easily detected by electron microscopy. In young, non-failing CS-Mpc2-/- hearts, increased glycolytic 13C enrichment occurred, but glycogen levels remained low and unchanged compared to fl/fl hearts. Inhibiting glycogen synthase with MZ-101 reduced cardiac glycogen levels and improved heart failure. Feeding a ketogenic diet to CS-Mpc2-/- mice reversed the heart failure and normalized the cardiac glycogen and glycolytic metabolite accumulation. Cardiac glycogen levels were also elevated in mice infused with angiotensin-II, and both the cardiac hypertrophy and glycogen levels were improved by ketogenic diet. Thus, loss of MPC in the heart causes glycogen accumulation and heart failure, while inhibition of glycogen synthesis or a ketogenic diet can reverse both the glycogen accumulation and heart failure.

## On the potential for GWAS with phenotypic population means and allele-frequency data (popGWAS)

**Abstract:**
It is vital to understand the genomic basis of differences in ecologically important traits if we are to understand the impact of global change on biodiversity and enhance our ability for targeted intervention. This study explores the potential of a novel genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach for identifying loci underlying quantitative polygenic traits in natural populations, based on phenotypic population means and genome-wide allele frequency data as obtained e.g. by PoolSeq approaches. Extensive population genetic forward simulations demonstrate that the approach is generally effective for oligogenic and moderately polygenic traits and relatively insensitive to low heritability. However, applicability is limited for highly polygenic architectures and pronounced population structure. The required sample size is moderate with very good results being obtained already for a few dozen populations scored. When combined with machine learning for feature selection, the method performs very well in predicting population means. The data efficiency of the method, particularly when using pooled sequencing and bulk phenotyping, makes GWAS studies more accessible for research in biodiversity genomics. Moreover, in a direct comparison to individual based GWAS, the proposed method performed constistently better with regard to the number of true positive loci identified and prediction accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the promise of popGWAS for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in natural populations.

**Abstract:**
Supervised machine learning models depend on training datasets with positive and negative examples. Therefore, dataset composition directly impacts model performance and bias. Given the importance of machine learning for immunotherapeutic design, we examined how different negative class definitions affect model generalization and rule discovery for antibody-antigen binding. Using synthetic structure-based binding data, we evaluated models trained with various definitions of negative sets. Our findings reveal that high out-of-distribution performance can be achieved when the negative dataset contains more similar samples to the positive dataset despite a lower within-distribution performance. Furthermore, leveraging ground truth information, we show that binding rules discovered as associated with positive data change based on the negative data used. Validation on experimental data supported simulation-based observations. This work underscores the role of dataset composition, including negative data selection, in creating robust, generalizable, and biology-aware sequence-based ML models.

**Abstract:**
Humans are the only species with the ability to convey an unbounded number of novel thoughts by combining words into sentences. This process is guided by complex semantic and abstract syntactic representations. Despite their centrality to human cognition, the neural mechanisms underlying these systems remain obscured by inherent limitations of non-invasive brain measures and a near total focus on comprehension paradigms. Here, we address these limitations with high-resolution neurosurgical recordings (electrocorticography) and a controlled sentence production experiment. We uncover distinct cortical networks encoding word-level, semantic, and syntactic information. These networks are broadly distributed across traditional language areas, but with focal sensitivity to syntactic structure in middle and inferior frontal gyri. In contrast to previous findings from comprehension studies, these networks are largely non-overlapping, each specialized for just one of the three linguistic constructs we investigate. Most strikingly, our data reveal an unexpected property of higher-order linguistic information: it is encoded independent of neural activity levels. We propose that this "magnitude-independent coding" scheme represents a novel mechanism for encoding information, reserved for higher-order cognition more broadly.

**Abstract:**
Addressing challenges in domain invariance within single-cell genomics necessitates innovative strategies to manage the heterogeneity of multi-source datasets while maintaining the integrity of biological signals. We introduce TarDis, a novel deep generative model designed to disentangle intricate covariate structures across diverse biological datasets, distinguishing technical artifacts from true biological variations. By employing tailored covariate-specific loss components and a self-supervised approach, TarDis effectively generates multiple latent space representations that capture each continuous and categorical target covariate separately, along with unexplained variation. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TarDis outperforms existing methods in data integration, covariate disentanglement, and robust out-of-distribution predictions. The models capacity to produce interpretable and structured latent spaces, including its pioneering work in ordered latent representations for continuous covariates, markedly enhances its utility in hypothesis-driven research. Consequently, TarDis offers a promising analytical platform for advancing scientific discovery, providing insights into cellular dynamics, and enabling targeted therapeutic interventions.

Progress and potentialModern single-cell genomics provides an unprecedented view into cellular heterogeneity, yet the very richness that propels new discoveries also complicates downstream analysis. Gene-expression patterns emerge from overlapping biological processes (e.g., differentiation programs, disease progression) and extrinsic factors (e.g., laboratory protocols, technical artifacts). Disentanglement, in this context, aims to parse these intertwined influences into interpretable latent representations, a crucial step for elucidating how complex covariates shape cellular states. While methods that correct for batch effects have become standard, these strategies often fall short in achieving the deeper objective of capturing subtle, high-dimensional biological dynamics. In single-cell experiments, cells navigate intricate developmental trajectories, respond nonlinearly to environmental or pharmaceutical perturbations, and exhibit myriad context-specific behaviors. Without disentanglement, these diverse signals frequently remain intermingled, limiting biological interpretability and hindering hypothesis-driven research.

Disentangling biological covariates is particularly vital for addressing nuanced questions in single-cell research. For example, in a disease model involving multiple genetic variants and variable drug dosing, researchers may wish to examine the effect of each variant independently or investigate how dosage influences a specific mutant background. Similarly, in developmental biology, uncovering how cells evolve across a continuum of pseudotime (e.g., from pluripotent to fully differentiated states) is critical for identifying the genes that orchestrate fate decisions while isolating the influence of developmental time from tissue-specific contexts, along with other confounding factors such as culture conditions, sample preparation, or donor genetic characteristics. Alternatively, disentangling lineage commitment signals from spatial patterning cues enables the identification of master regulators driving fate decisions. Moreover, by explicitly isolating and representing each covariate as an independent latent dimension, one can systematically navigate and interrogate a rich multidimensional covariate space. This approach extends beyond merely observing biological states, it enables exploration of novel or unmeasured cellular conditions through latent-space manipulations. For instance, disentangled latent spaces could allow researchers to computationally predict cellular responses at drug dosages or developmental stages that were never experimentally observed, significantly broadening the scope and predictive power of experimental datasets. Such analyses yield testable hypotheses for unexplored biological phenomena and enable informed planning of subsequent experimental validations.

The challenge of covariate disentanglement stems fundamentally from the complexity of modeling joint distributions of gene expression conditioned simultaneously on multiple covariates, both categorical (e.g., tissue type, disease condition) and continuous (e.g., pseudotime, dosage). This is inherently an underdetermined problem because single-cell measurements represent only sparse snapshots within a vast combinatorial space of covariate conditions. Conventional modeling approaches often conflate correlated covariates, collapsing biological variability into ambiguous latent factors, and typically fail to explicitly create separate latent representations for disentangled covariates. Moreover, continuous covariates introduce an additional layer of complexity; yet discretizing them artificially imposes arbitrary boundaries, obscuring subtle transitions and hindering accurate capture of biological gradients. Therefore, preserving the continuous nature of such covariates in disentangled representations is critical, as it maintains their intrinsic ordering and enables researchers to discern nuanced biological shifts--such as identifying thresholds in dose-response relationships or characterizing gradual developmental transitions--in a naturally interpretable manner.

The key idea in this paper is to devise a tailored deep generative model for systematically separating both categorical and continuous covariates into independent latent dimensions, while still ensuring coherent integration of the underlying gene-expression data. By explicitly targeting these covariates and preserving continuous variables as smooth, ordered latent axes, our approach clarifies complex interactions and uncovers nuanced patterns that remain concealed under standard analyses. The resulting disentangled representations can then support robust out-of-distribution generalizations, refined differential analyses, and more principled hypotheses about how diverse factors interact to drive cellular variation.

## Learning and cognition in highspeed decision making

**Abstract:**
It is widely accepted that more time and information yield better decisions. However, some decisions manage to combine speed and accuracy in an unusual way. Potentially their trick could be to use simplifying heuristics that works well for the most common condition but would lack flexibility otherwise. Here we describe an unexpected level of flexibility in a complex highspeed decision that is made faster than an Olympic sprinter can respond to the start gun. In this decision, archerfish observe the initial speed, direction, and height of falling prey and then use these initial values to turn right towards were ballistically falling prey would later land. To analyze the limits in flexibility of this highspeed decision we first developed and critically tested a system that allowed us to replace the usual ballistic relation between initial prey motion and the expected landing point with another deterministic rule. We discovered that, surprisingly, adult fish could reprogram their highspeed decision to the new rule. Moreover, after reprogramming their decision fish were immediately able to generalize their decision to novel untrained settings, showing a remarkable degree of abstraction in how the decision circuit represented the novel rule. The decision circuit is even capable of simultaneously using two distinct sets of rules, one for each of two visually distinct objects. The flexibility and level of cognition are unexpected for a decision that lacks a speed-accuracy tradeoff and is made in less than 100 ms. Our findings demonstrate the enormous potential highspeed decision making can have and strongly suggest that we presently underappreciate this form of decision making.

## Longitudinal trajectories of brain development from infancy to school age and their relationship to literacy development

**Abstract:**
Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures supports long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and home literacy environment, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to second-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop early in infancy but undergo further refinement between birth and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.

**Abstract:**
Structural heterogeneity due to varying compostions and dynamic conformations of macromolecules in cellular environment in situ presents significant challenges to biological discovery by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). In this paper, we present OPUS-TOMO, a unified deep learning framework for analyzing structural heterogeneity throughout the cryo-ET workflow. The method adopts a convolutional Encoder-Decoder architecture that adeptly maps real-space subtomograms onto a smooth low-dimensional latent space, allowing capture of the complete landscape of compositional and conformational variations of macromolecules in cryoET data. OPUS-TOMO also incorporates multiple effective techniques such as a per-particle 3D CTF model and an end-to-end pose correction network specifically for cryo-ET data. Applications of OPUS-TOMO to several real cryo-ET datasets demonstrate its outstanding capacities in resolving structural heterogeneity at various stages of cryo-ET reconstruction. The development of advanced methodologies such as OPUS-TOMO would potentially accelerate the quest for understanding biological mechanisms in situ on a proteomic scale at molecular levels in the broad tomography community. The software is available at https://github.com/alncat/opusTOMO.

**Abstract:**
Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2), a core component of the hPrP19 complex, plays an important role in RNA-splicing and DNA damage. However, whether BCAS2 has other functions within the nucleus remains largely unknown. Here, we show that BCAS2 is essential for primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish and mouse embryos. The activation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signal, which is required for hematopoietic progenitor differentiation, is significantly decreased upon depletion of bcas2 in zebrafish embryos and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency of bcas2 has no obvious impact on the splicing efficiency of {beta}-catenin pre-mRNA, while significantly attenuating {beta}-catenin nuclear accumulation. Moreover, we find that BCAS2 directly binds to {beta}-catenin via its coiled-coil domains, thereby sequestering {beta}-catenin within the nucleus. Thus, our results uncover a previously unknown function of BCAS2 in promoting Wnt signaling by enhancing {beta}-catenin nuclear retention during primitive hematopoiesis.

**Abstract:**
Tracking and understanding the movements of animals in the wild is a fast-growing area of research, known as movement ecology. However, tracking small animals such as flying insects, which cannot easily carry an electronic tag, remains challenging as existing field methods are costly either in terms of equipment or tracking effort (e.g. VHF radio-tracking, scanning harmonic radar). Here we attempted to record the movements of free-flying butterflies from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), maintaining a static position in the sky and recording video vertically downwards. With an appropriate flight height and image filtering algorithm, we recorded 166 flight tracks of Pieris butterflies (P. brassicae and P. rapae), with a median tracking length of 40 m (median flight duration 13 s), and a high temporal resolution of 30 positions per second. Average flight direction varied significantly over the course of the flying season, from a northward azimuth in June and early July, to a southward azimuth in September, congruent with a trans-generational migratory behaviour that has previously been documented by field observations or experiments in flight cages. In addition, UAV imagery unlocks the possibility to measure high-resolution flight movement patterns (e.g. path tortuosity and transverse oscillations), which will possibly help understand perceptual and locomotor mechanisms underlying spatial behaviour. We explore the technical details associated with UAV tracking methodology, and discuss its limitations, in particular the biases associated with a 2D projection of 3D flight movements, the limited spatial scale, and the difficulty to distinguish between visually similar species, such as P. brassicae and P. rapae.

**Abstract:**
Seeds harbor diverse microbial communities important for plant growth and health. During germination, seed exudation triggers intense microbial competition, shaping the communities transmitted to seedlings. This study explores the role of the bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS)-mediated interference competition in seed microbiota transmission to seedlings. The analysis of T6SS distribution within 180 genome sequences of seed-borne bacterial strains enabled the construction of synthetic communities (SynCom) with different levels of phylogenetic diversity and T6SS richness. These SynComs were inoculated with Stenotrophomonas rhizophila CFBP13503, a bacterial strain possessing an active T6SS in vitro and in planta. The impact of T6SS on SynCom composition was assessed in vitro by comparing CFBP13503 wild-type strain or its isogenic T6SS-deficient mutant co-inoculation. Additionally, the effects of T6SS on bacterial community dynamics during seed-to-seedling transmission were examined following seed-inoculation. The T6SS of S. rhizophila CFBP13503 targets a broad range of bacteria belonging to 5 different orders. The susceptibility of competing bacteria was partly explained by their phylogenetic proximity and metabolic overlap with CFBP13503. Furthermore, the T6SS modulates the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa during seed-to-seedling transmission, depending on the initial seed inoculum and plant developmental stage. Depending on the sensitivity of the co-inoculated competitors, the T6SS can provide a competitive advantage to CFBP13503, resulting in an increase in population size.

ImportanceThe high prevalence of T6SS in seed-borne bacteria supports the importance of T6SS-mediated competition for seed microbiota assembly. In vitro, S. rhizophila CFBP13503 T6SS exerts a strong impact on bacterial community dynamics. The susceptibility to T6SS increases with the phylogenetic and metabolic proximity of bacteria to CFBP13503, suggesting an influence of interspecies trophic patterns in T6SS-mediated competitions. In planta and in soil, CFBP13503 T6SS influences specific bacterial taxa, leading to shifts in bacterial interactions and distinct community dynamics. T6SS-mediated competition plays a pivotal role in shaping seed bacterial communities and the dynamics of seed-to-seedling transitions.

**Abstract:**
Bovine fasciolosis is a parasitic disease of cattle caused by ingesting metacercariae of liver flukes from the genus Fasciola. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2021 to April 2022, encompassing a total of 384 cattle randomly selected from diverse locations. The study included cattle of various ages and sexes, aiming to assess the prevalence of bovine fasciolosis and identify risk factors in and around Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. Fecal examinations were performed to detect fluke eggs, and data were analyzed using descriptive statistics in STATA Version 20.0 to summarize the prevalence of bovine fasciolosis. Chi-square tests assessed relationships between infection rates and risk factors, with significance set at P < 0.05. The overall prevalence of fasciolosis was found to be 49.21%. Analysis by origin revealed that Sebatamit had the highest prevalence at 61.84%, followed by Kebele 11 at 59.37%, Tikurit at 50%, and Latammba at 27.65%. Statistical analysis showed significant differences in prevalence among the locations. In terms of body condition, cattle in poor condition had the highest prevalence (64%), followed by those in medium condition (50%) and fat cattle (26.96%). This variation was statistically significant. Age group analysis showed similar prevalence rates, with young cattle at 50.38%, adults at 47.33%, and older cattle at 50.47%, with no significant differences observed. Sex-related differences in prevalence were also not significant, with males showing a prevalence of 49.73% and females 48.73%. Regarding breed, local cattle exhibited a slightly higher prevalence (51.62%) compared to crossbreeds (46.15%), but this difference was not statistically significant ( > 0.05). In conclusion, the study highlights significant variations in the prevalence of bovine fasciolosis based on location and body condition, while no significant differences were observed among age, sex, and breed groups. These findings emphasize the importance of location-specific interventions and proper management of cattle health to control the spread of fasciolosis.

**Abstract:**
Fasciolosis is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. It is a serious public health and veterinary concern, with significant consequences for both human and livestock populations. An abattoir-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January to September 2023 at Gondar ELFORA Abattoir, Ethiopia, to assess hematobiochemical alterations and pathological lesions induced by fasciolosis in slaughtered cattle. The study involved one hundred apparently healthy male local breed cattle, evenly split into fifty infected and fifty non-infected individuals, using a purposive sampling technique. Findings showed lower mean values for hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), total erythrocyte count (TEC), lymphocytes, monocytes, total protein, albumin, and glucose. Conversely, they had higher mean values for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total leukocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, eosinophils, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Basophil levels were similar in both groups. Liver alterations observed included hepatomegaly with rounded edges and the presence of juvenile flukes in the cut section of the parenchyma. In chronic cases, the liver appeared smaller, with a firm consistency, a corrugated capsule, and dilated bile ducts containing twisted flukes. Microscopically, during the acute phase, there was infiltration of eosinophils, hemosiderin pigmentation, and congestion around the central vein and sinusoids. In contrast, chronic cases exhibited fibrosis, proliferation of bile ducts, and metaplasia of columnar to cuboidal epithelial cells. The results of hematobiochemical alterations were consistent with gross and microscopic findings, indicating a significant impact on liver physiology and histology, leading to substantial losses in meat and milk production.

**Abstract:**
Age-related cognitive decline associations with human electroencephalography (EEG) have previously focused on periodic activity. However, EEG is primarily made up of non-oscillatory aperiodic activity, which can be characterized with an exponent and offset value. In a secondary analysis of a cohort of 111 healthy participants aged 17-71 years, we examined the associations of the aperiodic exponent and offset with a battery of cognitive tests consisting of the Colour-Word Interference Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV Digit Span Test, Rey Auditory Learning Test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Trial Making Test, and the Verbal Fluency Test. Using Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering, we identified clusters of electrodes that exhibited similar aperiodic exponent and offset activity during resting-state eyes-closed EEG. Robust linear models were then used to model how aperiodic activity interacted with age and their associations with performance during each cognitive test. Offset by age interactions were identified for the Verbal Fluency Test, where smaller offsets were associated with poorer performance in adults as early as 33 years of age. Greater aperiodic activity is increasingly related to better verbal fluency performance with age in adulthood.

## Improving Protein Interaction Prediction in GenPPi: A Novel Interaction Sampling Approach Preserving Network Topology

**Abstract:**
Computational prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding cell biology and drug development, offering a promising alternative to costly and time-consuming experimental methods. While the original GenPPi software represented an advance in ab initio PPI network prediction from bacterial genomes, its reliance on high sequence similarity limited it. In this work, we introduce the GenPPi 1.5 and enhance prediction capabilities. We incorporated a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, trained on 60 biophysical features derived from amino acid propensity indices, to overcome the previous limitation by classifying protein similarity even in low sequence identity scenarios (targeting > 65% identity). Furthermore, to address the computational complexity arising from the increased number of potential interactions generated by the RF model, especially within extensive conserved phylogenetic profiles, we developed and integrated the Reduced Interaction Sampling (RIS) algorithm. RIS stochastically samples interactions within these extensive profiles, optimizing performance for complete genome analysis. Our multifaceted methodology included integrating RF for efficient similarity classification and implementing RIS to reduce the computational burden. We evaluated the effectiveness through extensive simulations across different configurations (operational modes, Top N selected nodes, number of analyzed genomes). We rigorously assessed the network stability and structural integrity using topological metrics and statistical tests. Results demonstrate that RF integration significantly broadens GenPPi's predictive power. Application to the Buchnera aphidicola genome revealed an overlap of up to 62% with interactions documented in the STRING database, validating prediction accuracy. Analysis of the RIS algorithm showed that while introducing some randomness, critical node identification remains robust, particularly for Top N values [&ge;] 100, indicating that the edge reduction does not significantly compromise network integrity. In conclusion, combining Machine Learning and RIS represents a significant advancement. GenPPi 1.5 overcomes the high-similarity dependency while efficiently handling complex genomes, providing a robust and scalable alignment-free solution for PPI prediction. GenPPi is available at https://genppi.facom.ufu.br/ and on GitHub: https://github.com/santosardr/genppi and allows users to train custom models for specific genomic contexts.

**Abstract:**
Exercise is a multipotent stimulus that results in large-scale dynamic changes to the systemic molecular profile. Alternative exercise prescriptions and doses would be expected to result in distinct signatures due to differences in duration and intensity. We tested two novel combined endurance and resistance exercise regimens to better understand how differing prescriptions alter the acute metabolomics response at multiple timepoints up to 24h post-exercise. Serum metabolomics for n=37 untrained individuals was analyzed for participants completing traditional combined exercise [TRAD; n = 20 (11M/9F)] or high-intensity tactical training [HITT; n= 17 (8M/9F)] before exercise (pre), and immediately (h0), 3 and 24 h post-exercise (h3 and h24, respectively). We found minimal metabolites had a group by time interaction (2 with FDR < 0.10; 31 with nominal p < 0.05;), but both stimuli resulted in large-scale within-group changes to the circulating metabolome. TRAD consistently had greater numbers of differentially abundant metabolites (FDR < 0.10) as compared to HITT at h0 (431 vs. 333), h3 (435 vs. 331) and h24 (168 vs. 76). The major metabolite classes altered were related to key energy substrates for both groups at h0 (e.g., glucose, pyruvate) and energy replenishment for h3 and h24 (e.g., 12,13 diHOME, palmitoylcarnitine, free fatty acids). In summary, our data are the first to describe the acute changes in the circulating metabolome following combined endurance and resistance exercise. Additionally, we show the two distinct doses of combined exercise led to generally similar patterns of responses, with the longer duration TRAD dose resulting in a higher magnitude of change.

**Abstract:**
Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is a promising means to combat drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Infection by phage can select for mutations in bacterial populations that confer resistance against phage infection. However, resistance against phage can yield evolutionary trade-offs of biomedical relevance. Here we report the discovery that infection by certain staphylococcal phages sensitizes different strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to {beta}-lactams, a class of antibiotics against which MRSA is typically resistant. MRSA cells that survive infection by these phages display significant reductions in minimal inhibitory concentration against different {beta}-lactams compared to uninfected bacteria. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that these evolved MRSA strains possess highly modulated transcriptional profiles, where numerous genes involved in S. aureus virulence were downregulated. Phage-treated MRSA exhibited attenuated virulence phenotypes in the form of reduced hemolysis and clumping. Despite sharing similar phenotypes, whole-sequencing analysis revealed that the different MRSA strains evolved unique genetic profiles during infection. These results suggest complex evolutionary trajectories in MRSA during phage predation and open up new possibilities to reduce drug resistance and virulence in MRSA infections.

**Abstract:**
Intravital microscopy (IVM) enables live imaging of animals at single-cell resolution, offering essential insights into cancer progression. This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological and dynamic single cell features. BEHAV3D-TP is user-friendly and integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data without advanced computational expertise. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.

**Abstract:**
Caveolin is a monotopic integral membrane protein, widely expressed in metazoa and responsible for constructing enigmatic membrane invaginations known as caveolae. Recently, the high-resolution structure of a purified human caveolin assembly, the CAV1-8S complex, revealed a unique organization of 11 protomers arranged in a tightly packed, radially symmetric spiral disc. One face and the outer rim of this disc are hydrophobic, suggesting that the complex incorporates into membranes by displacing hundreds of lipids from one leaflet. The feasibility of this unique molecular architecture and its biophysical and functional consequences are currently unknown. Using Langmuir film balance measurements, we find that CAV1-8S is highly surface active, intercalating into lipid monolayers of various compositions. CAV1-8S can also incorporate into preformed bilayers, but only upon removal of phospholipids from the outer-facing leaflet. Atomistic and coarse-grained simulations of biomimetic bilayers support this  leaflet replacement model and also reveal that CAV1-8S accumulates 40-70 cholesterol molecules into a disordered monolayer between the complex and its distal lipid leaflet. We find that CAV1-8S preferentially associates with positively curved membrane surfaces due to its influence on the conformations of distal leaflet lipids, and that these effects laterally sort lipids. Large-scale simulations of multiple caveolin assemblies confirmed their association with large, positively curved membrane morphologies consistent with the shape of caveolae. Further, association with curved membranes regulates the exposure of caveolin residues implicated in protein-protein interactions. Altogether, the unique structure of CAV1-8S imparts unusual modes of membrane interaction with implications for membrane organization, morphology, and physiology.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECaveolae are membrane invaginations heavily implicated in cellular physiology and disease; however, how their unique shape and function are produced remains enigmatic. Here, following on recent characterization of the unusual structure of the CAV1-8S oligomer, we examine the molecular details of its interactions with its surrounding lipid membrane using simulations and reconstitution experiments. We describe a novel mode of membrane interaction-which we term  leaflet replacement-for the CAV1-8S complex that has not previously been observed for any other protein. The biophysical consequences of this unique molecular organization provide mechanistic insights into the functions and organization of caveolae in cells.

**Abstract:**
Social tolerance can enhance access to resources and is thought to be crucial in facilitating the evolution of cooperation, social cognition and culture, but it is unknown whether animals can optimise their social tolerance through learning. We presented wild jackdaws (Corvus monedula) with a novel social information problem using automated feeders: to access food, adults had to inhibit their tendency to displace juveniles and instead show tolerance by occupying an adjacent perch. Adults learned to tolerate juveniles, generalising across juveniles as a cohort, demonstrating learning of a new information-use strategy. The ability to learn to tolerate those that provide valuable information, and generalise across cohorts of informed individuals, may facilitate adaptive responses in the face of environmental change and help to explain the success of jackdaws in human-dominated environments.

## Microtubule depolymerization at kinetochores restricts anaphase spindle elongation

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
Anaphase chromosome segregation depends on forces exerted by spindle microtubules. Current models propose two mechanisms of force generation: kinetochore microtubules (kMTs) depolymerize to pull chromosomes toward the spindle poles (anaphase A), while antiparallel microtubule sliding in the central spindle further separates the chromosomes by elongating the spindle (anaphase B). Experimental evidence in cells supports the sliding mechanism, but contributions of the depolymerization mechanism remain unclear. Here we show that kMT depolymerization limits spindle elongation rather than moving chromosomes apart. We developed a chemical optogenetic approach to recruit a microtubule depolymerase to kinetochores at anaphase onset, thereby increasing the rate of kMT depolymerization without perturbing earlier stages of mitosis. We find that increased depolymerization slows the velocity at which spindle poles move apart without changing kinetochore separation velocities. Our findings support a model in which kinetochores selectively couple to central spindle microtubules parallel to their kMTs, so that antiparallel sliding drives chromosome segregation while kMT depolymerization pulls poles inward.

**Abstract:**
Although mechanical ventilation is a critical intervention for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it can trigger an IL-1{beta}-associated complication known as ventilator-induced lung injury. In mice, we found that LPS and high-volume ventilation, LPS-HVV, leads to hypoxemia with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in the alveoli. Furthermore, Il1r1-/- LPS-HVV mice did not develop hypoxemia and had reduced NETs, indicating that IL-1R1 signaling is important for NETs formation and hypoxemia. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is known to reduce the release of inflammatory mediators. In LPS-HVV mice, TH (32{degrees}C body temperature) prevented hypoxemia development, reducing albumin leakage, IL-1{beta}, gasdermin D (GSDMD) and NETs formation. We also observed that LPSprimed macrophages, when stimulated at 32{degrees}C with ATP or nigericin, release less IL-1{beta} associated with reduced GSDMD cleavage. Thus, hypothermia is an important modulating factor in the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, IL-1{beta} release and NETs formation, preventing LPS-HVV-induced acute respiratory failure.

## The SET1/COMPASS subunit RBBP5 orchestrates epigenetic control of global proteostasis and the 12h oscillator to safeguard metabolic and cellular homeostasis

**Abstract:**
Proteostasis is vital for cellular health, with disruptions leading to aging, neurodegeneration and metabolic disorders. Traditionally, proteotoxic stress responses were studied as acute reactions to various noxious factors; however, recent evidence reveals that many proteostasis genes exhibit [~]12h ultradian rhythms under physiological conditions in mammals, driven by an XBP1s-dependent 12h oscillator. By examining the chromatin landscape of this oscillator, we identified RBBP5 as an essential epigenetic regulator of global proteostasis dynamics. Mechanistically, as the core subunit of the SET1/COMPASS complex, RBBP5 co-activates XBP1s to facilitate dynamic proteostasis gene expression by marking promoter-proximal H3K4me3, which further recruits the Integrator Complex and SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers. Functionally, RBBP5 is indispensable for regulating both the 12h oscillator and acute transcriptional response to various proteotoxic stresses, including ER stress and nutrient deprivation. RBBP5 ablation causes increased susceptibility to proteotoxic stress, chronic inflammation, and hepatic steatosis in mice, along with impaired autophagy and reduced cell survival in vitro. In humans, lower RBBP5 expression is associated with reduced adaptive stress-response gene expression and hepatic steatosis. Our findings not only highlight a previously unrecognized epigenetic timing mechanism distinct from circadian regulation but also establish RBBP5 as a central regulator of proteostasis, essential for cellular resilience and organismal health.

**Abstract:**
Identification of species for environmental assessment and monitoring is essential for understanding anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity, but for subterranean fauna this task is frequently difficult and time consuming. The implementation of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding for biodiversity discovery and assessment offers considerable promise for improving the rate, accuracy and efficiency of species detection in ecosystems both above and below the ground. Importantly, for a better understanding of the biodiversity and ecology of organisms detected using eDNA, a custom library of known reference sequences with associated correct taxonomic metadata - i.e., a barcode reference library (BRL) - is required. Yet, minimal guidance is currently available on how an effective (i.e. shareable, multi-sequence, that permits metadata and has a unified nomenclature) and accurate (i.e. verified) custom BRL can be achieved. Here, we present a detailed roadmap for curation of a BRL for subterranean fauna. To do this, we (1) curated a custom sequence database of subterranean fauna at an environmentally sensitive location, Bungaroo Creek in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, for four gene loci useful for eDNA metabarcoding (COI, 18S rRNA, 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA); (2) addressed major gaps in taxonomy and disparate nomenclature of subterranean fauna by estimating 17-29 putative new species with standard delimitation methods, including 34 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) in BOLD, and (3) summarised a best practice workflow for curation of a custom BRL that has broad applicability and can be applied to any taxa.

**Abstract:**
Recent studies have identified a family of rod-shaped proteins thought to mediate lipid transfer at intracellular membrane contacts by a bridge-like mechanism. We show one such protein, bridge-like lipid transfer protein 3A (BLTP3A)/UHRF1BP1 binds VAMP7 vesicles via its C-terminal region and anchors them to lysosomes via its chorein domain containing N-terminal region to Rab7. Upon lysosome damage, BLTP3A-positive vesicles rapidly (within minutes) dissociate from lysosomes. Lysosome damage is known to activate the CASM (Conjugation of ATG8 to Single Membranes) pathway leading to lipidation and recruitment to lysosomes of mammalian ATG8 (mATG8) proteins. We find that this process drives the reassociation of BLTP3A with damaged lysosomes via an interaction of its LIR motif with mATG8 which coincides with a dissociation from the vesicles. Our findings reveal that BLTP3A is an effector of CASM, potentially as part of a mechanism to help repair or minimize lysosome damage.

**Abstract:**
Kinetochores link chromosomes to dynamic microtubules of the mitotic spindle. To ensure equal chromosome segregation, sister chromatids must achieve biorientation. The conserved kinase Aurora B phosphorylates outer kinetochore proteins on attachments lacking tension, allowing re-establishment of new connections until biorientation is achieved. Aurora B localizes to the centromere as part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), but the underlying recruitment pathways can be eliminated without disrupting biorientation. It therefore remains unclear how the kinase operates during error correction. Here, we identify the conserved Spc105/Kre28 complex as an outer kinetochore receptor of the Aurora kinase Ipl1 and its activator Sli15 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that mutations in the helix bundle domain of Spc105/Kre28 impair mitotic error correction, resembling the effects of ipl1 or sli15 mutants. The defects can be suppressed by artificial recruitment of Ipl1. In biochemical experiments Ipl1/Sli15 directly associates with Spc105/Kre28, and a conserved segment in the Sli15 central domain is crucially involved in the binding mechanism. These results have important implications for the mechanism of tension-dependent error correction during chromosome biorientation.

**Abstract:**
We here describe that obesity and weight loss in male mice cause reversible abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism, serum metabolomes and lipidomes as well as expression of microRNAs, mRNAs and proteins controlling mitochondrial function in epididymal white adipose tissue. When mating obese male mice with lean females, we observed reductions in expression and translation of genes encoding mitochondrial respiratory compotents in (F1) offspring that closely resemble those observed in the paternal (F0) generation. When mapping miRNA regulation across somatic organs (i.e., liver, adipose) and sperm and F0/1 generations, we found that obesity and weight loss reversibly affected miRNA levels, and that let-7 isoforms were induced in obese F0 and F1 adipose tissue and sperm of obese F0 mice, eliciting qualitatively similar responses in two adjacent tissues. Overexpressing let-7 in adipocytes silenced DICER1, a miRNA processing enzyme crucial for adipose adaptation to obesity as evidenced by deficiencies in mitochondrial function following DICER1 loss in primary adipocytes. Also, microinjection of synthetic let-7 mimetics at physiological levels found in obese sperm into zygotes from lean mice elicited glucose intolerance and impediments in adipose mitochondrial gene expression in mice sired from let-7 microinjected zygotes, phenocopying hereditary aspects of paternal obesity. When performing single-cell RNA-Seq of miRNA-injected embryos, let-7 impaired mitochondrial gene expression, suggesting altered oxidative metabolism following zygotic let-7 delivery. When studying miRNA alterations in human semen, lifestyle-induced weight loss downregulated hsa-let-7, suggesting similar roles for human let-7 in gametic epigenomes and embryogenesis.

## Perinatal Elimination of Genetically Aberrant Neurons from Human Cerebral Cortex

**Abstract:**
Human neurons are postmitotic and long-lived, requiring precise genomic regulation to maintain function over a lifetime. Normal neuronal function is highly dependent on gene dosage, with copy number variants (CNV) and heterozygous point mutations associated with a host of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. Here, we investigated the landscape of somatic CNV arising in fetal human brains, and how they change over development, to understand the processes that generate neurons with low rates of aneuploidy. We identified 7,725 CNVs in >1,200 single neurons from human postmortem brain of 16 neurotypical individuals, ranging in age from gestational week 14 to 90 years old using Tn5-transposase-based single-cell whole-genome amplification. We surveyed CNVs in another 44,861 nuclei with 10X Multiome analysis. Up to 45% of postmitotic neurons in the prenatal cortex showed aberrant genomes, characterized by widespread CNVs of multiple chromosomes, but this reduces sharply after birth (p<0.01). We identified micronuclei in the developing cortex in situ, reflecting chromosomal material missegregated during neurodevelopment. The size of CNV appeared to define the trajectory of neuronal elimination, since cells with widespread CNVs were eliminated earlier and faster than cells with smaller CNVs. CNVs in surviving neurons were depleted for genes that are dosage-sensitive or involved in neurodevelopmental disorders (p<0.05), suggesting selective elimination of neurons with CNV involving these critical genes. Neurons with high CNV burdens also showed abnormal expression of synaptic gene sets, indicating that abnormal synaptic gene regulation may contribute to neuronal elimination. Elimination of defective neuronal genomes during synaptogenesis may represent a critical processes of genome quality control and a vulnerable target of factors that contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.

## Dinucleotide preferences underlie apparent codon preference reversals in the Drosophila melanogaster lineage

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
We employ fine-scale population genetic analyses to reveal dynamics among interacting forces that act at synonymous sites and introns among closely related Drosophila species. Synonymous codon usage bias has proven to be well-suited for population genetic inference. Under major codon preference, translationally superior "major" codons confer fitness benefits relative to their less efficiently and/or accurately decoded synonymous counterparts. Our codon family and lineage-specific analyses expand on previous findings in the Drosophila simulans lineage; patterns in naturally occurring polymorphism demonstrate fixation biases toward GC-ending codons that are consistent in direction, but heterogeneous in magnitude, among synonymous families. These forces are generally stronger than fixation biases in intron sequences. In contrast, population genetic analyses reveal unexpected evidence of codon preference reversals in the Drosophila melanogaster lineage. Codon family-specific polymorphism patterns support reduced efficacy of natural selection in most synonymous families but indicate reversals of favored states in the four codon families encoded by NAY. Accelerated synonymous fixations in favor of NAT and greater differences for both allele frequencies and fixation rates among X-linked, relative to autosomal, loci bolster support for fitness effect reversals. The specificity of preference reversals to codons whose cognate tRNAs undergo wobble position queuosine modification is intriguing. However, our analyses reveal prevalent dinucleotide preferences for ApT over ApC that act in opposition to GC favoring forces in both coding and intron regions. We present evidence that changes in the relative efficacy of translational selection and dinucleotide preference underlie apparent codon preference reversals.

## Uniaxial force modifies the length of the mammary ductal network and the orientation of ducts during pubertal development: Findings from computational modeling and laboratory experiments

**Abstract:**
The orientation of the epithelium ducts determines the overall shape of the ductal network in the mammary gland, which in turn impacts the efficiency of the delivery of milk through the ducts to breastfeeding infants. However, how the orientations of the ducts are specified is not well understood. Cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions perturb the tissue mechanical environment and influence mechanical signaling, which in turn regulates cell migration, tissue organization, and morphogenesis. This study examined if an applied force that perturbs the tissue mechanical environment can regulate the orientation of the epithelium ducts during puberty, in vivo. Uniaxial forces were applied continuously to the right abdominal number four mouse mammary glands (n=10; TEN) at 5-7 weeks of age, that is, during pubertal formation of the epithelial ductal network. The uniaxial force was applied by pulling and adhering the skin around the nipple of the right abdominal number four mammary gland. This pulling force on the right gland made the left abdominal number four gland also experience a contralateral (CONTRA) force. Mammary glands from litter mates were dissected at 3 weeks, 5 weeks, and 7 weeks of un-manipulated mice to serve as controls. Following dissection, whole mounts were prepared by carmine alum staining and panoramic images were captured under light microscopy. The ductal network in the images were skeletonized and straighten along the longitudinal midline to accurately capture the length of the ductal network without bias from its curvature. Findings from using the Measure tool in ImageJ version 1.54j indicated that the length of the ductal network was increased in the TEN and CONTRA mammary glands compared to control (p<0.05). Analysis of the images using OrientationJ version 16.01.2018, an ImageJ plug-in, indicated that the orientation of ducts in the TEN and CONTRA mammary glands where altered compared to control (p<0.05). Although the ductal network was longer in the TEN and CONTRA glands compared to control, there was no significant difference in the total cross-sectional area. In-silico simulations of the ductal network formation using a branching and annihilating random walk model predicted that the increased length of the ductal network may have resulted from changes in the orientation of the epithelium ducts. Thus it is likely that mechanical forces regulate the orientation of ductal branches in vivo.

**Abstract:**
Arabidopsis thaliana zygotes form a circumferential cortical microtubule (CMT) band that moves upward along the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical cell; however, how and why this CMT band moves remain unknown. Based on several recently proposed descriptive feedback mechanisms of CMT reorientation, we hypothesized that a directional cue (DC) changes CMT orientation. We constructed an agent-based simulation model with a DC to observe what happens during CMT formation using different parameters. We determined that the output CMT band can become larger than the input DC zone and identified two types of self-organization processes depending on the parameters used. Furthermore, using well-defined parameters that form a static CMT band, we artificially changed the position of the input DC zone, revealing that CMT band movement requires a DC to move at an appropriate speed.

**Abstract:**
Systemic inflammation can lead to neuroinflammation with acute consequences such as delirium and long-lasting deleterious effects including cognitive decline and the exacerbation of neurodegenerative disease progression. Here we show that the activation status of the transcription factor Nrf2 in endothelial cells is a critical regulator of this process. We found that peripheral inflammation caused infiltration of macrophages, microglial activation and inflammatory reactive astrogliosis, all of which could be prevented by RTA-404, an activator of the transcription factor Nrf2 and close structural relative of the recently FDA-approved Nrf2 activator RTA-408 (Omaveloxolone). To identify the key cellular mediator(s), we generated an endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 knockout mouse. Strikingly, the effects of RTA-404 on brain endothelial activation and downstream neuroinflammatory events was abolished by endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 deletion. This places endothelial cell Nrf2 as a peripherally accessible therapeutic target to reduce the CNS-adverse consequences of systemic inflammation.

**Abstract:**
Pregnancy- and birth-related factors affect offspring brain development, emphasizing the importance of early life exposures. While most previous studies have focused on a few variables in isolation, here we investigated associations between a broad range of pregnancy- and birth-related variables and multivariate cortical brain MRI features. Our sample consisted of 8,396 children aged 8.9 to 11.1 years from the ABCD Study. Through multiple correspondence analysis and factor analysis of mixed data, we distilled numerous pregnancy and birth variables into four overarching dimensions; maternal pregnancy complications, maternal substance use, low birth weight and prematurity, and newborn birth complications. Vertex-wise measures of cortical thickness, surface area, and curvature were fused using linked independent component analysis. Linear mixed effects models showed that maternal pregnancy complications and low birth weight and prematurity were associated with smaller global surface area. Additionally, low birth weight and prematurity was associated with complex regional cortical patterns reflecting bidirectional variations in both surface area and cortical thickness. Newborn birth complications showed multivariate patterns reflecting smaller occipital- and larger temporal area, bi-directional frontal area variations, and reduced cortical thickness across the cortex. Maternal substance use showed no associations with child cortical structure. By employing a multifactorial and multivariate morphometric fusion approach, we connected complications during pregnancy and fetal size and prematurity to global surface area and specific regional signatures across child cortical MRI features.

Significance StatementEarly life stages, including pregnancy and birth circumstances, are critically important for a wide range of real-life outcomes for the child. In this study, we linked maternal complications during pregnancy and low birth weight and prematurity to globally reduced cortical surface area, and low birth weight and prematurity, in addition to pregnancy and birth complications, to complex cortical structural patterns later in late childhood. Our findings underscore the importance of providing support to mothers and children during these crucial phases, helping to ensure optimal conditions for healthy child development.

**Abstract:**
Global biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, with agriculture as one of the major drivers. There is mounting evidence that intercropping can increase insect biodiversity while maintaining or increasing yield. Yet, intercropping is often considered impractical for mechanized farming systems. Strip cropping is a type of intercropping that is compatible with standard farm machinery and has been pioneered by Dutch farmers since 2014. Here, we present ground beetle data from four organically managed experimental farms across four years. Ground beetles are sensitive to changes in habitats and disturbances, and hold keystone positions in agroecosystem food webs. We show that strip cropping systems can enhance ground beetle biodiversity, while previous research shows that these increases have been achieved without incurring major yield loss. Strip cropped fields had on average 15% more ground beetle species and 30% more individuals than monocultural fields. The higher ground beetle richness in strip crops was explained by the merger of crop-related ground beetle communities, rather than by ground beetle species unique to strip cropping systems. The increase in field-level beetle species richness in organic agriculture through strip cropping approached increases found for other readily deployed biodiversity conservation methods, like shifting from conventional to organic agriculture (+19% - +23%). This indicates that strip cropping is a potentially useful tool supporting ground beetle biodiversity in agricultural fields without compromising food production.

**Abstract:**
Synthetic biology offers the promise of manufacturing chemicals more sustainably than petrochemistry. Yet, both the rate at which biomanufacturing can synthesize these molecules and the net chemical accessible space are limited by existing pathway discovery methods which can often rely on arduous literature searches. Here, we present an automated retrobiosynthesis tool, BioPKS Pipeline, that simultaneously tackles both problems by integrating multifunctional type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) with monofunctional enzymes to propose the synthesis of desired target chemicals via two new tools: DORAnet and RetroTide. While monofunctional enzymes are valuable for carefully decorating a substrate's carbon backbone, they typically cannot expand the backbone itself. PKSs can, instead, predictably do this through their unique ability to catalyze carbon-carbon bond formation reactions iteratively. We have evaluated the performance of BioPKS Pipeline against a previously published set of 155 molecules of interest for biomanufacturing, and report that BioPKS Pipeline could produce exact designs for 93 of them, as well as pipelines to a chemically similar product for most of the remaining molecules. Furthermore, BioPKS Pipeline successfully proposes biosynthetic routes for complex therapeutic natural products (cryptofolione and basidalin) for which no known biosynthetic pathway currently exists.

## A microenvironment-driven, HLA-II-associated insulin neoantigen elicits persistent memory T cell activation in diabetes

**Abstract:**
The evolving antigenic landscape of autoimmune diabetes reflects a dynamic failure to preserve self-tolerance. Yet, how novel neoantigens emerge in humans remains incompletely understood. Here, we designed an immunopeptidomics-based approach to probe HLA-II-bound, islet-derived neoepitopes in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We uncovered a microenvironment-driven cysteine-to-serine transformation, conserved between mice and humans, that reshapes autoreactivity to insulin, the core {beta}-cell antigen, at the single-residue level. This transformation, which we call 'C19S,' arises from oxidative remodeling of insulin in stressed pancreatic islets and can also occur in inflammatory antigen-presenting cells, contributing to a feed-forward loop of neoepitope formation and presentation as diabetes progresses. Despite involving only a single amino acid, C19S is specifically recognized by HLA-DQ8-restricted, register-specific CD4+ T cells that expand in individuals with T1D. These C19S-specific CD4+ T cells lack regulatory potential but acquire a poised central memory phenotype that persists at different disease stages. These findings reveal a distinct, microenvironment-driven route of neoantigen formation that fuels sustained autoreactivity in diabetes.

**Abstract:**
Letter processing plays a key role in visual word recognition. However, word recognition models typically overlook or greatly simplify early perceptual processes of letter recognition. We suggest that optimal transport theory may provide a computational framework for describing letter shape processing. We use representational similarity analysis to show that optimal transport cost (Wasserstein distance) between pairs of letters aligns with neural activity elicited by visually presented letters <225 ms after stimulus onset, outperforming an existing approach based on shape overlap. We additionally show that optimal transport can capture the emergence of geometric invariances (e.g., to position or size) observed in letter perception. Finally, we demonstrate that Wasserstein distance predicts neural activity similarly well to features from artificial networks trained to classify images and letters. However, whereas representations in artificial neural networks emerge in a computationally unconstrained manner, our proposal provides a computationally explicit route to modeling the earliest orthographic processes.

## Coming up short: generative network models fail to accurately capture long-range connectivity

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-04

**Abstract:**
Generative network models (GNMs) have been proposed to identify the mechanisms/constraints that shape the organisation of the connectome. These models parameterise the formation of inter-regional connections using a trade-off between connection cost and topological complexity or biophysical similarity. Despite their simplicity, GNMs can generate synthetic networks that capture many topological properties of empirical brain networks. However, current models often fail to capture the topography (i.e., spatial embedding) of many such properties, such as the anatomical location of network hubs. In this study, we investigate a diverse array of generative network model formulations and find that none can accurately capture empirical patterns of long-range connectivity. We demonstrate that the spatial embedding of longer-range connections is critical in defining hub locations and that it is precisely these connections that are poorly captured by extant models. We further show how standard measures used for model optimisation and evaluation mask these and other differences between synthetic and empirical brain networks, highlighting the need for care when interpreting generative network models and metrics. Overall, our findings demonstrate common failure modes of GNMs, identify why these models do not fully capture brain network organisation, and suggest ways the field can move forward to address these challenges.

## Actomyosin forces trigger a conformational change in desmoplakin within desmosomes.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
Desmosomes are essential cell-cell adhesion organelles that enable tension-prone tissue, like the skin and heart, to withstand mechanical stress. Desmosomal anomalies are associated with numerous epidermal disorders and cardiomyopathies. Despite their critical role in maintaining tissue resilience, an understanding of how desmosomes sense and respond to mechanical stimuli is lacking. Here, we use a combination of super-resolution imaging, FRET-based tension sensors, atomistic computer simulations, and biochemical assays to demonstrate that actomyosin forces induce a conformational change in desmoplakin, a critical cytoplasmic desmosomal protein. We show that in human breast cancer MCF7 cells, actomyosin contractility reorients keratin intermediate filaments and directs force to desmoplakin along the keratin filament backbone. These forces induce a conformational change in the N-terminal plakin domain of desmoplakin, converting this domain from a folded (closed) to an extended (open) conformation. Our findings establish that desmoplakin is mechanosensitive and responds to changes in cellular load by undergoing a force-induced conformational change.

## Trikafta rescues F508del-CFTR by tightening specific phosphorylation-dependent interdomain interactions

**Abstract:**
Trikafta is well-known for correcting thermal and gating defects caused by the most common cystic fibrosis mutation F508del in the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator even at a physiological temperature. However, the exact correction pathway is still unclear. Here, noncovalent interactions among two transmembrane domains (TMD1 and TMD2), the regulatory (R) domain and two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) were analyzed. The thermal stability of NBD1 was also evaluated through its tertiary constrained noncovalent interaction networks or thermoring structures. The results demonstrated that Trikafta binding to flexible TMD1 and TMD2 rearranged their interactions with the R domain upon phosphorylation, coupling tightened cytoplasmic TMD1-TMD2 interactions to tightened Mg/ATP-dependent NBD1-NBD2 dimerization, which stabilized NBD1 above human body temperature. Overall, although the deletion of F508 induces the primary thermal defect in NBD1 and then the gating defect at the TMD1-TMD2 interface, Trikafta rescued them in a reverse manner allosterically. These mechanistic insights into the precise correction pathway of this misfolded channel facilitate optimizing cystic fibrosis treatment.

## Inferring global exponents in subsampled neural systems

**Abstract:**
In systems displaying an activity charaterized by avalanches, critical exponents may give informations on the mechanisms underlying the observed behaviour or on the topology of the connections. However, when only a small fraction of the units composing the system are observed and sampled, the measured exponents may differ significantly from the true ones. In this study, using Branching Process and (2+1)D Directed Percolation we show that some of the exponents, namely the ones governing the power spectrum and the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of the system activity, are more robust and are unaffected in some intervals of frequencies by the subsampling. This robustness derives from the preservation of long-time correlations in the subsampled signal, even though large avalanches can be fragmented into smaller ones. These results dont depend on the specific model and may be used therefore to extract in a simple and unbiased way some of the exponents of the unobserved full system.

## Molecular Crowding Suppresses Mechanical Stress-Driven DNA Strand Separation

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
Molecular crowding influences DNA mechanics and DNA - protein interactions and is ubiquitous in living cells. Quantifying the effects of molecular crowding on DNA supercoiling is essential to relating in-vitro experiments to in-vivo DNA supercoiling. We use single molecule magnetic tweezers to study DNA supercoiling in the presence of dehydrating or crowding co-solutes. To study DNA supercoiling, we apply a stretching force of 0.8 pN to the DNA and then rotate one end of the DNA to induce supercoiling. In a 200 mM NaCl buffer without co-solutes, negatively supercoiled DNA absorbs some of the tortional stress by forming locally melted DNA regions. The base-pairs in these locally melted regions are believed to adopt a configuration where nucleotide base pairing is disrupted. We find that the presence of a dehydrating co-solute like glycerol further destabilizes base-pairs in negatively supercoiled DNA. The presence of polyethylene glycol, commonly used as a crowding agent, suppresses local strand separation and results in plectoneme formation even when DNA is negatively supercoiled. The results presented in this letter suggest further directions for studies of DNA supercoiling and supercoiled DNA - protein interactions in molecular conditions that approximate in-vivo molecular composition.

SIGNIFICANCEAccurate modelling of DNA mechanics is central to interpreting results of single molecule studies of DNA mechanics and DNA-protein interactions. While the effect of molecular conditions on thermal stability of short and relaxed DNA has been studied, the influence of molecular conditions on DNA supercoiling has not been explored. We present the first single molecule study of DNA supercoiling in the presence of crowding and dehydrating co-solutes. We observe that co-solutes can increase or completely suppress mechanical stress-driven base-pair disruption in negatively supercoiled DNA. This change of DNA supercoiling is likely to significantly affect the function of DNA-binding proteins. Our results motivate the need for systematic exploration of DNA supercoiling in presence of co-solutes to accurately relate in-vitro DNA-protein interactions to in-vivo DNA-protein interactions.

## Differential roles of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 in neocortical pyramidal cell excitability

**Abstract:**
Mature neocortical pyramidal cells functionally express two sodium channel (NaV) isoforms: NaV1.2 and NaV1.6. These isoforms are differentially localized to pyramidal cell compartments, and as such are thought to contribute to different aspects of neuronal excitability. But determining their precise roles in pyramidal cell excitability has been hampered by a lack of tools that allow for selective, acute block of each isoform individually. Here, we leveraged aryl sulfonamide-based molecule (ASC) inhibitors of NaV channels that exhibit state-dependent block of both NaV1.2 and NaV1.6, along with knock-in mice with changes in NaV1.2 or NaV1.6 structure that prevents ASC binding. This allowed for acute, potent, and reversible block of individual isoforms that permitted dissection of the unique contributions of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 in pyramidal cell excitability. Remarkably, block of each isoform had contrasting--and in some situations, opposing--effects on neuronal action potential output, with NaV1.6 block decreasing and NaV1.2 block increasing output. Thus, NaV isoforms have unique roles in regulating different aspects of pyramidal cell excitability, and our work may help guide development of therapeutics designed to temper hyperexcitability through selective NaV isoform blockade.

**Abstract:**
The ovarian hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, have vaso- and neuroprotective effects, likely due to interactions with the cerebrovascular system. This study investigates their neuroendocrine influence on a range of cerebral and retinal vascular functions across a healthy menstrual cycle. Twenty-six healthy, menstruating females completed imaging sessions and assessment of circulating hormone levels during their early follicular, late follicular, and mid-luteal phase (1-4, 10-12 and 20-22 days after menses onset). Cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterial arrival time (AAT), global oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), cerebrovascular metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), carotid artery radius and carotid pulsatility index (PI) were measured using 3T MRI. Retinal vessel density and blood flow resistance were assessed with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). Assessed with linear models, increased oestradiol was related to increased global CBF ({chi}2(1)=41.682; p=1.074x10-10). An independent progesterone increase was also associated with increased global CBF ({chi}2(1)=14.979; p=0.0001). In the retina, a relationship was found between oestradiol and decreased retinal blood flow resistance ({chi}2(1)=5.28; p=0.0215), which was primarily driven by centrally localised vessels. This study finds that circulating oestrogen increases blood flow in the eye and brain, while progesterone significantly impacts the brain alone. These effects suggest a potential pathway for neuroprotective mechanisms.

## Quantifying acyl chain interdigitation in simulated bilayers via direct transbilayer interactions

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
In a lipid bilayer, the interactions between lipid hydrocarbon chains from opposing leaflets can influence membrane properties. These interactions include the phenomenon of interdigitation, in which an acyl chain of one leaflet extends past the bilayer midplane and into the opposing leaflet. While static interdigitation is well understood in gel phase bilayers from X-ray diffraction measurements, much less is known about dynamic interdigitation in fluid phases. In this regard, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations can provide mechanistic information on interleaflet interactions that can be used to generate experimentally testable hypotheses. To address limitations of existing computational methodologies which provide results that are either indirect or averaged over time and space, here we introduce three novel ways of quantifying the extent of chain interdigitation. Our protocols include the analysis of instantaneous interactions at the level of individual carbon atoms, thus providing temporal and spatial resolution for a more nuanced picture of dynamic interdigitation. We compare the methods on bilayers composed of lipids with equal total number of carbon atoms but different mismatches between the sn-1 and sn-2 chain lengths. We find that these metrics, which are based on freely available software packages and are easy to implement, provide complementary details that help characterize various features of lipid-lipid contacts at the bilayer midplane. The new frameworks thus allow for a deeper look at fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying bilayer structure and dynamics, and present a valuable expansion of the membrane biophysics toolkit.

**Abstract:**
A growing body of evidence supports the idea that RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) activity during transcription elongation can be regulated to control transcription rates. Using genomic run-on and RNAP II chromatin immunoprecipitation, we measured both active and total RNAP II across the bodies of genes at three different stages of the mitotic cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: G1, S, and G2/M. Comparison of active and total RNAP II levels at these stages revealed distinct patterns of transcription elongation control throughout the cell cycle. Previously characterized cycling genes were associated with some of these elongation patterns. A cluster of genes with highly divergent genomic run-on and RNAP II chromatin immunoprecipitation patterns was notably enriched in genes related to ribosome biogenesis and the structural components of the ribosome. We confirmed that the expression of ribosome biogenesis mRNAs increases after G1 but decreases following mitosis. Finally, we analyzed the contribution of mRNA stability to each cluster and found that a coordinated regulation of RNAP II activity and mRNA decay is necessary to fully understand the alternative strategies of gene expression across the cell cycle.

## Nucleus accumbens dopamine encodes the trace period during appetitive Pavlovian conditioning

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
Pavlovian conditioning tasks have been used to identify the neural systems involved with learning cue-outcome relationships. In delay conditioning, the presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS) overlaps or co-terminates with the delivery of the unconditioned stimulus (US). Prior studies demonstrate that behavioral responding during delay conditioning is regulated by dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In particular, the dopamine response to the CS reflects the relative value of the upcoming reward in these tasks. In contrast to delay conditioning, trace conditioning involves a trace period that separates the end of the CS and the delivery of the US. While dopamine has been implicated in trace conditioning, no studies to date have examined how NAc dopamine responds to reward-related stimuli in these tasks. To address this, we developed a within-subject trace conditioning task where distinct audio CSs signaled either a short trace period (5s) or a long trace period (55s) prior to the delivery of a food reward. Male rats exhibited higher levels of conditioned responding and a faster latency to respond to the Short Trace CS relative to the Long Trace CS. Voltammetry recordings in the NAc found that dopamine levels to the CS increased on Short Trace trials but decreased on Long Trace trials. Conversely, US-evoked dopamine responses were greater on Long Trace trials relative to Short Trace trials. We found that the CS dopamine response correlated with the latency to respond and not to the level of conditioned responding. Furthermore, the relationship between CS dopamine and latency was best explained by an exponential function. Taken together, our results illustrate how CS-evoked dopamine signals in the NAc relate to behavioral outcomes. Furthermore, we find that trace period is encoded by the bidirectional NAc dopamine response to the CS during Pavlovian conditioning.

## Compensatory evolution following deleterious episodes of GC-biased gene conversion in rodents

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-04

**Abstract:**
GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a widespread evolutionary force associated with meiotic recombination that favours the accumulation of deleterious AT to GC substitutions in proteins, moving them away from their fitness optimum. In many mammals recombination hotspots have a rapid turnover, leading to episodic gBGC, with the accumulation of deleterious mutations stopping when the recombination hotspot dies. Selection is therefore expected to act to repair the damage caused by gBGC episodes through compensatory evolution. However, this process has never been studied or quantified so far. Here, we analysed the nucleotide substitution pattern in coding sequences of a highly diversified group of Murinae rodents. Using phylogenetic analyses of about 70,000 coding exons, we identified numerous exon-specific, lineage-specific gBGC episodes, characterised by a clustering of synonymous AT to GC substitutions and by an increasing rate of non-synonymous AT to GC substitutions, many of which are potentially deleterious. Analysing the molecular evolution of the affected exons in downstream lineages, we found evidence for pervasive compensatory evolution after deleterious gBGC episodes. Compensation appears to occur rapidly after the end of the episode, and to be driven by the standing genetic variation rather than new mutations. Our results demonstrate the impact of gBGC on the evolution of amino-acid sequences, and underline the key role of epistasis in protein adaptation. This study contributes to a growing body of literature emphasizing that adaptive mutations, which arise in response to environmental changes, are just one subset of beneficial mutations, alongside mutations resulting from oscillations around the fitness optimum.

## Transferring functional chromosomes between intergeneric yeast generates monochromosomal hybrids with improved phenotypes and widespread transcriptional responses

**Abstract:**
Interspecific hybrids can exhibit phenotypes that surpass those of their parents, known as heterosis, which is often of interest for industrial applications and evolutionary genetics research. However, constructing hybrids between distantly related species, such as intergeneric yeasts, presents technical challenges. In this study, we established a method to transfer individual chromosomes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) into Kluyveromyces marxianus (Km), an emerging model for bioproduction. The Sc chromosome of interest was circularized, genetically modified to carry Km centromeres and replication origins, and transformed into Km via protoplast transformation. With this method, we generated monochromosomal hybrids with eight Km chromosomes and Sc chromosome I or III. The Sc chromosomes exhibited normal replication, segregation, and active transcription in the hybrids. The hybrids displayed heterosis in flocculation and salt tolerance due to the overexpression of FLO9 and SPS22 on transferred Sc chromosome, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that both cis- and trans-regulatory changes contributed to the divergence of gene expression between the two species, with the cis and trans effects often acting in a compensatory manner. Our strategy has potential applications in optimizing cell factories, constructing synthetic genomes, and advancing evolutionary research.

**Abstract:**
Assessment of pharmacological intervention on in vitro neural systems often emphasizes molecular and structural changes. However, neural systems fundamentally process and act on information. For preclinical assays to predict drug efficacy, they must model these physiological functions. DishBrain, an in vitro assay embodying a neural system in a simulated game-world, enables quantification of information-processing capacity and dose-response profiling. Hyperactive glutamatergic dysregulation is linked to many neurological disorders. Inducible overexpression of neurogenin 2 (NGN2) in hiPSCs generated glutamatergic cultures with dysregulated hyperactivity. Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) were trialed on this model within a game-world using closed-loop electrophysiological stimulation and recordings. MEA data from day 21 of differentiation revealed significant electrophysiological development. Treatments included dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), phenytoin, perampanel, or carbamazepine. Carbamazepine 200 M significantly reduced firing rates and improved gameplay metrics, such as hit/miss ratio and rally length. This marks the first demonstration of altered synthetic biological intelligence (SBI) in a neural model after drug treatment. Notably, only inhibitory compounds enhanced goal-directed activity, linking glutamatergic attenuation to performance. Neurocomputational analysis revealed nuanced pharmacological responses during closed-loop stimulation, highlighting insights beyond spontaneous activity metrics.

**Abstract:**
The level of cellular organization bridging the mesoscale and whole-cell scale is coming into focus as a new frontier in cell biology. Great progress has been made in unraveling the complex physical and functional interconnectivity of organelles, but how the entire organelle network is spatially arranged within the cytoplasm is only beginning to be explored. Drawing on cross-disciplinary research synthesis methods, we systematically curated the whole-cell volumetric imaging literature, resulting in a corpus consisting of 89 studies and 118 image datasets. We describe the trajectory and current state of the field between 2004 and 2024. A broad characterization, or 'scoping review', of bibliometrics, study design, and reporting practices shows accelerating technological development and research output. We find high variability in study design and reporting practices, including imaging modality, model organism, cellular contexts, organelles imaged, and analyses. Due to the laborious, low-throughput nature of most volumetric imaging methods, we find trends toward small sample sizes (<10 cells) and small cell types. We describe common quantitative analyses across studies, including volumetric ratios of organelles and inter-organelle contact analyses. This work establishes the initial iteration of a growing dataset of whole-cell imaging literature and data, and motivates a call for standardized whole-cell imaging study design, reporting, and data sharing practices in the context of an emerging sub-field of cell biology. Our curated dataset now provides the basis for a plethora of future aggregate and comparative analyses to reveal larger patterns and generalized hypotheses about the systems behavior and regulation of whole-cell organelle networks. More broadly, we showcase the potential of new rigorous secondary research methods to strengthen cell biology's literature review and reproducibility toolkit, create new avenues for discovery, and promote open research practices that support secondary data-reuse and integration.

## Human differentiated adipocytes can serve as surrogate mature adipocytes for adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicle analysis

**Abstract:**
Obesity is a growing global health concern, contributing to diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions. Adipose tissue dysfunction, characterized by abnormal adipokine secretion and chronic inflammation, plays a key role in these conditions. Adipose-derived extracellular vesicles (ADEVs) have emerged as critical mediators in obesity-related diseases. However, the study of mature adipocyte-derived EVs (mAdipo-EVs) is limited due to the short lifespan of mature adipocytes in culture, low EV yields, and the low abundance of these EV subpopulations in the circulation. Additionally, most studies rely on rodent models, which have differences in adipose tissue biology compared to humans. To overcome these challenges, we developed a standardized approach for differentiating human preadipocytes (preAdipos) into mature differentiated adipocytes (difAdipos), which produce high-yield, human adipocyte EVs (Adipo-EVs). Using visceral adipose tissue from bariatric surgical patients, we isolated the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and differentiated preAdipos into difAdipos. Brightfield microscopy revealed that difAdipos exhibited morphological characteristics comparable to mature adipocytes (mAdipos) directly isolated from visceral adipose tissue, confirming their structural similarity. Additionally, qPCR analysis demonstrated decreased preadipocyte markers and increased mature adipocyte markers, further validating successful differentiation. Functionally, difAdipos exhibited lipolytic activity comparable to mAdipos, supporting their functional resemblance to native adipocytes. We then isolated preAdipo-EVs and difAdipo-EVs using tangential flow filtration and characterized them using bulk and single EV analysis. DifAdipo-EVs displayed classical EV and adipocyte-specific markers, with significant differences in biomarker expression compared to preAdipo-EVs. These findings demonstrate that difAdipos serve as a reliable surrogate for mature adipocytes, offering a consistent and scalable source of adipocyte-derived EVs for studying obesity and its associated disorders.

**Abstract:**
Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) is one of the most commonly used media supplement for the maintenance of mammalian cell types, yet the expensive costs, ethical concerns, and lot-to-lot variation have provoked a clear need for a serum that is standardized and derived from non-animal sources. Several serum-free formulations have been developed in the past, however they are often cell type specific, contain animal-derived components, and lack long-term culture validation. In this study, we developed a novel animal component-free (ACF) media and investigated its effectiveness on four commonly used mammalian cell lines via long-term (up to 90 days) morphological, transcriptomic, and proliferative analyses. Cells cultured in our ACF medium exhibited comparable cellular morphologies and equal or greater growth rates compared with cells cultured with FBS. Additionally, differentially expressed genes between the FBS-grown and ACF-grown groups were predominantly associated with functions linked to proliferation and cell attachment. The findings from this study indicate that this medium is a suitable replacement to FBS-containing medium for several common cell lines.

**Abstract:**
In the textbook view, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) act as coincidence detectors in Hebbian plasticity by fluxing Ca2+ when simultaneously depolarized and glutamate bound. Hebbian coincidence detection requires that NMDARs be located postsynaptically, but enigmatic presynaptic NMDARs (preNMDARs) also exist. It is known that preNMDARs regulate neurotransmitter release, but precisely how remains poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggest that NMDARs can also signal non-ionotropically, without the need for Ca2+ flux. At synapses between developing visual cortex layer-5 (L5) pyramidal cells (PCs), preNMDARs rely on Mg2+ and Rab3-interacting molecule 1{beta} (RIM1{beta}) to regulate evoked release during periods of high-frequency firing, but they signal non-ionotropically via c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) to regulate spontaneous release regardless of frequency. At the same synapses, timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) depends on preNMDARs but not on frequency. We therefore tested if tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling. We found that tLTD at L5 PC[-&gt;]PC synapses was abolished by pre- but not postsynaptic NMDAR deletion, cementing the view that tLTD requires preNMDARs. In agreement with non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling, tLTD prevailed after channel pore blockade with MK-801, unlike tLTP. Homozygous RIM1{beta} deletion did not affect tLTD, but wash-in of the JNK2 blocker SP600125 abolished tLTD. Consistent with a presynaptic need for JNK2, a peptide blocking the interaction between JNK2 and Syntaxin-1a (STX1a) abolished tLTD if loaded pre- but not postsynaptically, regardless of frequency. Finally, low-frequency tLTD was not blocked by the channel pore blocker MK-801, nor by 7-CK, a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist at the co-agonist site. We conclude that neocortical L5 PC[-&gt;]PC tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling via JNK2/STX1a. Our study brings closure to long-standing controversy surrounding preNMDARs and highlights how the textbook view of NMDARs as ionotropic coincidence detectors in plasticity needs to be reassessed.

**Abstract:**
Plasmodium falciparum Pfs230 and Pfs48/45, part of a core fertilization complex, are leading malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates. However, how the two proteins interact is unknown. Here we report a 3.36 [A] resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the endogenous Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex. We show that Pfs48/45 interacts with Pfs230 domains 13 and 14, domains that are not included in current Pfs230 vaccine immunogens. Using a transgenic parasite line with a domain 13 to 14 deletion, we show that these domains are essential for Pfs230 localization on the gamete surface. Furthermore, this line significantly reduced oocyst formation in the mosquito midgut, showing that the presence of Pfs230 domains 13 and 14 is critical for successful fertilization. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibit Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation, reduce transmission and structural analyses reveal their binding epitopes. Furthermore, domains 13 and 14 are targets of naturally acquired immunity and when delivered as mRNA-LNP immunizations induce potent immune responses and blocked transmission of malaria parasites. Our comprehensive structural insights on a core P. falciparum fertilization complex will guide the design of novel transmission-blocking vaccine candidates against malaria.

**Abstract:**
DNA and RNA nucleotide sequences are ubiquitous in all biological cells and serve as a comprehensive library of capabilities for the cells and as an impressive regulatory system to control cellular function. The presented multi-alignment framework (MAF) provides researchers with a user-friendly sequence alignment platform as a functional template that is flexible enough to adjust all steps but also comprehensive enough to join many different tools and custom parameter combinations if in-depth analysis is necessary or advised, like in low read rate situations. The framework enables researchers to apply multiple aligners and further processing tools in flexible combinations to analyze the subtle to pronounced differences between different alignment programs and algorithms applied to the same data basis. This flexibility supports sophisticated research concepts and enables the discovery of robust and relevant biological results. MAF is based on Linux the major platform in Bioinformatics. If the Bash script language and Linux knowledge is not a hurdle development time could be saved by the user with the provided materials like the Bash script templates and the detailed installation information for the tools. The script structure enables the integration of all the processing steps and saves time if procedures need to be redone a lot of times with different parameter combinations or many different data sets. Because of the script base every user can modify the given templates to its own needs. The exemplary and comprehensive microRNA analysis exemplifies the value of looking into the details of alignment and quantification procedures and therefore gives insight into how the quality of the result candidates can be assessed and presumably false positives excluded. The three provided templates offer a structure to combine in a flexible way pre- and post processing steps, and are inherently extendable and completely redesignable to support many sequence analysis scenarios. So this approach is suitable for scientists which really want to look down to the basics of their alignment results and expect to be flexible in every respect of their results. The microRNA template shows a complex real world application backed by three publications.

## Hyperreflexia after corticospinal tract lesion reflects 1A afferent circuit changes not increased KCC2 hyperexcitability

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-05

**Abstract:**
Hyperreflexia is a consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI) and motor system lesions in the brain Two major mechanisms underpinning hyperreflexia have been reported: proprioceptive afferent (PA) circuit changes produced by 1A fiber sprouting, which could enhance reflex signaling, together with reduced GABAergic inhibitory presynaptic regulation (GABApre); and increased intrinsic motor neuron excitability, for example, produced by reduced motor neuron membrane-bound potassium-chloride co-transporter2 (KCC2). Here we examine how selective unilateral CST injury in the medullary pyramid (PTX), which eliminates the CST from one hemisphere, allows for specific investigation of the different mechanisms to determine their contributions to hyperreflexia. We used rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the Hoffmann (H)-reflex for the forelimb and hindlimb 5th-digit abductor muscles to assess hyperreflexia on both the contra- and ipsilesional sides. We compared RDD in naive and unilateral-PTX rats at 7-dpi and 42-dpi, supplemented with additional timepoints to examine hyperreflexia development. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify PA synapses (VGlut1), GABA presynaptic boutons (GABApre), motor neurons (ChAT), and to measure KCC2. Following unilateral PTX, we observed significant hyperreflexia in the contralesional forelimb only. Membrane-bound KCC2 was unchanged in contralesional cervical motor neurons. Whereas both cervical and lumbar motor neurons showed increased PA sprouting contralesionally, there was a concomitant increase in GABApre terminals for the lumbar not cervical cord, which associated with a normal hindlimb H-reflex. Our findings show that KCC2 is disassociated from hyperreflexia in the uniPTX model. Instead, forelimb hyperreflexia can be explained by cervical motor neuron PA sprouting and an uncompensated GABApre regulation.

**Abstract:**
Biotechnological advances in CO2 utilization through gas fermentation offer a sustainable alternative to energy-intensive chemical processes. This study investigates and optimizes fermentation dynamics of Clostridium carboxidivorans sp. 624 for enhanced production of C2-C6 acids via combined experimental and computational methods. A systematic experimental evaluation of temperature and medium conditions, along with time-course analysis elucidates metabolic pathway regulation. Experimental optimisation, complemented by modelling, identified gas-liquid volumetric ratios VL/VG = 4 as optimal for maximizing longer-chain acids production, attributed to enhanced gas solubility and substrate bioavailability. Additionally, a hybrid model combining dynamic-kinetic model and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) successfully predict product formation. By capturing spatial inhomogeneities in gas-liquid interactions, the model also provides critical insights for optimizing fermentation performance and establishes a framework for improving process design parameters for CO2/H2 fermentation, paving the way for scalable and efficient CO2-based bioprocesses.

## The flexible contribution of cortical area V4 to visual perception

**URL:** https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.11.642616
**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
Cortical area V4 is thought to be critical for visual object recognition. It contains millimeter-scale domains in which neurons are highly selective for stimulus features such as shape, motion, and color. In theory, many different stimuli can be decoded from neural activity in each of these domains, but whether the brain actually makes use of this information is unknown. Here we have tested this hypothesis, using reversible inactivation of V4 in non-human primates performing a shape discrimination task. We find that training with the stimuli preferred by a particular domain causes the brain to develop a simple readout that ignores much of the information in the V4 neural population. In contrast, training with other stimuli leads to a more distributed readout of the V4 population. Thus, specialized cortical domains do not necessarily have a fixed behavioral function, but they can powerfully influence the learning of new perceptual tasks.

**Abstract:**
1In vitro viability assays are widely used in drug discovery, development, and pharmacovigilance. Traditional methods for evaluating cell viability often involve destructive processes, rendering the culture non-viable. As such, these methods are suitable only as endpoint solutions, providing a single measurement per cell culture and precluding further analyses of the cells. In this study, we introduce Neural Viability Regression (NViR), a real-time, deep learning-based method that enables non-invasive quantification of culture viability using microscopy images. The non-intrusive nature of NViR allows for frequent viability evaluations throughout experiments, capturing subtle changes while maintaining the structural integrity of the culture and significantly reducing both culture and labor costs. We demonstrate NViRs applicability by using it to predict Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) in known drugs. By exposing human liver spheroids to 108 FDA-approved drugs and capturing microscopy images over time, NViRs viability assessments accurately predict whether a drug induces DILI in humans, playing a critical role in enhancing liver safety protocols. The cost-effectiveness and non-invasive characteristics of NViR enable high-frequency, high-throughput viability assessments. Consequently, NViR is poised to reduce both the costs and incidences of failures in drug discovery and development.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
The WEE1 kinase negatively regulates CDK1/2 to control DNA replication and mitotic entry. Genetic factors that determine sensitivity to WEE1 inhibitors (WEE1i) are largely unknown. A genome-wide insertional mutagenesis screen revealed that mutation of EIF2A, a translation regulator, sensitized to WEE1i. Mechanistically, WEE1i treatment triggers a translational shut-down, which is lethal in combination with the reduced translation of EIF2AKO cells. A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen revealed that inactivation of integrated stress response (ISR) kinases GCN1/2 rescued WEE1i-mediated cytotoxicity. WEE1i induced GCN2 activation, ATF4 upregulation, and altered ribosome dynamics. Loss of the collided ribosome sensor ZNF598 conversely increased sensitivity to WEE1i. Notably, the ISR was not required for WEE1i to induce DNA damage, premature mitotic entry or sensitization to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics. ISR activation was independent of CDK1/2 activation. Importantly, WEE1i-mediated ISR activation was independent of WEE1 presence, pointing at off-target effects, which are shared by multiple chemically distinct WEE1i. This response was also observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Importantly, low-dose WEE1 inhibition did not induce ISR activation, while it still synergized with PKMYT1 inhibition. Taken together, WEE1i triggers toxic ISR activation and translational shutdown, which can be prevented by low-dose or combination treatments, while retaining the cell cycle checkpoint-perturbing effects.

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) have actively been utilised by various RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) protocols and technologies to remove polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicates, thus enhancing counting accuracy. However, errors during sequencing processes often compromise the precision of UMI-assisted quantification. To overcome this, various computational methods have been proposed for UMI error correction. Despite these advancements, the absence of a unified benchmarking and validation framework for UMI deduplication methods hinders the systematic evaluation and optimisation of these methods. Here, we present UMIche, an open-source, UMI-centric computational platform designed to improve molecular quantification by providing a systematic, integrative, and extensible framework for UMI analysis. Additionally, it supports the development of more effective UMI deduplication strategies. We show that through its integration of a broad spectrum of UMI deduplication methods and computational workflows, UMIche significantly advances the accuracy of molecular quantification and facilitates the generation of high-fidelity gene expression profiles.

**Abstract:**
Molecular quantification in high-throughput sequencing experiments relies on accurate identification and removal of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicates. The use of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) in sequencing protocols has become a standard approach for distinguishing molecular identities. However, PCR artefacts and sequencing errors in UMIs present a significant challenge for effective UMI collapsing and accurate molecular counting. Current computational strategies for UMI collapsing often exhibit limited flexibility, providing invariable deduplicated counts that inadequately adapt to varying experimental conditions. To address these limitations, we developed mclUMI, a tool employing the Markov clustering algorithm to accurately identify original UMIs and eliminate PCR duplicates. Unlike conventional methods, mclUMI automates the detection of independent communities within UMI graphs by dynamically fine-tuning inflation and expansion parameters, enabling context-dependent merging of UMIs based on their connectivity patterns. Through in silico experiments, we demonstrate that mclUMI generates dynamically adaptable deduplication outcomes tailored to diverse experimental scenarios, particularly best-performing under high sequencing error rates. By integrating connectivity-driven clustering, mclUMI enhances the accuracy of molecular counting in noisy sequencing environments, addressing the rigidity of current UMI deduplication frameworks.

**Abstract:**
The rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies has spurred the development of numerous computational tools designed to identify gene expression patterns from growing datasets at both bulk and single-cell sequencing levels. The recent advent of longread sequencing technologies has further accelerated the availability and refinement of these tools. The lack of ground-truth labels and annotations in sequencing data presents a significant challenge for evaluating the efficacy of analytical tools. To address this, we developed Tresor, an integrated platform for simulating both short and long reads at bulk and single-cell levels. We devised a tree-based algorithm to significantly accelerate in silico experiments at high PCR cycles. Tresor allows for customising sequencing libraries with highly modular and flexible read structures, facilitating the verification of sequencing-related biological discoveries. This tool also includes features that introduce substitution, insertion, and deletion errors at various stages of library preparation, PCR amplification, and sequencing, enhancing its applicability in diverse experimental conditions and simulating real world conditions. Our results demonstrate that, upon removal of PCR duplicates, cell type-specific gene expression profiles derived from our simulated reads highly resemble reference data. We envisage that Tresor will provide valuable insights into a broader range of transcriptomics analyses and support the development of more effective algorithms for read alignment and UMI deduplication.

**Abstract:**
We propose a learning architecture that allows symbolic control and guidance
in reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. We introduce SymDQN, a
novel modular approach that augments the existing Dueling Deep Q-Networks
(DuelDQN) architecture with modules based on the neuro-symbolic framework of
Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs). The modules guide action policy learning and
allow reinforcement learning agents to display behaviour consistent with
reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed
on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a
5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated
with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal
behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape
recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly
improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent.
The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities
of combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.

## ESAT-6 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis downregulates cofilin1, leads to filamentous actin enrichment and reduces the phagosome acidification in infected macrophages, which are partially reversed by a single methionine mutation

**Abstract:**
Mycobacterium tuberculosis when phagocytosed by macrophages is not cleared completely and many of the bacteria remain in phagosomes indefinitely. In this study we considered abnormal retention of filamentous actin on early phagosomes contributing to defective phagosome acidification. The actin depolymerizing protein cofilin1 was found downregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Also, phosphocofilin1, the inactive form of cofilin1, which leads to retention of filamentous actin, and the total filamentous actin itself were found upregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Over expression of constitutively active cofilin1 in macrophages was found to decrease the level of filamentous actin and increase phagosome acidification when infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. The anticancer drug sorafenib which activates cofilin1 in PI3K dependent manner was also found to decrease the filamentous actin level and increase phagosome acidification. Cofilin1, known to be positively regulated by superoxide was found to be downregulated by ESAT-6 of M. tuberculosis where the latter is known to reduce ROS in macrophages. Ectopic expression of ESAT-6 in macrophages was found to downregulate cofilin1, increase filamentous actin and to transform the macrophages more spindle shaped. ESAT-6 was also found to decrease phagosome acidification in macrophages infected with an avirulent M. tuberculosis strain. Finally, this study proposes a role for the amino acid methionine in resisting ROS by creating M93 mutants of ESAT-6.

**Abstract:**
Many diverse bacteria can enter non- or slow-growing states where they are transiently tolerant to antibiotics. Despite its medical importance, the genetic mechanisms underlying this 'persistence' remain largely unknown, especially for spontaneous (type II) persistence that arise during exponential growth in rich medium. To address this challenge, here we combine genomic, transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis to identify the persistence mechanisms. We first analyzed the genome of the high-persistence mutant Escherichia coli DS1 (hipQ) to identify candidate genes for the high persistence phenotype. We then compared the gene expression profile of spontaneous persisters to normally growing cells with RNAseq and find that the activation of stress response mechanisms is likely not very important in the entrance into hipQ-driven spontaneous persistence. Transcriptomic results also suggest that modifications in the cell membrane play an important role, as further corroborated by lipidomic profiles showing a higher level of unsaturated fatty acids in spontaneous persisters compared to induced persisters or normally growing cells. Taken together, our results indicate that changing membrane composition is a key process in persistence, and further our understanding of spontaneous persister cells from the DS1 (hipQ) context.

## The Self-Interest of Adolescents Overrules Cooperation in Social Dilemmas

**Abstract:**
Cooperation is essential for success in society. Research consistently showed that adolescents are less cooperative than adults, which is often attributed to underdeveloped mentalizing that limits their expectations of others. However, the internal computations underlying this reduced cooperation remain largely unexplored. This study compared cooperation between adolescents and adults using a repeated Prisoners Dilemma Game. Adolescents cooperated less than adults, particularly after their partners cooperation. Computational modeling revealed that adults increased their intrinsic reward for reciprocating when their partner continued cooperating, a pattern absent in adolescents. Both computational modeling and self-reported ratings showed that adolescents did not differ from adults in building expectations of their partners cooperation. Therefore, the reduced cooperation appears driven by a lower intrinsic reward for reciprocity, reflecting a stronger motive to prioritize self-interest, rather than a deficiency in mentalizing or social learning. These findings provide insights into the developmental trajectory of cooperation from adolescence to adulthood.

## Identifying the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic correlation between complex human traits using a gene-based approach

**Abstract:**
Phenotypic correlations between complex human traits have long been observed based on epidemiological studies. However, the genetic basis and underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we developed a gene-based approach to measure genetic overlap between a pair of traits and to delineate the shared genes/pathways, through three steps: 1) translating SNP-phenotype association profile to gene-phenotype association profile by integrating GWAS with eQTL data using a newly developed algorithm called Sherlock-II; 2) measuring the genetic overlap between a pair of traits by a normalized distance and the associated p value between the two gene-phenotype association profiles; 3) delineating genes/pathways involved. Application of this approach to a set of GWAS data covering 59 human traits detected significant overlap between many known and unexpected pairs of traits; a significant fraction of them are not detectable by SNP based genetic similarity measures. Examples include Cancer and Alzheimers Disease (AD), Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohns disease, and Longevity and Fasting glucose. Functional analysis revealed specific genes/pathways shared by these pairs. For example, Cancer and AD are co-associated with genes involved in hypoxia response and P53/apoptosis pathways, suggesting specific mechanisms underlying the inverse correlation between them. Our approach can detect yet unknown relationships between complex traits and generate mechanistic hypotheses and has the potential to improve diagnosis and treatment by transferring knowledge from one disease to another.

## Music-selective cortex is sensitive to structure in both pitch and time

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-02

**Abstract:**
Music is distinguished from other natural sounds by the presence of relatively discrete notes, which are then organized across pitch and time to convey melody, harmony, and rhythm. Growing evidence suggests that small clusters of neural populations within anterior and posterior human non-primary auditory cortex respond selectively to musical structure. However, it is unclear whether this selectivity reflects short-term musical structure at the level of individual notes, and/or the patterning of notes in pitch and time. We used fMRI voxel decomposition to measure the response of music-selective and non-selective auditory neural populations to synthetic music and drum stimuli whose notes were scrambled in pitch and/or time, disrupting musical pattern structure while largely preserving note-level structure. We observed reliably stronger responses to music with intact pitch and temporal pattern structure in both anterior and posterior music-selective regions bilaterally, but little difference between intact and scrambled music in non-selective populations. Further, only music-selective populations showed reliably stronger responses to note-scrambled music compared with non-music sounds. These results suggest that musical structure involving both individual notes and their patterning over time is specifically represented in localized music-selective neural populations of human non-primary auditory cortex.

**Abstract:**
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling of host-pathogen interactions has enhanced our understanding of drug resistance. However, how combinations of drug resistance mutations impact dose-response curves remains underappreciated in PK-PD studies. The fitness seascape model addresses this by extending the fitness landscape model to map genotypes to dose-response functions, enabling the study of evolution under fluctuating drug concentrations. Here, we present an empirical fitness seascape in E. coli harboring all combinations of four drug resistance mutations. Incorporating these data into PK-PD simulations of antibiotic treatment, we find that higher mutation supply increases the probability of resistance, and early adherence to the drug regimen is critical. In vitro studies further support the finding that the second dose in a drug regimen is important for preventing resistance. This work represents the first application of an empirical fitness seascape in computational PK-PD studies, revealing novel insights into drug resistance.

**Abstract:**
Classical genes within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are responsible for peptide presentation to T cells, thus playing a central role in immune defense against pathogens. These genes are subject to strong selective pressures including both balancing and directional selection, resulting in exceptional genetic diversity--thousands of alleles per gene in humans. Moreover, some allelic lineages appear to be shared between primate species, a phenomenon known as trans-species polymorphism (TSP) or incomplete lineage sorting, which is rare in the genome overall. However, despite the clinical and evolutionary importance of MHC diversity, we currently lack a full picture of primate MHC evolution. In particular, we do not know to what extent genes and allelic lineages are retained across speciation events. To start addressing this gap, we explore variation across genes and species in our companion paper (Fortier and Pritchard, 2025) and here we explore variation within individual genes. We used Bayesian phylogenetic methods to determine the extent of TSP at 17 MHC genes, including classical and non-classical Class I and Class II genes. We find strong support for ancient TSP in 7 of 10 classical genes, including--remarkably--between humans and old-world monkeys in MHC-DQB1. In addition to the long-term persistence of ancient lineages, we additionally observe rapid evolution at nucleotides encoding the proteins' peptide-binding domains. The most rapidly-evolving amino acid positions are extremely enriched for autoimmune and infectious disease associations. Together, these results suggest complex selective forces--arising from differential peptide binding--that drive short-term allelic turnover within lineages while also maintaining deeply divergent lineages for at least 31 million years in some cases.

**Abstract:**
Sensorimotor computations for learning and behavior rely on precise patterns of synaptic connectivity. Yet, we typically lack the synaptic wiring diagrams for long-range connections between sensory and motor circuits in the brain. Here we provide the synaptic wiring diagram for sensorimotor circuits involved in learning and production of male zebra finch song, a natural and ethologically relevant behavior. We examined the functional synaptic connectivity from the 4 main sensory afferent pathways onto the 3 known classes of projection neurons of the song premotor cortical region HVC. Recordings from hundreds of identified projection neurons reveal rules for monosynaptic connectivity and the existence of polysynaptic ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in HVC. Circuit tracing further identifies novel connections between HVCs presynaptic partners. Our results indicate a modular organization of ensemble-like networks for integrating long-range input with local circuits, providing important context for information flow and computations for learned vocal behavior.

**Abstract:**
The immediate social context critically modulates drug consumption. The presence of an unfamiliar conspecific, naive to the drug, at the time of consumption reduces cocaine self-administration in male rats during short-access sessions, as well as drug intake in human cocaine users. The subthalamic nucleus (STN), a brain structure involved in cocaine addiction and limbic processes, has been proposed to mediate such social influence on this limited level of drug intake. Whether this influence extends to escalated drug consumption remains an open question. In this study, we compared the effect of the presence of an unfamiliar peer, naive to cocaine, on cocaine self-administration in rats having been exposed to either short (2h) or long-access sessions (6h). We showed that the presence of the peer drastically reduced both limited and escalated cocaine intake in males, while it had no effect on females during short-access sessions. Assessing the effect of STN photo-inhibition or high frequency (HF) stimulation in male rats, we demonstrated that it had no effect in the absence of the conspecific in short-access sessions, STN photo-manipulation suppressed the influence of the peer presence. Moreover, STN photo-inhibition and HF stimulation decreased drug consumption in long-access sessions, but no additive effect was observed when associated with the peer presence, confirming an overriding effect of STN manipulation. Taken together, these results highlight the potential influence of socially oriented manipulations on cocaine intake and further position the STN as a critical mediator of the effect of social presence on addictive-like behaviors.

**Abstract:**
Building on the known scaling law that a single timescale, a cellular unit of time, governs stochastic growth and division of individual bacterial cells under constant growth conditions, here we propose that a dynamic rescaling of the cellular unit of time serves to capture the dominant effect of changing conditions on the cell age distribution. This temporal scaling ansatz provides a natural representation for these time-dependent dynamics in whose terms the cell age distribution evolves under time-invariant rules! Finally, we discuss relevance of these results to recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells growing and dividing in dynamic environments.

**Abstract:**
Lemurs are often cited as an example of adaptive radiation. Since colonizing Madagascar, more than 100 extant lemur species have evolved to fill a variety of ecological niches on the island. However, recent work suggests that lemurs do not exhibit one of the hallmarks of other adaptive radiations: explosive speciation rates that decline over time. Thus, characterizing the tempo and mode of evolution in lemurs can help us understand alternative ways that hyperdiverse clades arise over time, which might differ from traditional models. We explore the evolution of lemurs using a phylogenomic dataset with broad taxonomic sampling that includes the lemurs sister group, the lorisiforms of Asia and continental Africa. Our analyses reveal multiple bursts of diversification (without subsequent declines) that explain much of todays lemur diversity. We also find higher rates of speciation in Madagascars lemurs compared to lorisiforms, and we demonstrate that the lemur clades with exceptionally high diversification rates have higher rates of genomic introgression. This suggests that hybridization in these primates is not an evolutionary dead-end, but a driving force for diversification. Considering the conservation crisis affecting strepsirrhine primates, with approximately 95% of species being threatened with extinction, this phylogenomic study offers a new perspective for explaining Madagascars exceptional primate diversity and reveals patterns of speciation, extinction, and gene flow that will help inform future conservation decisions.

**Abstract:**
The genome, which serves as the inherent language directing the blueprint of life, offers significant analysis prospects by combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Integrating biological sequences with other digital healthcare information has potential to transform data-driven diagnostics. Large language models (LLMs) can be harnessed to decode the genomic language. This endeavor encounters three critical challenges: First, long biomolecular sequences require segmentation into smaller subunits, which is non-trivial since many biological "words" remain unknown. Second, the analysis of extended DNA sequences using LLMs demands a compute-intensive infrastructure. Third, ensuring reproducibility and reusability of modeling workflows remains an unresolved issue. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an empirical DNA tokenisation approach and a versatile, semantic-aware, genome language model genomicBERT. The model is species-agnostic and operates seamlessly at the DNA or RNA levels. By introducing a reduced and specialized DNA vocabulary, our approach minimizes computational overhead and optimizes performance. Our benchmarking demonstrates that the genomicBERT matches or surpasses the performance of contemporary tools on the same datasets under different experimental conditions. To encourage collaboration and ease of access, we introduce genomicBERT as an integral component of the openly accessible conda package, genomeNLP. Validated across diverse case studies, genomicBERT lowers the barriers to decoding genomic language, relying solely on sequence data to extract meaningful insights.

## Enhanced 5mC-Methylation-Site Recognition in DNA Sequences using Token Classification and a Domain-specific Loss Function

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-04

**Abstract:**
DNA 5-methylcytosine modification has been widely studied in mammals and plays an important role in epigenetics. Several computational methods exist that attempt to determine the methylation state of a DNA sequence centered at a possible methylation site. Here, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework, MR-DNA, that predicts the methylation state of a single nucleotide located in a gene promoter region. The idea is to adapt the named-entity recognition approach to methylation-site prediction and to incorporate biological rules during model construction. MR-DNA has a stacked model architecture consisting of a pre-trained MuLan-Methyl-DistilBERT language model and a conditional random field algorithm, trained with a self-defined methyl loss function. The resulting fine-tuned model achieves an accuracy of 97.9% on an independent test dataset of samples. An advantage of this formulation of the methylation-site identification task is that it predicts on every nucleotide of a sequence of a given length, unlike previous methods that the predict methylation state of DNA sequences of a short fixed length. For training and testing purposes, we provide a database of DNA sequences containing verified 5mC-methylation sites, calculated from data for eight human cell lines downloaded from the ENCODE database.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundReduced affective empathy is a hallmark of psychopathy, which incurs major interpersonal and societal costs. Advancing our neuroscientific understanding of this reduction and other psychopathic traits is crucial for improving their treatment.

MethodsIn 804 incarcerated adult men, we administered the Perspective Taking (IRI-PT) and Empathic Concern (IRI-EC) subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R; two factors), and T1-weighted MRI to quantify cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA). We also included the male sample of the Human Connectome Project (HCP; N = 501) to replicate patterns of macroscale structural organization.

ResultsFactor 1 (Interpersonal/Affective) uniquely negatively related to IRI-EC, while Factor 2 (Lifestyle/Antisocial) uniquely negatively related to IRI-PT. Cortical structure did not relate to either IRI subscale, although there was effect-size differentiation by microstructural class and/or functional network. CT related to Factor 1 (mostly positively), SA related to both factors (only positively), and both cortical indices demonstrated out-of-sample predictive utility for Factor 1. The high-psychopathy group (N = 178) scored uniquely lower on IRI-EC while having increased SA (but not CT). Regionally, these SA increases localized primarily in the paralimbic class and somatomotor network, with meta-analytic task-based activations corroborating affective-sensory importance. High psychopathy also showed "compressed" global and/or network-level organization of both cortical indices, and this organization in the total sample replicated in HCP. All findings accounted for age, IQ, and/or total intracranial volume.

ConclusionsPsychopathy had negative relationships with affective empathy and positive relationships with paralimbic/somatomotor SA, highlighting the role of affect and sensation.

**Abstract:**
Objective To integrate macro-transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing to analyze the differential gene expression between primary and brain metastatic breast cancer cells, as well as between active and dormant cancer cells within brain metastases, exploring their adaptation and remodeling abilities at different stages of brain metastasis. Methods Four public datasets were used: three mRNA microarray datasets from breast cancer and brain metastasis tissues, and one single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from active and dormant brain metastatic cells. Gene differential expression, pathway enrichment, and cell clustering analyses were performed to compare primary and metastatic breast cancer cells, as well as active and dormant cells in brain metastases, focusing on gene expression, metabolic pathways, and functional pathways. Results Metastatic breast cancer cells showed weakened pathways related to the extracellular matrix and protein digestion. Active cells exhibited enhanced cell cycle regulation, tumor proliferation, and hypoxia resistance pathways compared to dormant cells. Clustering analysis revealed that cluster 6, unique to dormant cells, had enhanced functions in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen formation, tumor inflammation siganure (TIS), and IL-10 signaling. Cluster 3 and 4 in active cells had enhanced DNA replication and tumor proliferation pathways, respectively. Conclusion This study highlights the role of cancer cell characteristics and heterogeneity in the invasiveness of brain metastasis. Understanding these mechanisms can guide the development of more effective treatment strategies for breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) patients.

**Abstract:**
Biological function is mediated by the hierarchical organization of cell types and states within tissue ecosystems. Identifying interpretable composite marker sets that both define and distinguish hierarchical cell identities is essential for decoding biological complexity, yet remains a major challenge. Here, we present RECOMBINE, an algorithm that identifies recurrent composite marker sets to define hierarchical cell identities. Validation using both simulated and biological datasets demonstrates that RECOMBINE achieves higher accuracy in identifying discriminative markers compared to existing approaches, including differential gene expression analysis. When applied to single-cell data and validated with spatial transcriptomics data from the mouse visual cortex, RECOMBINE identified key cell type markers and generated a robust gene panel for targeted spatial profiling. It also uncovered markers of CD8+ T cell states, including GZMK+HAVCR2- effector memory cells associated with anti-PD-1 therapy response, and revealed a rare intestinal subpopulation with composite markers in mice. Finally, using data from the Tabula Sapiens project, RECOMBINE identified composite marker sets across a broad range of human tissues. Together, these results highlight RECOMBINE as a robust, data-driven framework for optimized marker selection, enabling the discovery and validation of hierarchical cell identities across diverse tissue contexts.

## Mu and delta opioid receptor antagonists increase the expression of social conditioned place preference in early adolescent mice

**Abstract:**
RationaleSocial behaviors undergo dramatic changes during adolescence, enabling the development of adult social abilities. These changes are intricately linked to the development of the brain reward system and the activity of endogenous opioid signaling. However, the involvement of the opioid system in the development of social behaviors still raises more questions than answers.

ObjectivesHere, we investigated the role of the endogenous opioid system in the rewarding effects of social contact in early and late adolescent male mice.

MethodsSocial reward was assessed using the social conditioned place preference task in early adolescent (~34 days old) and late adolescent (~41 days old) male mice that received a single dose of the selective opioid receptor antagonists cyprodime (1 mg/kg, i.p.), naltrindole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or norbinaltorphimine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) before the preference posttest.

ResultsThe administration of cyprodime or naltrindole before the posttest significantly increased the preference for the social-conditioned context in early but not late adolescent mice. In contrast, pretreatment with norbinaltorphimine had no effect on context preference.

ConclusionsOur findings support a modified version of the state-dependent mu-opioid receptor model of social behavior, where the effects of opioid ligands are not reversed during development but rather weaken or disappear with age. Furthermore, the results indicate that interactions with siblings in early adolescent mice are motivated by negative reinforcement, whereas those in late adolescence are motivated by positive reinforcement.

**Abstract:**
The dopaminergic system has been extensively studied for its role in behavior in animals as well as human neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases. However, we still know little about how dopamine levels are tightly regulated in vivo. To identify novel regulators of dopamine, we utilized Drosophila melanogaster cuticle pigmentation as a readout, where dopamine is a precursor to melanin. We measured dopamine from genes known to be critical for cuticle pigmentation and performed an RNAi-based screen to identify new regulators of pigmentation. We found 153 potential pigmentation genes, which were enriched for conserved homologs and disease- associated genes as well as developmental signaling pathways and mitochondria-associated proteins. From 35 prioritized candidates, we found 10 caused significant reduction in head dopamine levels and one caused an increase. Two genes, clueless and mask (multiple ankyrin repeats single KH domain), upon knockdown, reduced dopamine levels in the brain. Further examination suggests that Mask regulates the transcription of the rate-limiting dopamine synthesis enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase, and its knockdown causes dopamine-dependent sleep phenotypes. In summary, by studying genes that affect cuticle pigmentation, a phenotype seemingly unrelated to the nervous system, we were able to identify several genes that affect dopamine metabolism as well as a novel regulator of behavior.

## Growth directions and stiffness across cell layers determine whether tissues stay smooth or buckle

**Abstract:**
From smooth shapes to buckles, nature exhibits organs of various shapes and forms. How cells grow to produce smooth shaped leaves and sepals remain unclear. Here, we show that growth along the longitudinal axis during early developmental stages and comparable stiffness across both epidermal layers of Arabidopsis sepals are essential for smoothness, as seen in the wild type. We identified a mutant (as2-7D) with ectopic expression of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) on the outer epidermis. Our analysis reveals that ectopic AS2 expression causes the outer epidermis of as2-7D sepals to buckle during early stages of sepal development. We show that buckling of the outer epidermis occurs due to conflicting cell growth directions and unequal tissue stiffness across the epidermal layers. Overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor Kip-related protein 1 (KRP1) in as2-7D restores sepal smoothness by aligning the growth directions of the outer epidermal cells along the longitudinal axis, while also increasing the overall stiffness of the outer epidermis. Furthermore, buckling is associated with the convergence of auxin efflux transporter protein PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) to generate outgrowth in the sepals at later stages, suggesting that buckling can initiate outgrowths. Our findings suggest that in addition to molecular cues influencing tissue mechanics, tissue mechanics can also modulate molecular signals, giving rise to well-defined shapes.

One-Sentence SummaryThe asymmetric leaves 2-7D mutant sepals buckle due to discoordination of growth between the two epidermal layers.

**Abstract:**
The circadian clock attunes metabolism to daily energy cycles, but how it regulates maturation of metabolic tissues is poorly understood. Here we show that DEC1, a clock transcription factor induced in adult islet {beta} cells, coordinates their glucose responsiveness by synchronizing energetic and secretory rhythms. DEC1 binds and regulates maturity-linked genes to integrate insulin exocytosis with energy metabolism, and {beta}-cell Dec1 ablation disrupts their transcription synchrony. Dec1-disrupted mice develop lifelong glucose intolerance and insulin deficiency, despite normal islet formation and intact Clock/Bmal1 genes. Metabolic dysfunction upon {beta}-cell Dec1 loss stems from poor coupling of insulin secretion to glucose metabolism, reminiscent of fetal/neonatal immaturity. We link stunted maturation to a deficit in circadian bioenergetics, prompted by compromised glucose utilization, mitochondrial dynamics, and respiratory metabolism, which is rescued by increased metabolic flux. Thus, DEC1 links circadian clockwork to {beta}-cell metabolic maturation, revealing a hierarchy for how the clock programs metabolic tissue specialization.

**Abstract:**
Glioblastoma is the deadliest brain cancer, characterized by large cellular diversity whose complexity and organizing principles are only starting to be uncovered. Both neurodevelopment-like and mesenchymal-like cell states have been described in glioblastoma1-8, with the latter being strongly implicated in malignancy and disease progression8-11. However, the nature of these mesenchymal-like cell states remains unresolved. Here, we performed deep single-cell RNA sequencing of rare glioblastoma cases where tissue could be sampled from tumor core to macroscopically normal cortex. We discovered that previously defined mesenchymal-like tumor cell states instead represented a wound response that was shared across both malignant and non-malignant cell types and was spatially confined to the tumor bulk. Using glioblastoma organoids, we showed that the wound response transcriptional state could be reversibly induced in vitro by hypoxia and human plasma. We used multiplex single-molecule spatial transcriptomics12 on a large patient cohort to show that the activation of wound response states was associated with hypoxia, and organized by distance to perivascular niches. Our findings help reconceptualize the cellular landscape of glioblastoma, wherein a reactive wound-response tissue state shared by all cells in the tumor bulk is superimposed on a fundamentally neurodevelopmental and glial tumor.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundGene annotation enrichment analysis is the gold standard for studying the biological context of a set of genes, but available tools often overlook important network properties of the underlying gene regulatory system.

ResultsWe present the NETwork ANnotation enrichment package, NetAn, built in Python, which augments annotation analysis with approaches such as inference of closely related genes to include local neighbors in the analysis, the extraction of separate network sub-clusters, and the following over-representation analyses based on network clustering. By using NetAn, we demonstrate how these approaches enhance the identification of relevant annotations in human gene sets. In a specific case study on Multiple Sclerosis (MS), NetAns approach of incorporating neighboring genes through network-based expansion demonstrates a distinct advantage in identifying immune-related genes critical to MS pathology. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of NetAn to stratify MS annotations to also identify relevant neuron-related enrichments. Lastly, we compare NetAn to alternative network-based approaches, and find it to have greater specificity compared to broader approaches like NET-GE.

ConclusionsWe present NetAn, a novel network-based approach that can stratify annotation enrichment analyses by integrating gene interactions and network topology, thereby strengthening biological signals through the inclusion of associated genes. This approach allows for enhanced identification of disease-relevant annotations, as demonstrated in the MS case study.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundSexual selection theory is a multifaceted area of evolutionary research that has profound implications across various disciplines, including population genetics, evolutionary ecology, animal behavior, sociology, and psychology. It explores the mechanisms by which certain traits and behaviors evolve due to mate choice and competition within a species. In the context of this theory, the Jeffreys divergence measure, also known as population stability index, plays a key role in quantifying the information obtained when a deviation from random mating occurs for both discrete and continuous data. Despite the critical importance of understanding mating patterns in the context of sexual selection, there is currently no software available that can perform model selection and multimodel inference with quantitative mating data to test hypotheses about the dynamics underlying observed mating patterns. Recognizing this gap, I have developed QInfoMating which provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing and interpreting mating data within the framework of sexual selection theory.

ResultsThe program QInfoMating incorporates a user-friendly interface for performing statistical tests, best-fit model selection, and parameter estimation using multimodel inference for both discrete and continuous mating data. A use case is presented with real data of the species Echinolittorina malaccana.

ConclusionsThe application of information theory, model selection, and parameter estimation using multimodel inference are presented as powerful tools for the analysis of mating data, whether quantitative or categorical. The QInfoMating program is a tool designed to perform this type of analysis.

**Abstract:**
Individuals with Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB), a rare genetic skin disease characterised by loss of function mutations in the Laminin332 (Lam332), do not survive beyond their first birthday. Here we report that loss of Lam332 leads to absence of cholesterol lipid from the epidermis in vitro and in vivo. Using 3D skin equivalents, a JEB mouse model and JEB patient samples we confirmed changes in epidermal lipid synthesis, which was further explored using lipidomics. Cholesterol biosynthesis genes were increased with loss of Laminin-332 in vitro, however a decrease in immunofluorescence lipid staining was observed. Cholesterol transport in Laminin-332 knockdown keratinocytes was revealed to be disrupted, which in keratinocytes is dependent on the actomyosin network. In conclusion these findings suggest a role for the basement membrane protein Laminin-332 in lipid metabolism in the skin, and a broader role for epidermal homeostasis and barrier formation. Restoration of cholesterol transport in epidermal keratinocytes of JEB patients offers the potential to improve their skin barrier.

**Abstract:**
In the human brain, the alpha rhythm in occipital cortex and the mu rhythm in sensorimotor cortex are among the most prominent rhythms, with both rhythms functionally implicated in gating modality-specific information. Separation of these rhythms is non-trivial due to the spatial mixing of these oscillations in sensor space. Using a computationally efficient processing pipeline requiring no manual data cleaning, we isolated alpha and/or mu rhythms from electroencephalography recordings performed on 1605 children aged 5-18. Using the extracted time series for each rhythm, we characterized the waveform shape on a cycle-by-cycle basis and examined whether and how the waveform shape differs across development. We demonstrate that alpha and mu rhythms both exhibit nonsinusoidal waveform shape that changes significantly across development, in addition to the known large changes in oscillatory frequency. This dataset also provided an opportunity to assess oscillatory measures for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found no differences in the resting-state features of these alpha-band rhythms for either ADHD or ASD in comparison to typically developing participants in this dataset. While waveform shape is ignored by traditional Fourier spectral analyses, these nonsinusoidal properties may be informative for building more constrained generative models for different types of alpha-band rhythms, yielding more specific insight into their generation.

**Abstract:**
Homeostasis is a fundamental characteristic of living systems. Unlike rigidity, homeostasis necessitates that systems respond flexibly to diverse environments. Understanding the dynamics of biochemical systems when subjected to perturbations is essential for the development of a quantitative theory of homeostasis. In this study, we analyze the response of bacterial metabolism to externally imposed perturbations using kinetic models of Escherichia colis central carbon metabolism in nonlinear regimes. We found that three distinct kinetic models consistently display strong responses to perturbations; In the strong responses, minor initial discrepancies in metabolite concentrations from steady-state values amplify over time, resulting in significant deviations. This pronounced responsiveness is a characteristic feature of metabolic dynamics, especially since such strong responses are seldom seen in toy models of the metabolic network. Subsequent numerical studies show that adenyl cofactors consistently influence the responsiveness of the metabolic systems across models. Additionally, we examine the impact of network structure on metabolic dynamics, demonstrating that as the metabolic network becomes denser, the perturbation response diminishes--a trend observed commonly in the models. To confirm the significance of cofactors and network structure, we constructed a simplified metabolic network model, underscoring their importance. By identifying the structural determinants of responsiveness, our findings offer implications for bacterial physiology, the evolution of metabolic networks, and the design principles for robust artificial metabolism in synthetic biology and bioengineering.

**Abstract:**
Cortical activity results from the interplay between network-connected regions that integrate information and stimulus-driven processes originating from sensory motor networks responding to specific tasks. Separating the information due to each of these components has been challenging, and the relationship as measured by fMRI in each of these cases Rest (network) and Task (stimulus-driven) remains a significant outstanding question in the study of large-scale brain dynamics. In this study, we develop a network ordinary differential equation (ODE) model using advanced system identification tools to analyze fMRI data from both rest and task conditions. We demonstrate that task-specific ODEs are essentially a subset of rest-specific ODEs across four different tasks from the Human Connectome Project. By assuming that task activity is a relative complement of rest activity, our model significantly improves predictions of reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis, leading to a 9 % increase in explanatory power (R2) across the 14 subtasks tested. We have additionally shown that these results hold for predicting missing trials and accuracy on a per individual basis as well as classifying Tasks trajectories or resulting dynamic Task functional connectivity. Our findings establish the principle of the Active Cortex Model, which posits that the cortex is always active and that Rest State encompasses all processes, while certain subsets of processes get elevated to perform specific task computations. Thus, this study is an important milestone in the development of the fMRI equation - to causally link large-scale brain activity, brain structural connectivity, and behavioral variables within a single framework.

**Abstract:**
The ocean acts as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and resulting in substantial uptake of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. As biological processes in the oceans such as net primary production (NPP) contribute significantly to this sink, understanding how they will shift in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 is necessary to project future ocean carbon storage capacity. Macronutrient and micronutrient resource limitation within the oceans regulates NPP, and while some micronutrients such as zinc (Zn) are present at very low concentrations, their ability to limit NPP has remained unclear. Zn is a key micronutrient used by phytoplankton for a multitude of metabolic functions, yet there have been few observations of its influence on natural oceanic phytoplankton populations. In this study, we observed Zn limitation of growth in the natural phytoplankton community of Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, in addition to primary iron (Fe) limitation. Shipboard incubation experiments amended with Zn and Fe resulted in significantly higher chlorophyll a content and dissolved inorganic carbon drawdown compared to Fe addition alone. Zn and Fe stress response proteins detected in incubation and environmental biomass provided independent verification of algal co-stress for these micronutrients. We consider total biomass and low surface ocean pCO2 as potential drivers of environmental Zn stress. This study definitively establishes that Zn limitation can occur in the modern oceans, opening up new possibility space in our understanding of nutrient regulation of NPP through geologic time, and we consider the future of oceanic Zn limitation in the face of climate change.

**Abstract:**
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is typically treated empirically with vancomycin, with therapy later tailored based on susceptibility results. However, these tests occur before vancomycin exposure and do not account for adaptation during empiric treatment that can alter S. aureus' susceptibility to first-line drugs. To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU, impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes. Our findings suggest a probabilistic approach to antimicrobial therapy, advocating for rapid genomic diagnostics alongside susceptibility testing to better anticipate and respond to evolutionary changes.

**Abstract:**
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), predominantly derived from mitochondrial respiratory complexes, have emerged as key molecules influencing cell fate decisions like maintenance and differentiation. These redox-dependent events are mainly considered to be cell intrinsic in nature, on the contrary our observations indicate involvement of these oxygen-derived entities as intercellular communicating agents. In Drosophila male germline, Germline Stem Cells (GSCs) and neighbouring Cyst Stem Cells (CySCs) maintain differential redox thresholds where CySC have higher redox-state compared to the adjacent GSCs. Disruption of the redox equilibrium between the two adjoining stem cell populations by depleting Superoxide Dismutases (SODs) especially Sod1 results in deregulated niche architecture and loss of GSCs, which was mainly attributed to loss of contact-based receptions and uncontrolled CySC proliferation due to ROS-mediated activation of self-renewing signals. Our observations hint towards the crucial role of differential redox states where CySCs containing higher ROS function not only as a source of their own maintenance cues but also serve as non-autonomous redox moderators of GSCs. Our findings underscore the complexity of niche homeostasis and predicate the importance of intercellular redox communication in understanding stem cell microenvironments.

**Abstract:**
Statistical causal learning in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) relies on the instrumental variable method of Mendelian Randomization (MR). Currently, an overwhelming number of MR studies purport to show causal relationships among a wide range of risk factors and outcomes. Here, we find that naive application of many recently proposed MR approaches results in numerous null relationships being discovered as highly significant. We show that a well-controlled error rate can be achieved through a graphical inference approach which: (i) selects a set of genetic instrumental variables (IVs) from GWAS summary static controlling for LD, linkage and pleiotropy; (ii) accommodates rare variants and binary outcomes in a principled way; (iii) distinguishes direct from indirect risk factors in very high-dimensional data; and (iv) identifies potential unobserved latent confounding. Only 20 minutes of wall-clock compute time is required for our Causal Inference GWAS (CI-GWAS) approach to jointly analyze a set of 9 common health risk factors, four common complex metabolic disease outcomes and 8.4M genetic variants recorded for 458,747 individuals in the UK Biobank. Genome-wide, we find that very few genetic variants are suitable MR IVs, with only 696 variants remaining when analyzing all traits jointly. While we replicate almost all paths previously found by CAUSE between risk factors and outcomes, we show that only few of these reflect direct adjacencies and that many cannot be distinguished from unmeasured confounding within the UK Biobank data. Our results suggest that well-curated longitudinal records and family data are likely needed to overcome the mixtures of temporal precedence and reverse-causality in biobank data. Our approach provides a first-step toward robust principled screening for potential causal links to understand the underlying nature of phenotypic correlations in biobank data.

**Abstract:**
Aquatic animals offer compelling evidence that flow sensing alone, without vision, is sufficient to guide a swimming organism to the source of an unsteady hydrodynamic trail. However, the sensory feedback strategies that allow these remarkable trail tracking abilities remain opaque. Here, by integrating mechanistic flow simulations with reinforcement learning techniques, we discovered two simple and equally effective strategies for hydrodynamic trail following. Though not a priori obvious, these strategies possess parsimonious interpretations, analogous to Braitenbergs simplest vehicles, where the agent senses local flow signals and turns away from or toward the direction of stronger signals. A rigorous stability analysis shows that the effectiveness of these strategies in robustly tracking flow currents is independent of the type of sensor but depends on sensor placement and the traveling nature of the flow signal. Importantly, these results inform a suite of versatile strategies for hydrodynamic trail following applicable to both vortical and turbulent flows. These insights support the future design and implementation of adaptive real-time sensory feedback strategies for autonomous robots in dynamic flow environments.

**Abstract:**
Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have demonstrated robust induction of neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T cell activation, however CD8+ responses are variable, and the duration of immunity and protection against variants are limited. Here we repurposed our DNA origami vaccine nanotechnology, DoriVac, for targeting infectious viruses, namely SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and Ebola. The DNA origami nanoparticle, conjugated with infectious-disease-specific heptad repeat 2 (HR2) peptides, which act as highly conserved antigens, and CpG adjuvant at precise nanoscale spacing, induced neutralizing antibodies, Th1 CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in naive mice, with significant improvement over a bolus control. Pre-clinical studies using lymph-node-on-a-chip systems validated that DoriVac, when conjugated with antigenic peptides or proteins, induced promising cellular and humoral immune responses in human cells. Moreover, DoriVac bearing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein achieved immune responses comparable to current mRNA vaccine platforms while potentially reducing storage constraints. These results suggest that DoriVac holds potential as a versatile, modular vaccine platform, capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immunities, underscoring its potential utility in addressing future pandemics.

**Abstract:**
The ENCODE project has revolutionized our understanding of functional genomic elements, yet its exhaustive approach remains inaccessible to smaller communities studying non-model organisms. To address this challenge, we developed the miniENCODE framework - a resource-efficient strategy combining carefully selected experimental assays with an integrated computational platform. Using zebrafish as a model, we implemented this framework through three core assays: RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K27ac CUT\&Tag, spanning six developmental stages and 11 adult tissues. Our analysis identified 52,350 candidate enhancer-like signatures, characterized their spatiotemporal activity patterns, and experimentally validated tissue-specific enhancers. We developed the mini Omics Data Portal (miniODP) to facilitate multi-omics data re-use, integration, visualization, and analysis. Through this platform, we characterized key transcription factors and their regulatory networks in various developmental stages and adult tissues. Extending this approach to additional model organisms (cattle, lancelet, Mexican tetra, and polyp), we demonstrated its broad applicability for understanding gene regulation in diverse species. The miniENCODE framework provides a practical solution for comprehensive regulatory element characterization, enabling smaller research communities to advance genomic studies in understudied organisms without overextending their resources. This approach not only provides a valuable resource for zebrafish but also establishes a scalable model for accelerating genomic research in diverse species.

**Abstract:**
Aging is a predominant risk factor for heart disease. Aging heart reveals low-grade chronic inflammation, cell apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and increased vulnerability to ischemic injury. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the cardiac aging phenotype and its susceptibility to injury are far from being fully understood. Although previous literature reports a role of the mitochondrial enzyme arginase-II (Arg-II) in development of heart failure, contradictory results are reported and no systematic analysis of cellular expression and localization of Arg-II in the heart has been performed. Whether and how Arg-II participates in cardiac aging are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrate, to our surprise, that Arg-II is not expressed in cardiomyocytes from aged mice and human patients, but upregulated in non-myocytes of the aging heart, including macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells. Mice with genetic deficiency of arg-ii (arg-ii-/-) are protected from age-associated cardiac inflammation, myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and susceptibility to ischemic injury. Further experiments show that Arg-II mediates IL-1{beta} release from macrophages of old mice, contributing to the above-described cardiac aging phenotype. In addition, Arg-II enhances mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and activates cardiac fibroblasts that is inhibited by inhibition of mtROS. Thus, our study demonstrates a non-cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II on cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells mediated by IL-1{beta} from aging macrophages as well as a cell-autonomous effect of Arg-II through mtROS in fibroblasts contributing to cardiac aging phenotype.

## Local Inhibitory Dynamics Underpin Temporal Integration and Functional Segregation between Barrels and Septa in the Mouse Barrel Cortex

**Abstract:**
Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker Brainstem Thalamus Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking activity upon multi-whisker stimulation, resembling the stable response pattern observed in barrels. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions.

## Systematic discovery of directional regulatory motifs associated with human insulator sites

**Abstract:**
Insulator proteins act as a barrier of enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs). The main insulator protein in vertebrates is CTCF, a DNA-binding protein (DBP). However, other DBPs associated with insulators of EPIs are still unclear. Hence, we developed a systematic, comprehensive deep learning-based approach for identifying the DNA motifs of DBPs associated with insulators. We discovered 97 directional and minor nondirectional motifs in human fibroblast cells that corresponded to 23 DBPs related to insulator function, CTCF, and/or other types of chromosomal transcriptional regulation reported in previous studies. The estimated CTCF orientation bias was consistently proportional to CTCF orientation bias observed in chromatin interactions. The motifs were significantly more abundant at insulator sites separated by repressive and active regions, at boundary sites identified by chromatin interaction data, and at splice sites than other DBPs. For instance, we found that the key regulator MyoD-binding site is located at an insulator site near a gene involved in skeletal muscle differentiation and function. Finally, the insulator-pairing model explains that homologous and heterologous insulator-insulator pairing interactions are orientation-dependent. These findings contribute to elucidate novel transcriptional regulations.

## Cellular morphodynamics as quantifiers for functional states of resident tissue macrophages in vivo

**Abstract:**
Resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) are essential for tissue homeostasis. Their diverse functions, from monitoring interstitial fluids to clearing cellular debris, are accompanied by characteristic morphological changes that reflect their functional status. While current knowledge of macrophage behaviour comes primarily from in vitro studies, their dynamic behavior in vivo is fundamentally different, necessitating a more physiologically relevant approach to their understanding.

In this study, we employed intravital imaging to generate dynamic data from peritoneal RTMs in mice under various conditions and developed a comprehensive image processing pipeline to quantify RTM morphodynamics over time, defining human-interpretable cell size and shape features. These features allowed for the quantitative and qualitative differentiation of cell populations in various functional states, including pro- and anti-inflammatory activation and endosomal dysfunction. The study revealed that under steady-state conditions, RTMs exhibit a wide range of morphodynamical phenotypes, constituting a naive morphospace of behavioral motifs. Upon challenge, morphodynamic patterns changed uniformly at the population level but predominantly within the constraints of this naive morphospace. Notably, aged animals displayed a markedly shifted naive morphospace, indicating drastically different behavioral patterns compared to their young counterparts. The developed method also proved valuable in optimizing explanted tissue setups, bringing RTM behavior closer to the physiological native state. Our versatile approach thus provides novel insights into the dynamic behavior of bona fide macrophages in vivo, enabling the distinction between physiological and pathological cell states and the assessment of functional tissue age on a population level.

Author summaryIn this study, we combine state-of-the-art in vivo imaging with advanced computational analysis to reveal the dynamic behavior of peritoneal resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) in their natural environment. These sentinel cells, which are crucial for tissue homeostasis, constantly monitor their environment and, in the process, undergo dynamic morphological changes that have remained largely uninvestigated due to technical limitations. Using two-photon microscopy, we captured time-lapse images of RTMs in the peritoneal serosa under various experimental conditions. Our customized image processing pipeline allowed a comprehensive assessment of cell morphology and dynamics and provided unprecedented insights into the behavior of RTMs in vivo, enabling us to distinguish cell populations in different physiological and pathological states. Our work opens up new avenues for the dynamic in situ phenotyping of macrophage functionality in disease contexts without their extraction from tissues and provides a novel perspective on the behavior of RTMs in their natural microenvironment. This versatile tool promises to advance our understanding of tissue homeostasis and macrophage function in health and disease, with potential applications in both basic research and clinical settings.

## Complex interactions in the life cycle of a simple parasite shape the evolution of virulence

**Abstract:**
Evolutionary expectations about the virulence of parasites (i.e., the parasite-induced mortality rate of the host) often focus solely on the within-host transmission stage, overlooking the time spent between hosts and variations in transmission cycles. Moreover, the parasite growth rate within the host is closely linked to virulence. We here suggest that a simplified view of transmission and parasite evolution makes predicting how virulence will evolve difficult. We illustrate our ideas with a parasite with a simple life cycle, the microsporidian Vavraia culicis, which infects the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. We selected the parasite over six host generations for early or late host transmission, corresponding to shorter or longer time within the host. Selecting for late transmission increased their exploitation of the host, resulting in higher host mortality and a shorter life cycle with rapid infective spore production, comparatively to selection for early transmission. In response, hosts infected with late-selected spores shortened their life cycle and shifted to earlier reproduction. Using different host harm metrics, we demonstrate and discuss the pros and cons of using different it as measures of virulence. These and other findings emphasize the importance of considering the entire transmission cycle in studies of parasite evolution and raise concerns about how host density and social settings might influence virulence evolution.

## Many weak and few strong links: The importance of interaction strength distributions for stabilising patterns in competition networks

**Abstract:**
Ecological networks tend to contain many weak and only few strong interactions. Furthermore, interaction strengths are often arranged or patterned in ways that enhance stability. However, little attention has been given to the relation between the "many weak and few strong links" distribution and the stabilising effect of patterning. Here, we focus on the stabilising effect of hierarchy in bryozoan competition networks, and demonstrate that it critically depends on a skewed distribution of interaction strengths. To this end, we first show that, in line with many other ecological networks, the empirically derived interaction strengths in competition networks were characterised by a high level of skewness, with many weak and few strong links. Then, we analysed the relationship between the interaction strength distributions, hierarchy and stability by comparing theoretical competition matrices with different distributions of interaction strengths. We found that the full stabilising effect of hierarchy only appeared when we used skewed interaction strengths produced by a gamma distribution, but not in matrices built with uniform or half-normal distributions. This has important methodological implications, since theoretical studies often assume normal or uniform distributions to study ecological stability, and therefore might overlook stabilising mechanisms. We conclude that since skewed interaction strengths are a common feature of ecological networks, they can be expected to play an important role in the relation between structure and stability in living systems.

**Abstract:**
Sequence-specific interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with genomic DNA underlie many cellular processes. High-throughput in vitro binding assays coupled with machine learning have made it possible to accurately define such molecular recognition in a biophysically interpretable way for hundreds of TFs across many structural families, providing new avenues for predicting how the sequence preference of a TF is impacted by disease-associated mutations in its DNA binding domain. We developed a method based on a reference-free tetrahedral representation of variation in base preference within a given structural family that can be used to accurately predict the effect of mutations in the protein sequence of the TF. Using the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain families as test cases, our results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately predicting the shifts ({Delta}{Delta}{Delta}G/RT) in binding free energy associated with TF mutants by leveraging high-quality DNA binding models for sets of homologous wild-type TFs.

**Abstract:**
KvS proteins are voltage-gated potassium channel subunits that form functional channels when assembled into heteromers with Kv2.1 (KCNB1) or Kv2.2 (KCNB2). Mammals have 10 KvS subunits: Kv5.1 (KCNF1), Kv6.1 (KCNG1), Kv6.2 (KCNG2), Kv6.3 (KCNG3), Kv6.4 (KCNG4), Kv8.1 (KCNV1), Kv8.2 (KCNV2), Kv9.1 (KCNS1), Kv9.2 (KCNS2), and Kv9.3 (KCNS3). Electrically excitable cells broadly express channels containing Kv2 subunits and most neurons have substantial Kv2 conductance. However, whether KvS subunits contribute to these conductances has not been clear, leaving the physiological roles of KvS subunits poorly understood. Here, we identify that two potent Kv2 inhibitors, used in combination, can distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers and Kv2-only channels. We find that Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, or Kv9-containing channels are resistant to the Kv2-selective pore-blocker RY785 yet remain sensitive to the Kv2-selective voltage sensor modulator guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX). Using these inhibitors in mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons, we find predominantly RY785-sensitive conductances consistent with channels composed entirely of Kv2 subunits. In contrast, RY785-resistant but GxTX-sensitive conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels predominate in mouse and human dorsal root ganglion neurons. These results establish an approach to pharmacologically distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers from Kv2-only channels, enabling investigation of the physiological roles of endogenous KvS subunits. These findings suggest that drugs which distinguish KvS subunits could modulate electrical activity of subsets of Kv2-expressing cell types.

**Abstract:**
Endolysins are highly evolved bacteriophage-encoded lytic enzymes produced to damage the bacterial cell wall for phage progeny release. They offer promising potential as highly specific lytic proteins with a low chance of bacterial resistance. The diversity in lysin sequences and domain organization can be staggering. In silico analysis of bacteriophage and prophage genomes can help identify endolysins exhibiting unique features and high antibacterial activity, hence feeding the pipeline of narrow-spectrum protein antibiotics. Mycobacteriophage lysis cassettes mostly have two lytic enzymes, LysinA and LysinB. The enzyme LysinA targets peptidoglycan in the cell wall and possesses a modular architecture. LysinB typically contains a single domain and acts upon the mycolyl ester linkages in mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (Payne et al., 2010). This study aimed to find novel LysinBs against Mycobacterium fortuitum. After a detailed in silico characterization of lysis cassettes from three M. fortuitum prophages, we chose to work on a LysinB (hereafter described as LysinB_MF) found in an incomplete prophage (phiE1336, 9.4 kb in strain E1336). LysinB_MF showed low sequence similarity with any other endolysins in the database and formed a separate clade on phylogenetic analysis. LysinB_MFs structure, extracted from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, demonstrated a modular architecture with two structurally distinct domains: a peptidoglycan-binding domain (PGBD) at the N-terminal and the characteristic alpha/beta hydrolase domain connected via a linker peptide. We found the alpha/beta hydrolase domain, which is the enzyme-active domain (EAD), contains the conserved Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad with a tunnel-like topology and forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The PGBD shows structural similarity to the cell-wall binding domain of an amidase from Clostridium acetobutylicum, hinting at its acquisition due to domain mobility. Our in silico electrostatic potential analysis suggested that PGBD might be essential to the enzyme activity. Based on our analysis, PGBD emerged as an integral constituent of enzymes with diverse functional properties and is predicted to be conserved cross-kingdom. Overall, this study highlights the importance of mining mycobacterial prophages as a novel endolysin source. It also provides unique insights into the diverse architecture of mycobacteriophage-encoded endolysins and the importance of functional domains for their catalytic activities.

**Abstract:**
Emotional experiences are never static but continuously evolve in response to internal and external contexts. Little is known about how neural patterns change as a function of these experiences, particularly in response to complex, real-world stimuli. This study aimed to identify generalizable neural patterns as individuals collectively engage and disengage from emotions dynamically. To do so, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with subjective emotional annotations from two independent studies as individuals watched negative and neutral movie clips. We used predictive modeling to test if a model trained to predict a group emotional signature response in one study generalizes to the other study and vice versa. Disengagement patterns generalized specifically across intense clips. They were supported by connections within and between the sensorimotor and salience networks, maybe reflecting the processing of feeling states as individuals regulate their emotions. Prediction success for the engagement signature was mixed, primarily linked to connections within the visual and between the visual and dorsal attention networks, supporting visual attention orienting as emotions intensify. This work offers potential pathways for identifying generalizable neural patterns contributing to future affective research and clinical applications aiming to better understand dynamic emotional responses to naturalistic stimuli.

## The MAP2Ks can use ADP to phosphorylate and activate their substrate MAPKs in vitro

**Abstract:**
Kinases are a diverse group of enzymes that use ATP to phosphorylate a variety of substrates. Protein kinases evolved in eukaryotes as important mediators of cell signalling that target specific amino acid side chains to modulate downstream protein function. Among them, the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) are a family of intracellular protein kinases that form signalling cascades responding to a number of stimuli, that control fundamental mechanisms such as proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and cell death. Signals propagate through consecutive kinases which eventually phosphorylate and activate a MAPK. Here, we show that the dual specificity threonine/tyrosine MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks or MEKs) are able to phosphorylate and activate their substrate MAPKs using ADP as well as ATP in vitro. As the pathways are involved in the stress response, we speculate that it would represent an advantage to be able to maintain signalling under conditions such as hypoxia, that occur under a number of cell stresses, including cancer and atherosclerosis, where the available pool of ATP could be depleted.

**Abstract:**
Cell cycle progression is governed by complexes of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their regulatory subunits cyclin and Cks1. CDKs phosphorylate hundreds of substrates, often at multiple sites. Multisite phosphorylation depends on Cks1, which binds initial priming phosphorylation sites to promote secondary phosphorylation at other sites. Here, we describe a similar role for a recently discovered phosphate-binding pocket (PP) on B-type cyclins. Mutation of the PP in Clb2, the major mitotic cyclin of budding yeast, alters bud morphology and delays the onset of anaphase. Mutation of the PP reduces multi-site phosphorylation of CDK substrates in vitro, including the Cdc16 and Cdc27 subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and the Bud6 and Spa2 subunits of the polarisome. We conclude that the cyclin PP, like Cks1, controls the pattern of multisite phosphorylation on CDK substrates, thereby helping to establish the robust timing of cell-cycle events.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundFocused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging non-invasive technique for neuromodulation in the central nervous system (CNS). Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) leverages ultrafast Power Doppler Imaging (PDI) to detect changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV), which correlate well with neuronal activity and thus hold promise to monitor brain responses to FUS.

ObjectiveInvestigate the immediate and short-term effects of transcranial FUS neuromodulation in the brain with fUSI by characterizing hemodynamic responses.

MethodsWe designed a setup that aligns a FUS transducer with a linear array to allow immediate subsequent monitoring of the hemodynamic response with fUSI during and after FUS neuromodulation (FUS-fUSI) in lightly anesthetized mice. We investigated the effects of varying pressures and transducer positions on the hemodynamic responses.

ResultsWe found that higher FUS pressures increase the size of the activated brain area, as well as the magnitude of change in CBV and could show that sham sonications did not produce hemodynamic responses. Unilateral sonications resulted in bilateral hemodynamic changes with a significantly stronger response on the ipsilateral side. FUS neuromodulation in mice with a cranial window showed distinct activation patterns that were frequency-dependent and different from the activation patterns observed in the transcranial model.

ConclusionfUSI is hereby shown capable of transcranially monitoring online and short-term hemodynamic effects in the brain during and following FUS neuromodulation.

## Optimized CART Cell Therapy for Metastatic Aggressive Thyroid Cancer

**Abstract:**
Most thyroid cancer deaths are attributed to a subset of poorly differentiated, metastatic tumors. To improve treatment options for these aggressive thyroid cancers, we developed a novel thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR)-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell therapy, which demonstrated antigen-specific activation and antitumor efficacy against TSHR-overexpressing cell lines in vitro and in vivo. However, de-differentiated thyroid cancers downregulate TSHR. We therefore developed a potent treatment strategy by combining our novel TSHR-CART cells with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, which redifferentiate thyroid tumors and upregulate TSHR expression. In patient-derived anaplastic thyroid cancer xenografts, combination therapy of TSHR-CART cells and MAPK inhibitors led to increased TSHR expression on the tumor tissue and significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy and prolonged survival compared to TSHR-CART monotherapy.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEPoor target selection and antigen escape limit CART cell efficacy in solid tumors. We developed TSHR-CART cells to treat differentiated thyroid cancers but observed TSHR downregulation in dedifferentiated thyroid cancers. We found that MAPK inhibitors restored TSHR expression and sensitized these cancers to TSHR-CART cell therapy.

## Assistive sensory-motor perturbations influence learned neural representations

**Abstract:**
Task errors are used to learn and refine motor skills. We investigated how task assistance influences learned neural representations using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), which map neural activity into movement via a decoder. We analyzed motor cortex activity as monkeys practiced BCI with a decoder that adapted to improve or maintain performance over days. Over time, task-relevant information became concentrated in fewer neurons, unlike with fixed decoders. At the population level, task information also became largely confined to a few neural modes that accounted for an unexpectedly small fraction of the population variance. A neural network model suggests the adaptive decoders directly contribute to forming these more compact neural representations. Our findings show that assistive decoders manipulate error information used for long-term learning computations like credit assignment, which informs our understanding of motor learning and has implications for designing real-world BCIs.

**Abstract:**
Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) are well validated antimicrobial targets, but the prevalence of {beta}-lactamase driven resistance and, more rarely, target-based mutations, necessitates new classes of PBP-targeting drugs. Here we describe the discovery and optimisation of novel, bicyclic peptide (Bicycle(R)) inhibitors of E. coli PBP3 (EcPBP3) using a proprietary phage display platform, and their conjugation to linear antimicrobial peptides to confer outer membrane permeation. These molecules exhibited high-affinity binding to E. coli PBP3 and a viable spectrum of killing activity against clinically relevant species of the Enterobacterales. X-ray crystallography was used to explore the mode of binding to PBP3, enabling increased target affinity and improvement of in vitro stability. These compounds bind to the transpeptidase active site cleft of PBP3 and represent a novel non-{beta}-lactam chemical class of high affinity, non-covalent penicillin binding protein inhibitors.

**Abstract:**
Studies of in vivo chromatin organization have relied on the accessibility of the underlying DNA to nucleases or methyltransferases, which is limited by their requirement for purified nuclei and enzymatic treatment. Here, we introduce a nanopore-based sequencing technique called Small-Molecule Adduct sequencing (SMAdd-seq), where we profile chromatin accessibility by treating nuclei or intact cells with a small molecule, angelicin. Angelicin reacts with thymine bases in linker DNA not bound to core nucleosomes after UV light exposure, thereby labeling accessible DNA regions. By applying SMAdd-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that angelicin-modified DNA can be detected by its distinct nanopore current signals. To systematically identify angelicin modifications and analyze chromatin structure, we developed a neural network model, NEural network for mapping MOdifications in nanopore long-reads (NEMO). NEMO accurately called expected nucleosome occupancy patterns near transcription start sites at both bulk and single-molecule levels. We observe heterogeneity in chromatin structure and identify clusters of single-molecule reads with varying configurations at specific yeast loci. Furthermore, SMAdd-seq performs equivalently on purified yeast nuclei and intact cells, indicating the promise of this method for in vivo chromatin labeling on long single molecules to measure native chromatin dynamics and heterogeneity.

**Abstract:**
Understanding how the eyes, head, and hands coordinate in natural contexts is a critical challenge in visuomotor coordination research, often constrained by sedentary or restricted tasks and cued actions. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment where participants self-generated pick-and-place actions in a virtual environment, recording concurrent gaze and body movements. Subjects exhibited intricate translation and rotation movements of the eyes, head, and hands during the task. We employed time-dependent principal component analysis to study the relationship between the movements of the eyes, head, and hands relative to action onset. We reduced the overall dimensionality into 2D representations, capturing up to 65\% of the movement variance just in time with the actions. Our analysis revealed the eyes synchronized with the head and hands close to action onset, with variations in coupling observed in horizontal and vertical planes, indicating distinct mechanisms for coordination in the brain. Crucially, the head and hands remained tightly coupled throughout the observation period, suggesting a shared neural code driving these effectors. Notably, the low-dimensional representations of the eye-head-hand movement vectors showed maximum predictive accuracy of the upcoming action location ~200 ms before onset, highlighting just-in-time coordination among the three effectors. Furthermore, predictive accuracy was significantly influenced by the location of the upcoming action. Our study emphasizes differential visuomotor control shaped by task structure, providing insights into the dynamic interplay of eye, head, and hand movements during natural behavior.

**Abstract:**
Recycling of cellular components through autophagy maintains homeostasis in dynamic nutrient environments, and its dysregulation is linked to several human disorders. Although extensive research has characterized the core mechanisms of autophagy, limited insight into its systems-wide dynamic control has hampered predictive modeling and effective in vivo manipulation. In this study, we mapped the genetic network that controls both the dynamic activation and inactivation of autophagy during nitrogen changes, using a combination of time-resolved high-content imaging, deep learning, and latent feature analysis. This approach generated a comprehensive genome-wide profiling repository, termed AutoDRY, categorizing 5919 mutants based on their nutrient response kinetics and differential contributions to autophagosome formation and clearance. Integrating these profiles with functional and genetic network data unveiled a hierarchical and multi-layered control of autophagy, identifying new regulatory aspects of the core machinery and established nutrient-sensing pathways. By leveraging multi-omics resources and explainable machine learning to predict genetic perturbation effects and infer new regulatory mechanisms, we identified the retrograde pathway as a pivotal, time-varying autophagy modulator through transcriptional tuning of core genes. By charting the systems-wide dynamical control of autophagy, we have laid the groundwork for connecting the complexity of genome-wide influences with specific core mechanisms. This represents a significant advancement in studying complex genetic phenotypes, guides functional genomics of dynamic cellular processes in any organism, and provides a powerful starting point for hypothesis-based research on autophagy.

**Abstract:**
Drug synergy prediction is a challenging and important task in the treatment of complex diseases including cancer. In this manuscript, we present a novel unified Model, known as BAITSAO, for tasks related to drug synergy prediction with a unified pipeline to handle different datasets. We construct the training datasets for BAITSAO based on the context-enriched embeddings from Large Language Models for the initial representation of drugs and cell lines. After demonstrating the relevance of these embeddings, we pre-train BAITSAO with a large-scale drug synergy database under a multi-task learning framework with rigorous selections of tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of the model architecture and the pre-trained strategies of BAITSAO over other methods through comprehensive benchmark analysis. Moreover, we investigate the sensitivity of BAITSAO and illustrate its unique functions including new drug discoveries, drug combinations-gene interaction, and multi-drug synergy predictions.

**Abstract:**
Antimicrobial resistance threatens the viability of modern medical interventions. There is a dire need of developing novel approaches to counter resistance mechanisms employed by starved or slow-growing pathogens that are refractory to conventional antimicrobial therapies. Antimicrobial peptides have been advocated as potential therapeutic solutions due to low levels of genetic resistance observed in bacteria against these compounds. However, here we show that subpopulations of stationary phase Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survive tachyplesin treatment without genetic mutations. These phenotypic variants display enhanced efflux activity to limit intracellular peptide accumulation. Differential regulation of genes involved in outer membrane vesicle section, membrane modification, and protease activity were also found between phenotypically resistant and susceptible cells. We discovered that formation of these phenotypic variants could be prevented by administering tachyplesin in combination with sertraline, a clinically used antidepressant, suggesting a novel approach for combatting antimicrobial-refractory stationary phase bacteria.

**Abstract:**
Neural processing of sensory information takes time. Consequently, to estimate the current state of the world, the brain must rely on predictive processes - for example, extrapolating the motion of a ball to determine its probable present position. Some evidence implicates early (pre-cortical) processing in extrapolation, but it remains unclear whether extrapolation continues during later-stage (cortical) processing, where further delays accumulate. Moreover, the majority of such evidence relies on invasive neurophysiological techniques in animals, with accurate characterisation of extrapolation effects in the human brain currently lacking. Here, we address these issues by demonstrating how precise probabilistic maps can be constructed from human EEG recordings. Participants (N = 18, 2 sessions) viewed a stimulus moving along a circular trajectory while EEG was recorded. Using LDA classification, we extracted maps of stimulus location over time and found evidence of a forwards temporal shift occurring across temporally distinct processing stages. This accelerated emergence of position representations indicates extrapolation occurring at multiple stages of processing, with representations progressively shifted closer to real-time. We further show evidence of representational overshoot during early-stage processing following unexpected changes to an objects trajectory, and demonstrate that the observed dynamics can emerge without supervision in a simulated neural network via spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

**Abstract:**
Improvements in single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) assays have enabled detailed characterization of somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) at the single-cell level. Yet, current computational methods are mostly designed for detecting chromosome-scale changes in cancer samples with low sequencing coverage. Here, we introduce HiScanner (High-resolution Single-Cell Allelic copy Number callER), which combines read depth, B-allele frequency, and haplotype phasing to identify CNAs with high resolution. In simulated data, HiScanner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various CNA types and sizes. When applied to high-coverage scWGS data from 65 cells across 11 neurotypical human brains, HiScanner shows a superior ability to detect smaller CNAs, uncovering distinct CNA patterns between neurons and oligodendrocytes. We also generated low-coverage scWGS data from 179 cells sampled from the same meningioma patient at two time points. For this serial dataset, integration of CNAs with point mutations revealed evolutionary trajectories of tumor cells. These findings show that HiScanner enables accurate characterization of frequency, clonality, and distribution of CNAs at the single-cell level in both non-neoplastic and neoplastic cells.

**Abstract:**
The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural computations to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviors and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep-learning behavioral analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective-motivational behaviors without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic mu-opioid receptor promoter to drive chemogenetic inhibition in opioid-responsive ACC neurons. This targeted neuromodulation recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain. This opioid-mimetic gene therapy offers a new strategy for precision pain management by targeting a key nociceptive cortical circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

## Insights into the bioluminescence systems of three sea pens (Cnidaria: Anthozoa): from de novo transcriptome analyses to biochemical assays

**Abstract:**
Bioluminescence is the production of visible light by living organisms. It occurs through the oxidation of a luciferin substrate catalysed by luciferase enzymes. Auxiliary proteins, such as fluorescent proteins and luciferin-binding proteins, can modify the light emitted wavelength or stabilize reactive luciferin molecules, respectively. Additionally, calcium ions are crucial for the luminescence across various species. Despite the large phylogenetic distribution of bioluminescent organisms, only a few systems have been comprehensively studied. Notably, cnidarian species of the Renilla genus utilize a coelenterazine-dependent luciferase, a calcium-dependent coelenterazine-binding protein and a green fluorescent protein. We investigated the bioluminescence of three sea pen species: Pennatula phosphorea, Anthoptilum murrayi and Funiculina quadrangularis (Pennatuloidea, Anthozoa). Their light-emission spectra reveal peaks at 510, 513 and 485 nm, respectively. A coelenterazine-based reaction was demonstrated in all three species. Using transcriptome analyses, we identified predicted transcripts coding for luciferases, green fluorescent proteins and coelenterazine-binding proteins for P. phosphorea and A. murrayi. Immunodetection confirmed the expression of luciferase in P. phosphorea and F. quadrangularis. We also expressed recombinant luciferase of A. murrayi, confirming its activity. We highlighted the role of calcium ions in bioluminescence, possibly associated with the mechanism of substrate release at the level of coelenterazine-binding proteins. The study proposes a model for anthozoan bioluminescence, offering new avenues for future ecological and functional research on these luminous organisms.

Myeloid-derived regulatory cells (MDRCs) are known to control CD4+ T cell responses in asthma. We demonstrate that airway MDRC-derived sEVs from asthmatics mediate T cell receptor engagement and transfer of mitochondria that induce antigen-specific activation and polarization of Th17 and Th2 cells; these cells are drivers of chronic airway inflammation in asthma. CD4+ T cells internalize sEVs containing mitochondria predominantly by membrane fusion, and blocking mitochondrial oxidant signaling in MDRC-derived sEVs mitigates T cell activation. Reactive oxygen species-mediated signaling that elicits T cell activation in asthmatics is sEV-dependent. Additionally, a Drp1-dependent mechanism in pro-inflammatory MDRCs promotes mitochondrial packaging within sEVs, which then co-localize with the polarized cytoskeleton and mitochondrial networks in recipient T cells. Importantly, intranasal transfer of mitochondria packaged sEVs enhances airway inflammation and Th polarization in vivo in a murine model of asthma. Thus, our studies indicate a previously unrecognized role for mitochondrial fission and sEV-mediated mitochondrial transfer-mediated signaling in dysregulated T cell activation and Th cell polarization in asthma which could constitute a novel therapeutic target.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundPriming plant immunity offers a powerful and sustainable strategy for crop protection, enabling plants to respond faster and more efficiently to threats. This increased readiness is driven by transcriptional memory--molecular mechanisms that store and recall stress responses, including protein accumulation, transcription factor activity, and epigenetic modifications. However, the interplay among transcriptional stress memory, its stability, and its broader impact on plant resistance remain poorly understood.

ResultsHere, we reveal a tight link between transcriptional memory and defense priming in Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to repeated acoustic stimulations. Using a combination of experiments and computational modeling, we show that enhanced resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum after three stimulations arises from three key mechanisms: (1) preemptive activation of defense pathways in noninoculated plants, (2) increased diversification of defense-related genes, and (3) gene priming. This heightened defense state is sustained by transcriptional stress memory across thousands of genes, which is likely orchestrated by transcription factor cascades.

Challenging the conventional view that priming involves stepwise activation of distinct pathways, our findings suggest that priming instead results from the simultaneous modulation of a broad spectrum of defense pathways. This built-in redundancy enhances resilience, shielding primed plants from the genetic variability-driven resistance loss observed in naive plants. However, this same redundancy imposes strict limits on further enhancing the resistance. More frequent acoustic stimulations did not amplify the protective effect, and transcriptional memory faded within 1.5 days after stimulation ceased.

ConclusionsBy integrating experimental and computational approaches, we present a genome-scale quantitative model of stress-induced gene regulation. Our results highlight the trade-offs inherent in transcriptional memory-driven priming, revealing both its potential and its limitations in optimizing plant immunity.

**Abstract:**
GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide, are increasingly used to treat obesity--and to a lesser extent, type 2 diabetes--in children and adolescents. Despite their therapeutic promise, the impact of semaglutide on key endocrine and metabolic developmental processes during this period is not yet fully understood. To address the limited understanding of GLP-1 receptor agonists during development, we investigated the effects of chronic semaglutide treatment on growth and metabolism of weanling male mice. In juvenile mice displaying a normal growth pattern, semaglutide lowered blood glucose without affecting food intake or weight gain. In contrast, chronic semaglutide treatment in growth-stunted juveniles exacerbated linear growth impairment, despite preserving glucose-lowering effects. Transcriptomic analysis of the liver, complemented by gene expression studies in other metabolically active tissues, suggested altered energy expenditure, indicating a complex interaction between semaglutide, energy metabolism, and growth during juvenile development. These findings underscore the importance of developmental context when evaluating the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists in pediatric populations.

## A novel critic signal in identified midbrain dopaminergic neurons of mice training in operant tasks

**Abstract:**
In the canonical interpretation of dopaminergic neuron activity during Pavlovian conditioning, initially cell firing is triggered by unexpected rewards. Upon learning, activation instead follows the reward-predictive conditioned stimulus, and when expected rewards are withheld, firing is inhibited. However, little is known about dopaminergic neuron activity during the actual learning process in operant tasks. Here, we recorded optogenetically identified dopaminergic neurons of ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice training in multiple, successive operant sensory discrimination tasks. A delay between nose-poke choices and trial outcome signals (for reward or punishment) probed for instructional or predictive activity. During training, but prior to criterion performance, firing increased after correct, but not incorrect choices, but prior to outcome signals. Thus, the neurons predicted whether choices would be rewarded, despite the animals subthreshold behavioral performance. Surprisingly, these neurons also fired after reward delivery, as if the rewards had been unexpected according to the canonical view, but activity was inhibited after punishment signals, as if the reward had been expected after all. These inconsistencies suggest revision of theoretical formulations of dopaminergic neuronal activity to embody multiple roles in temporal difference learning and actor-critic models. Furthermore, on training trials when these neurons predicted that a given choice was correct and would be rewarded, surprisingly, the mice adhered to other non-rewarded and untrained task strategies (e.g., alternation). The DA neurons reward prediction activity could serve as critic signals for the choices just made. This consistent with the notion that the brain must reconcile multiple Bayesian belief representations during learning.

Significance statementThe canonical view of dopaminergic function based on classical conditioning studies evokes reward-prediction error (RPE) signaling. Here, in mice performing a series of novel operant tasks with a delay between behavioral responses and reward/punishment signals, some neurons began firing after correct (but not incorrect) responses, but prior to the trial outcome (reward/punishment) signal. Nevertheless, the animals performed at chance levels, employing behavioral strategies other than the one signaled by the neurons. Furthermore, these same neurons showed canonical RPE responses, increased firing after reward signals (interpreted as the reward being unexpected) and firing rate decreases punishment (interpreted as a reward having been expected). These findings indicate that dopaminergic neurons can participate in diverse functions underlying different behavioral strategies for learning.

## Intradental mechano-nociceptors serve as sentinels that prevent tooth damage

**Abstract:**
Pain is the anticipated output of the trigeminal sensory neurons that innervate the tooth's vital interior; however, the contribution of intradental neurons to healthy tooth sensation has yet to be defined. Here, we employ in vivo Ca2+ imaging to identify and define a population of myelinated high-threshold mechano-nociceptors (intradental HTMRs) that detect superficial structural damage of the tooth, produce pain, and initiate a jaw opening reflex. Intradental HTMRs remain inactive when direct forces are applied to the intact tooth but become responsive to forces when the structural integrity of the tooth is compromised, and the dentin or pulp is exposed. Their terminals collectively innervate the inner dentin through overlapping receptive fields, allowing them to monitor the superficial structures of the tooth. Indeed, intradental HTMRs detect superficial enamel damage and encode its degree, and their responses persist in the absence of either PIEZO2 or Nav1.8. As predicted, chemogenetic activation of intradental HTMRs results in a marked pain phenotype like that produced by systemic chemogenetic activation of nociceptors. Remarkably, optogenetic activation of intradental HTMRs triggers a rapid, jaw opening reflex via contraction of the digastric muscle. Taken together, our data indicate that intradental HTMRs serve as sentinels that guard against mechanical threats to the tooth; their activation not only triggers pain, but also results in physical tooth separation, which would prevent damage during mastication. Our work provides a new perspective of intradental neurons, highlighting their protective role, and illustrates the functional diversity of interoreceptors.

## Embodied decisions as active inference

**Abstract:**
Decision-making is often conceptualized as a serial process, during which sensory evidence is accumulated for the choice alternatives until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made and an action is executed. This decide-then-act perspective has successfully explained various facets of perceptual and economic decisions in the laboratory, in which action dynamics are usually irrelevant to the choice. However, living organisms often face another class of decisions -- called embodied decisions -- that require selecting between potential courses of actions to be executed timely in a dynamic environment, e.g., for a lion, deciding which gazelle to chase and how fast to do so. Studies of embodied decisions reveal two aspects of goal-directed behavior in stark contrast to the serial view. First, that decision and action processes can unfold in parallel; second, that action-related components, such as the motor costs associated with selecting a particular choice alternative or required to ``change mind'' between choice alternatives, exert a feedback effect on the decision taken. Here, we show that these signatures of embodied decisions emerge naturally in active inference -- a framework that simultaneously optimizes perception and action, according to the same (free energy minimization) imperative. We show that optimizing embodied choices requires a continuous feedback loop between motor planning (where beliefs about choice alternatives guide action dynamics) and motor inference (where action dynamics finesse beliefs about choice alternatives). Furthermore, our active inference simulations reveal the normative character of embodied decisions in ecological settings -- namely, achieving an effective balance between a high accuracy and a low risk of missing valid opportunities.

## Loss of mitochondrial pyruvate transport initiates cardiac glycogen accumulation and heart failure

**Abstract:**
Heart failure involves metabolic alterations including increased glycolysis despite unchanged or decreased glucose oxidation. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) regulates pyruvate entry into the mitochondrial matrix, and cardiac deletion of the MPC in mice causes heart failure. How MPC deletion results in heart failure is unknown. We performed targeted metabolomics and isotope tracing in wildtype (fl/fl) and cardiac-specific Mpc2-/- (CS-Mpc2-/-) hearts after in vivo injection of U-13C-glucose. Failing CS-Mpc2-/- hearts contained normal levels of ATP and phosphocreatine, yet these hearts displayed increased enrichment from U-13C-glucose and increased glycolytic metabolite pool sizes. 13C enrichment and pool size was also increased for the glycogen intermediate UDP-glucose, as well as increased enrichment of the glycogen pool. Glycogen levels were increased ~6-fold in the failing CS-Mpc2-/- hearts, and glycogen granules were easily detected by electron microscopy. In young, non-failing CS-Mpc2-/- hearts, increased glycolytic 13C enrichment occurred, but glycogen levels remained low and unchanged compared to fl/fl hearts. Inhibiting glycogen synthase with MZ-101 reduced cardiac glycogen levels and improved heart failure. Feeding a ketogenic diet to CS-Mpc2-/- mice reversed the heart failure and normalized the cardiac glycogen and glycolytic metabolite accumulation. Cardiac glycogen levels were also elevated in mice infused with angiotensin-II, and both the cardiac hypertrophy and glycogen levels were improved by ketogenic diet. Thus, loss of MPC in the heart causes glycogen accumulation and heart failure, while inhibition of glycogen synthesis or a ketogenic diet can reverse both the glycogen accumulation and heart failure.

**Abstract:**
It is vital to understand the genomic basis of differences in ecologically important traits if we are to understand the impact of global change on biodiversity and enhance our ability for targeted intervention. This study explores the potential of a novel genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach for identifying loci underlying quantitative polygenic traits in natural populations, based on phenotypic population means and genome-wide allele frequency data as obtained e.g. by PoolSeq approaches. Extensive population genetic forward simulations demonstrate that the approach is generally effective for oligogenic and moderately polygenic traits and relatively insensitive to low heritability. However, applicability is limited for highly polygenic architectures and pronounced population structure. The required sample size is moderate with very good results being obtained already for a few dozen populations scored. When combined with machine learning for feature selection, the method performs very well in predicting population means. The data efficiency of the method, particularly when using pooled sequencing and bulk phenotyping, makes GWAS studies more accessible for research in biodiversity genomics. Moreover, in a direct comparison to individual based GWAS, the proposed method performed constistently better with regard to the number of true positive loci identified and prediction accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the promise of popGWAS for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in natural populations.

## A computational approach to understanding effort-based decision-making in depression

**Abstract:**
ObjectiveMotivational dysfunction is a core feature of depression, and can have debilitating effects on everyday function. However, it is unclear which disrupted cognitive processes underlie impaired motivation, and whether impairments persist following remission. Decision-making concerning exerting effort to obtain rewards offers a promising framework for understanding motivation, especially when examined with computational tools which can offer precise quantification of latent processes.

MethodsEffort-based decision-making was assessed using the Apple Gathering Task, in which participants decide whether to exert effort via a grip-force device to obtain varying levels of reward; effort levels were individually calibrated and varied parametrically. We present a comprehensive computational analysis of decision-making, initially validating our model in healthy volunteers (N=67), before applying it in a case-control study including current (N=41) and remitted (N=46) unmedicated depressed individuals, and healthy volunteers with (N=36) and without (N=57) a family history of depression.

ResultsFour fundamental computational mechanisms that drive patterns of effort-based decisions, which replicated across samples, were identified: overall bias to accept effort challenges; reward sensitivity; and linear and quadratic effort sensitivity. Traditional model-agnostic analyses showed that both depressed groups showed lower willingness to exert effort. In contrast with previous findings, computational analysis revealed that this difference was primarily driven by lower effort acceptance bias, but not altered effort or reward sensitivity.

ConclusionsThis work provides insight into the computational mechanisms underlying motivational dysfunction in depression. Lower willingness to exert effort could represent a trait-like factor contributing to symptoms, and might represent a fruitful target for treatment and prevention.

**Abstract:**
Supervised machine learning models depend on training datasets with positive and negative examples. Therefore, dataset composition directly impacts model performance and bias. Given the importance of machine learning for immunotherapeutic design, we examined how different negative class definitions affect model generalization and rule discovery for antibody-antigen binding. Using synthetic structure-based binding data, we evaluated models trained with various definitions of negative sets. Our findings reveal that high out-of-distribution performance can be achieved when the negative dataset contains more similar samples to the positive dataset despite a lower within-distribution performance. Furthermore, leveraging ground truth information, we show that binding rules discovered as associated with positive data change based on the negative data used. Validation on experimental data supported simulation-based observations. This work underscores the role of dataset composition, including negative data selection, in creating robust, generalizable, and biology-aware sequence-based ML models.

**Abstract:**
Hearing loss is a pervasive global health challenge with profound impacts on communication, cognitive function, and quality of life. Recent studies have established age-related hearing loss as a significant risk factor for dementia, highlighting the importance of hearing loss research. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), which are electrophysiological recordings of synchronized neural activity from the auditory nerve and brainstem, serve as in vivo readouts for sensory hair cell, synaptic integrity, hearing sensitivity, and other key features of auditory pathway functionality, making them highly valuable for both basic neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics. Despite their utility, traditional ABR analyses rely heavily on subjective manual interpretation, leading to considerable variability and limiting reproducibility across studies. Here, we introduce Auditory Brainstem Response Analyzer (ABRA), a novel open-source graphical user interface powered by deep learning, which automates and standardizes ABR waveform analysis. ABRA employs convolutional neural networks trained on diverse datasets collected from multiple experimental settings, achieving rapid and unbiased extraction of key ABR metrics, including peak amplitude, latency, and auditory threshold estimates. We demonstrate that ABRAs deep learning models provide performance comparable to expert human annotators while dramatically reducing analysis time and enhancing reproducibility across datasets from different laboratories. By bridging hearing research, sensory neuroscience, and advanced computational techniques, ABRA facilitates broader interdisciplinary insights into auditory function. An online version of the tool is available for use at no cost at https://abra.ucsd.edu.

## A magnitude-independent neural code for linguistic information during sentence production

**Abstract:**
Humans are the only species with the ability to convey an unbounded number of novel thoughts by combining words into sentences. This process is guided by complex semantic and abstract syntactic representations. Despite their centrality to human cognition, the neural mechanisms underlying these systems remain obscured by inherent limitations of non-invasive brain measures and a near total focus on comprehension paradigms. Here, we address these limitations with high-resolution neurosurgical recordings (electrocorticography) and a controlled sentence production experiment. We uncover distinct cortical networks encoding word-level, semantic, and syntactic information. These networks are broadly distributed across traditional language areas, but with focal sensitivity to syntactic structure in middle and inferior frontal gyri. In contrast to previous findings from comprehension studies, these networks are largely non-overlapping, each specialized for just one of the three linguistic constructs we investigate. Most strikingly, our data reveal an unexpected property of higher-order linguistic information: it is encoded independent of neural activity levels. We propose that this "magnitude-independent coding" scheme represents a novel mechanism for encoding information, reserved for higher-order cognition more broadly.

## TarDis: Achieving Robust and Structured Disentanglement of Multiple Covariates

**Abstract:**
Addressing challenges in domain invariance within single-cell genomics necessitates innovative strategies to manage the heterogeneity of multi-source datasets while maintaining the integrity of biological signals. We introduce TarDis, a novel deep generative model designed to disentangle intricate covariate structures across diverse biological datasets, distinguishing technical artifacts from true biological variations. By employing tailored covariate-specific loss components and a self-supervised approach, TarDis effectively generates multiple latent space representations that capture each continuous and categorical target covariate separately, along with unexplained variation. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TarDis outperforms existing methods in data integration, covariate disentanglement, and robust out-of-distribution predictions. The models capacity to produce interpretable and structured latent spaces, including its pioneering work in ordered latent representations for continuous covariates, markedly enhances its utility in hypothesis-driven research. Consequently, TarDis offers a promising analytical platform for advancing scientific discovery, providing insights into cellular dynamics, and enabling targeted therapeutic interventions.

Progress and potentialModern single-cell genomics provides an unprecedented view into cellular heterogeneity, yet the very richness that propels new discoveries also complicates downstream analysis. Gene-expression patterns emerge from overlapping biological processes (e.g., differentiation programs, disease progression) and extrinsic factors (e.g., laboratory protocols, technical artifacts). Disentanglement, in this context, aims to parse these intertwined influences into interpretable latent representations, a crucial step for elucidating how complex covariates shape cellular states. While methods that correct for batch effects have become standard, these strategies often fall short in achieving the deeper objective of capturing subtle, high-dimensional biological dynamics. In single-cell experiments, cells navigate intricate developmental trajectories, respond nonlinearly to environmental or pharmaceutical perturbations, and exhibit myriad context-specific behaviors. Without disentanglement, these diverse signals frequently remain intermingled, limiting biological interpretability and hindering hypothesis-driven research.

Disentangling biological covariates is particularly vital for addressing nuanced questions in single-cell research. For example, in a disease model involving multiple genetic variants and variable drug dosing, researchers may wish to examine the effect of each variant independently or investigate how dosage influences a specific mutant background. Similarly, in developmental biology, uncovering how cells evolve across a continuum of pseudotime (e.g., from pluripotent to fully differentiated states) is critical for identifying the genes that orchestrate fate decisions while isolating the influence of developmental time from tissue-specific contexts, along with other confounding factors such as culture conditions, sample preparation, or donor genetic characteristics. Alternatively, disentangling lineage commitment signals from spatial patterning cues enables the identification of master regulators driving fate decisions. Moreover, by explicitly isolating and representing each covariate as an independent latent dimension, one can systematically navigate and interrogate a rich multidimensional covariate space. This approach extends beyond merely observing biological states, it enables exploration of novel or unmeasured cellular conditions through latent-space manipulations. For instance, disentangled latent spaces could allow researchers to computationally predict cellular responses at drug dosages or developmental stages that were never experimentally observed, significantly broadening the scope and predictive power of experimental datasets. Such analyses yield testable hypotheses for unexplored biological phenomena and enable informed planning of subsequent experimental validations.

The challenge of covariate disentanglement stems fundamentally from the complexity of modeling joint distributions of gene expression conditioned simultaneously on multiple covariates, both categorical (e.g., tissue type, disease condition) and continuous (e.g., pseudotime, dosage). This is inherently an underdetermined problem because single-cell measurements represent only sparse snapshots within a vast combinatorial space of covariate conditions. Conventional modeling approaches often conflate correlated covariates, collapsing biological variability into ambiguous latent factors, and typically fail to explicitly create separate latent representations for disentangled covariates. Moreover, continuous covariates introduce an additional layer of complexity; yet discretizing them artificially imposes arbitrary boundaries, obscuring subtle transitions and hindering accurate capture of biological gradients. Therefore, preserving the continuous nature of such covariates in disentangled representations is critical, as it maintains their intrinsic ordering and enables researchers to discern nuanced biological shifts--such as identifying thresholds in dose-response relationships or characterizing gradual developmental transitions--in a naturally interpretable manner.

The key idea in this paper is to devise a tailored deep generative model for systematically separating both categorical and continuous covariates into independent latent dimensions, while still ensuring coherent integration of the underlying gene-expression data. By explicitly targeting these covariates and preserving continuous variables as smooth, ordered latent axes, our approach clarifies complex interactions and uncovers nuanced patterns that remain concealed under standard analyses. The resulting disentangled representations can then support robust out-of-distribution generalizations, refined differential analyses, and more principled hypotheses about how diverse factors interact to drive cellular variation.

## Learning and cognition in highspeed decision making

**Abstract:**
It is widely accepted that more time and information yield better decisions. However, some decisions manage to combine speed and accuracy in an unusual way. Potentially their trick could be to use simplifying heuristics that works well for the most common condition but would lack flexibility otherwise. Here we describe an unexpected level of flexibility in a complex highspeed decision that is made faster than an Olympic sprinter can respond to the start gun. In this decision, archerfish observe the initial speed, direction, and height of falling prey and then use these initial values to turn right towards were ballistically falling prey would later land. To analyze the limits in flexibility of this highspeed decision we first developed and critically tested a system that allowed us to replace the usual ballistic relation between initial prey motion and the expected landing point with another deterministic rule. We discovered that, surprisingly, adult fish could reprogram their highspeed decision to the new rule. Moreover, after reprogramming their decision fish were immediately able to generalize their decision to novel untrained settings, showing a remarkable degree of abstraction in how the decision circuit represented the novel rule. The decision circuit is even capable of simultaneously using two distinct sets of rules, one for each of two visually distinct objects. The flexibility and level of cognition are unexpected for a decision that lacks a speed-accuracy tradeoff and is made in less than 100 ms. Our findings demonstrate the enormous potential highspeed decision making can have and strongly suggest that we presently underappreciate this form of decision making.

**Abstract:**
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Previous studies have reported more than 50 CME accessory proteins; however, the mechanism driving the invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) remains elusive. We show by quantitative live cell imaging that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCDC32, a poorly characterized endocytic accessory protein, leads to the accumulation of unstable flat clathrin assemblies. CCDC32 interacts with the -appendage domain (AD) of AP2 in vitro and with full length AP2 complexes in cells. Deletion of aa78-98 in CCDC32, corresponding to a predicted -helix, abrogates AP2 binding and CCDC32s early function in CME. Furthermore, clinically observed nonsense mutations in CCDC32, which result in C-terminal truncations that lack aa78-98, are linked to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome (CFNDS). Overall, our data demonstrate the function of a novel endocytic accessory protein, CCDC32, in regulating CCP stabilization and invagination, critical early stages of CME.

SummaryWe show that CCDC32, a poorly studied and functionally ambiguous protein, binds to AP2 and regulates CCP stabilization and invagination. Clinically observed mutations in CCDC32 lose their ability to interact with AP2 likely contributing to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome.

## Estimates of molecular convergence reveal genes with intermediate pleiotropy underlying adaptive variation across teleost fish

**Abstract:**
Molecular convergence, where specific non-synonymous changes in protein-coding genes lead to identical amino acid substitutions across multiple lineages, provides strong evidence of adaptive evolution. Detecting this signal across diverse taxa can reveal broad evolutionary mechanisms that may not be apparent when studying individual lineages. In this study, we search for convergent substitutions in the most speciose group of vertebrates, teleost fishes. Using an unsupervised approach, we detected convergence in 89 protein-coding genes across 143 chromosomal-level genomes. To assess their functional implications, we integrate data on protein properties, gene expression across species and tissues, single-cell RNA sequencing of zebrafish embryonic development, and gene perturbation experiments in zebrafish. The convergent genes were associated with diverse processes including embryonic development, tissue morphogenesis, metabolism, and responses to hormones and heat stress. The convergent substitutions altered amino acid properties, with some occurring at functionally critical sites. Notably, only one-third of these genes were tissue-specific, while the majority were expressed across multiple tissues and cell types. Genetic perturbation data further showed that the convergent genes can affect multiple structures across diverse tissues. These results highlight the pleiotropic nature of the convergent genes. Using an evolutionary modeling approach, we show that adaptive variation tends to accumulate in genes with intermediate pleiotropy, enabling organisms to overcome selective pressures during ecological shifts. Although traditionally considered a source of constraint, we argue that adaptation via genes with intermediate pleiotropy might be particularly advantageous following periods of ecological shifts, and can potentially lead to the evolution of convergent phenotypes.

**Abstract:**
Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures supports long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and home literacy environment, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to second-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop early in infancy but undergo further refinement between birth and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.

**Abstract:**
Structural heterogeneity due to varying compostions and dynamic conformations of macromolecules in cellular environment in situ presents significant challenges to biological discovery by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). In this paper, we present OPUS-TOMO, a unified deep learning framework for analyzing structural heterogeneity throughout the cryo-ET workflow. The method adopts a convolutional Encoder-Decoder architecture that adeptly maps real-space subtomograms onto a smooth low-dimensional latent space, allowing capture of the complete landscape of compositional and conformational variations of macromolecules in cryoET data. OPUS-TOMO also incorporates multiple effective techniques such as a per-particle 3D CTF model and an end-to-end pose correction network specifically for cryo-ET data. Applications of OPUS-TOMO to several real cryo-ET datasets demonstrate its outstanding capacities in resolving structural heterogeneity at various stages of cryo-ET reconstruction. The development of advanced methodologies such as OPUS-TOMO would potentially accelerate the quest for understanding biological mechanisms in situ on a proteomic scale at molecular levels in the broad tomography community.

**Abstract:**
Predicting viral evolution presents a significant challenge and is a critical public health priority. In response to this challenge, we develop a novel model for viral evolution that considers a trade-off between immunity evasion and transmissibility. The model selects for a new strain with the highest invasion fitness, taking into account this trade-off. When the dominant strain of the pathogen is highly transmissible, evolution tends to favor immune evasion, whereas for less contagious strains the direction of evolution leads toward increasing transmissibility. Assuming a linear functional form of this trade-off, we can express the long-term evolutionary patterns following the emergence of subsequent strains by a non-linear difference equation. We provide sufficient criteria for when evolution converges, and successive strains exhibit similar transmissibility. We also identify scenarios characterized by a two-periodic pattern in upcoming strains, indicating a situation where a highly transmissible but not immune-evasive strain is replaced by a less transmissible but highly immune-evasive strain, and vice versa, creating a cyclic pattern. Finally, we show that under certain conditions, viral evolution becomes chaotic and thus future transmissibilites become unpredictable in the long run. Visualization via bifurcation diagrams elucidates our analytical findings, revealing complex dynamic behaviors that include the presence of multiple periodic solutions and extend to chaotic regimes. Our analysis provides valuable insights into the complexities of viral evolution in the light of the trade-off between immune evasion and transmissibility.

## Synergistic reinforcement learning by cooperation of the cerebellum and basal ganglia

**Authors:** Yohida, T., Sugino, H., Yamamoto, H., Tanno, S., Tamura, M., Igarashi, J., Isomura, Y., Hira, R.

**Abstract:**
The cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia are essential for flexible learning in mammals. Although traditionally thought to operate under different learning rules, recent evidence suggests that both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum may employ reinforcement learning mechanisms. This raises the question of how these structures coordinate when a common reward prediction error mechanism is active. To address this issue, we first examined output signals from the basal ganglia and cerebellum following the activity of the cerebral cortex. We recorded single-neuron activity from the output regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia - the cerebellar nuclei (CN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) - in both male and female ChR2 transgenic rats. Neurons in the CN and SNr exhibited distinct temporal response patterns; notably, the fast excitatory response in the CN, driven by mossy fiber input, was synchronized with the inhibitory response in the SNr, mediated via the direct pathway. Using these experimental findings together with connectome data, we developed both a semi-realistic spiking network model and a reservoir-based reinforcement learning model. In the latter model, successful learning depended on synaptic plasticity in both the cerebellum and basal ganglia with a temporal precision on the order of 10 ms. Furthermore, cortical {beta}-oscillations enhanced learning and optimal reinforcement learning occurred when the output of cerebellar and basal ganglia signal phase-locked at the frequency of cortical oscillation. Taken together, our results suggest that the coordinated output of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, driven by tightly tuned cortical input, underlies brain-wide synergistic reinforcement learning.

Significance StatementThe cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia support learning. Recent research suggests that both the basal ganglia and cerebellum use a similar learning process called reinforcement learning, which involves predicting rewards. To understand how these brain regions work together, we recorded brain activity in rats while photo-stimulating the cerebral cortex. We found that two types of responses in the cerebellum and basal ganglia were synchronized, which might help activate the cerebral cortex. A computer model showed that precise timing of signals from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia is important for learning. This timing was important only when the cerebral cortex worked in a specific frequency range. Our findings suggest that coordinated brain activity enhances learning.

## Efficacy and mechanism of action of cipargamin as an antibabesial drug candidate

**Abstract:**
Babesiosis is a disease brought on by intraerythrocytic parasites of the genus Babesia. Current chemotherapies are accompanied by side effects and parasite relapse. Therefore, it is crucial to develop highly effective drugs against Babesia. Cipargamin (CIP) has shown inhibition against apicomplexan parasites, mainly Plasmodium and Toxoplasma. This study evaluated the growth-inhibiting properties of CIP against Babesia spp. and investigated the mechanism of CIP on B. gibsoni. The half inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of CIP against the in vitro growth of B. bovis and B. gibsoni were 20.2 {+/-} 1.4 nM and 69.4 {+/-} 2.2 nM, respectively. CIP significantly inhibited the growth of B. microti and B. rodhaini in vivo. Resistance was conferred by L921V and L921I mutations in BgATP4, which reduced the sensitivity to CIP by 6.1- and 12.8-fold. The inhibitory potency of CIP against BgATP4-associated ATPase activity was moderately reduced in mutant strains, with a 1.3-fold and 2.4-fold decrease in BgATP4L921V and BgATP4L921I, respectively, compared to that of BgATP4WT. An in silico investigation revealed reductions in affinity for CIP binding to BgATP4L921V and BgATP4L921I compared to BgATP4WT. Resistant strains showed no significant cross-resistance to atovaquone (ATO) or tafenoquine succinate (TQ), with less than a onefold change in IC50 values. Combining CIP with TQ effectively eliminated B. microti infection in SCID mice with no relapse, and parasite DNA was not detected by qPCR within 90 days post-infection. Our findings reveal the efficacy of CIP as an anti-babesial agent, its limitations as a monotherapy due to resistance development, and the potential of combination therapy with TQ to overcome said resistance and achieve complete parasite clearance.

**Abstract:**
Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2), a core component of the hPrP19 complex, plays an important role in RNA-splicing and DNA damage. However, whether BCAS2 has other functions within the nucleus remains largely unknown. Here, we show that BCAS2 is essential for primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish and mouse embryos. The activation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signal, which is required for hematopoietic progenitor differentiation, is significantly decreased upon depletion of bcas2 in zebrafish embryos and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency of bcas2 has no obvious impact on the splicing efficiency of {beta}-catenin pre-mRNA, while significantly attenuating {beta}-catenin nuclear accumulation. Moreover, we find that BCAS2 directly binds to {beta}-catenin via its coiled-coil domains, thereby sequestering {beta}-catenin within the nucleus. Thus, our results uncover a previously unknown function of BCAS2 in promoting Wnt signaling by enhancing {beta}-catenin nuclear retention during primitive hematopoiesis.

**Abstract:**
Tracking and understanding the movements of animals in the wild is a fast-growing area of research, known as movement ecology. However, tracking small animals such as flying insects, which cannot easily carry an electronic tag, remains challenging as existing field methods are costly either in terms of equipment or tracking effort (e.g. VHF radio-tracking, scanning harmonic radar). Here we attempted to record the movements of free-flying butterflies from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), maintaining a static position in the sky and recording video vertically downwards. With an appropriate flight height and image filtering algorithm, we recorded 166 flight tracks of Pieris butterflies (P. brassicae and P. rapae), with a median tracking length of 40 m (median flight duration 13 s), and a high temporal resolution of 30 positions per second. Average flight direction varied significantly over the course of the flying season, from a northward azimuth in June and early July, to a southward azimuth in September, congruent with a trans-generational migratory behaviour that has previously been documented by field observations or experiments in flight cages. In addition, UAV imagery unlocks the possibility to measure high-resolution flight movement patterns (e.g. path tortuosity and transverse oscillations), which will possibly help understand perceptual and locomotor mechanisms underlying spatial behaviour. We explore the technical details associated with UAV tracking methodology, and discuss its limitations, in particular the biases associated with a 2D projection of 3D flight movements, the limited spatial scale, and the difficulty to distinguish between visually similar species, such as P. brassicae and P. rapae.

## T6SS-mediated competition by Stenotrophomonas rhizophila shapes seed-borne bacterial communities and seed-to-seedling transmission dynamics

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
Seeds harbor diverse microbial communities important for plant growth and health. During germination, seed exudation triggers intense microbial competition, shaping the communities transmitted to seedlings. This study explores the role of the bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS)-mediated interference competition in seed microbiota transmission to seedlings. The analysis of T6SS distribution within 180 genome sequences of seed-borne bacterial strains enabled the construction of synthetic communities (SynCom) with different levels of phylogenetic diversity and T6SS richness. These SynComs were inoculated with Stenotrophomonas rhizophila CFBP13503, a bacterial strain possessing an active T6SS in vitro and in planta. The impact of T6SS on SynCom composition was assessed in vitro by comparing CFBP13503 wild-type strain or its isogenic T6SS-deficient mutant co-inoculation. Additionally, the effects of T6SS on bacterial community dynamics during seed-to-seedling transmission were examined following seed-inoculation. The T6SS of S. rhizophila CFBP13503 targets a broad range of bacteria belonging to 5 different orders. The susceptibility of competing bacteria was partly explained by their phylogenetic proximity and metabolic overlap with CFBP13503. Furthermore, the T6SS modulates the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa during seed-to-seedling transmission, depending on the initial seed inoculum and plant developmental stage. Depending on the sensitivity of the co-inoculated competitors, the T6SS can provide a competitive advantage to CFBP13503, resulting in an increase in population size.

ImportanceThe high prevalence of T6SS in seed-borne bacteria supports the importance of T6SS-mediated competition for seed microbiota assembly. In vitro, S. rhizophila CFBP13503 T6SS exerts a strong impact on bacterial community dynamics. The susceptibility to T6SS increases with the phylogenetic and metabolic proximity of bacteria to CFBP13503, suggesting an influence of interspecies trophic patterns in T6SS-mediated competitions. In planta and in soil, CFBP13503 T6SS influences specific bacterial taxa, leading to shifts in bacterial interactions and distinct community dynamics. T6SS-mediated competition plays a pivotal role in shaping seed bacterial communities and the dynamics of seed-to-seedling transitions.

**Abstract:**
De novo protein design represents a fundamental pursuit in protein engineering, yet current deep learning approaches remain constrained by their narrow design scope. Here we present Pinal, a large-scale frontier framework comprising 16 billion parameters and trained on 1.7 billion protein-text pairs, that bridges natural language understanding with protein design space, translating human design intent into novel protein sequences. Instead of a straightforward end-to-end textto-sequence generation, Pinal implements a two-stage process: first generating protein structures based on language instructions, then designing sequences conditioned on both the generated structure and the language input. This strategy effectively constrains the search space by operating in the more tractable structural domain. Through comprehensive computational evaluation, we demonstrate that Pinal achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches, including the concurrent work ESM3, while exhibiting robust generalization to novel protein structures beyond the PDB database. Lastly, we experimentally validated that four out of the eight de novo-designed alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), guided by natural language inputs, exhibited functional activity.

**Abstract:**
High-resolution energetic information about protein conformational ensembles is essential for understanding protein function, yet remains challenging to obtain. We present PIGEON-FEATHER, a method for calculating ensemble free energies of opening ({Delta}Gop) at single- or near-single-amino acid resolution for proteins of all sizes from hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry (HX/MS) data. PIGEON-FEATHER disambiguates and reconstructs all experimentally measured HX/MS isotopic mass envelopes using a Bayesian Monte Carlo sampling approach. We applied PIGEON-FEATHER to reveal how E. coli and human dihydrofolate reductases (ecDHFR, hDHFR) have evolved distinct ensembles. We show how two competitive inhibitors bind these orthologs differently, solving the longstanding mystery of why both therapeutic molecules inhibit hDHFR, but only one inhibits ecDHFR. Extending PIGEON-FEATHER to a large protein-DNA complex, we mapped ligand-induced ensemble reweighting in the E. coli lac repressor to describe the functional switching mechanism crucial for transcriptional regulation.

## Intrinsic dynamic shapes responses to external stimulation in the human brain

**Abstract:**
Sensory stimulation of the brain reverberates in its recurrent neural networks. However, current computational models of brain activity do not separate immediate sensory responses from this intrinsic dynamic. We apply a vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX), combining the concepts of "functional connectivity" and "encoding models", to intracranial recordings in humans. This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic. We find that the intrinsic dynamic enhances and prolongs the neural responses to scene cuts, eye movements, and sounds. Failing to account for these extrinsic inputs, leads to spurious recurrent connections that govern the intrinsic dynamic. We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching. The model shows that an external stimulus can reduce intrinsic noise. It also shows that sensory areas have mostly outward, whereas higher-order brain areas mostly incoming connections. We conclude that the response to an external audiovisual stimulus can largely be attributed to the intrinsic dynamic of the brain, already observed during rest.

**Abstract:**
Bovine fasciolosis is a parasitic disease of cattle caused by ingesting metacercariae of liver flukes from the genus Fasciola. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2021 to April 2022, encompassing a total of 384 cattle randomly selected from diverse locations. The study included cattle of various ages and sexes, aiming to assess the prevalence of bovine fasciolosis and identify risk factors in and around Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. Fecal examinations were performed to detect fluke eggs, and data were analyzed using descriptive statistics in STATA Version 20.0 to summarize the prevalence of bovine fasciolosis. Chi-square tests assessed relationships between infection rates and risk factors, with significance set at P < 0.05. The overall prevalence of fasciolosis was found to be 49.21%. Analysis by origin revealed that Sebatamit had the highest prevalence at 61.84%, followed by Kebele 11 at 59.37%, Tikurit at 50%, and Latammba at 27.65%. Statistical analysis showed significant differences in prevalence among the locations. In terms of body condition, cattle in poor condition had the highest prevalence (64%), followed by those in medium condition (50%) and fat cattle (26.96%). This variation was statistically significant. Age group analysis showed similar prevalence rates, with young cattle at 50.38%, adults at 47.33%, and older cattle at 50.47%, with no significant differences observed. Sex-related differences in prevalence were also not significant, with males showing a prevalence of 49.73% and females 48.73%. Regarding breed, local cattle exhibited a slightly higher prevalence (51.62%) compared to crossbreeds (46.15%), but this difference was not statistically significant ( > 0.05). In conclusion, the study highlights significant variations in the prevalence of bovine fasciolosis based on location and body condition, while no significant differences were observed among age, sex, and breed groups. These findings emphasize the importance of location-specific interventions and proper management of cattle health to control the spread of fasciolosis.

**Abstract:**
Fasciolosis is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. It is a serious public health and veterinary concern, with significant consequences for both human and livestock populations. An abattoir-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January to September 2023 at Gondar ELFORA Abattoir, Ethiopia, to assess hematobiochemical alterations and pathological lesions induced by fasciolosis in slaughtered cattle. The study involved one hundred apparently healthy male local breed cattle, evenly split into fifty infected and fifty non-infected individuals, using a purposive sampling technique. Findings showed lower mean values for hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), total erythrocyte count (TEC), lymphocytes, monocytes, total protein, albumin, and glucose. Conversely, they had higher mean values for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total leukocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, eosinophils, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Basophil levels were similar in both groups. Liver alterations observed included hepatomegaly with rounded edges and the presence of juvenile flukes in the cut section of the parenchyma. In chronic cases, the liver appeared smaller, with a firm consistency, a corrugated capsule, and dilated bile ducts containing twisted flukes. Microscopically, during the acute phase, there was infiltration of eosinophils, hemosiderin pigmentation, and congestion around the central vein and sinusoids. In contrast, chronic cases exhibited fibrosis, proliferation of bile ducts, and metaplasia of columnar to cuboidal epithelial cells. The results of hematobiochemical alterations were consistent with gross and microscopic findings, indicating a significant impact on liver physiology and histology, leading to substantial losses in meat and milk production.

## PMS2 has both pro-mutagenic and anti-mutagenic effects on repeat instability in the Repeat Expansion Diseases

**Abstract:**
Expansion of a disease-specific tandem repeat is responsible for >45 Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs). The mismatch repair protein PMS2 is a modifier of somatic expansion and disease severity in Huntingtons disease (HD), a RED resulting from a CAG-repeat expansion. However, PMS2 shows different effects in different RED models, protecting against expansion in some and promoting it in others. To better understand this difference, we carried out a systematic study of the loss of PMS2 in mouse models of HD and the fragile X-related disorders (FXDs), a group of REDs resulting from a CGG-repeat expansion. In both models, loss of one Pms2 allele resulted in more expansions, while loss of both alleles resulted in more expansion in some organs but less in others. Thus, rather than reflecting different expansion mechanisms in different diseases, the previously reported differences in different model systems likely reflects the ability of PMS2 to promote expansion in some cellular contexts and to protect against it in others. In mouse embryonic stem cells containing both sets of repeats where PMS2 was expressed under the control of a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible promoter, low DOX concentrations produced a dose-dependent increase in expansions of both repeats, an effect that was dependent on the PMS2 nuclease domain, while higher DOX levels resulted in a decrease in expansions. Our findings have implications both for the mechanism of expansion and for therapeutic approaches to treat these diseases by reducing somatic expansion.

Significance statementExpansion of a disease-specific microsatellite is responsible for >45 Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs). The mismatch repair factor PMS2 has been identified as a genetic modifier of somatic expansion and disease severity in Huntingtons disease (HD). However, loss of PMS2 has different effects in different REDs models. Using mouse and cell models of the fragile X-related disorders and HD, we show that PMS2 has both pro-mutagenic and anti-mutagenic effects in both models depending on the cell type and that an intact nuclease domain is required for its ability to promote expansion. These findings support the idea that the REDs all share a common expansion mechanism and suggests a model for repeat expansion consistent with a dual role for PMS2 in this process.

**Abstract:**
Age-related cognitive decline associations with human electroencephalography (EEG) have previously focused on periodic activity. However, EEG is primarily made up of non-oscillatory aperiodic activity, which can be characterized with an exponent and offset value. In a secondary analysis of a cohort of 111 healthy participants aged 17-71 years, we examined the associations of the aperiodic exponent and offset with a battery of cognitive tests consisting of the Colour-Word Interference Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV Digit Span Test, Rey Auditory Learning Test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Trial Making Test, and the Verbal Fluency Test. Using Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering, we identified clusters of electrodes that exhibited similar aperiodic exponent and offset activity during resting-state eyes-closed EEG. Robust linear models were then used to model how aperiodic activity interacted with age and their associations with performance during each cognitive test. Offset by age interactions were identified for the Verbal Fluency Test, where smaller offsets were associated with poorer performance in adults as early as 33 years of age. Greater aperiodic activity is increasingly related to better verbal fluency performance with age in adulthood.

## Improving Protein Interaction Prediction in GenPPi: A Novel Interaction Sampling Approach Preserving Network Topology

**Abstract:**
Computational prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding cell biology and drug development, offering a promising alternative to costly and time-consuming experimental methods. While the original GenPPi software represented an advance in ab initio PPI network prediction from bacterial genomes, its reliance on high sequence similarity limited it. In this work, we introduce the GenPPi 1.5 and enhance prediction capabilities. We incorporated a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, trained on 60 biophysical features derived from amino acid propensity indices, to overcome the previous limitation by classifying protein similarity even in low sequence identity scenarios (targeting > 65% identity). Furthermore, to address the computational complexity arising from the increased number of potential interactions generated by the RF model, especially within extensive conserved phylogenetic profiles, we developed and integrated the Reduced Interaction Sampling (RIS) algorithm. RIS stochastically samples interactions within these extensive profiles, optimizing performance for complete genome analysis. Our multifaceted methodology included integrating RF for efficient similarity classification and implementing RIS to reduce the computational burden. We evaluated the effectiveness through extensive simulations across different configurations (operational modes, Top N selected nodes, number of analyzed genomes). We rigorously assessed the network stability and structural integrity using topological metrics and statistical tests. Results demonstrate that RF integration significantly broadens GenPPi's predictive power. Application to the Buchnera aphidicola genome revealed an overlap of up to 62% with interactions documented in the STRING database, validating prediction accuracy. Analysis of the RIS algorithm showed that while introducing some randomness, critical node identification remains robust, particularly for Top N values [&ge;] 100, indicating that the edge reduction does not significantly compromise network integrity. In conclusion, combining Machine Learning and RIS represents a significant advancement. GenPPi 1.5 overcomes the high-similarity dependency while efficiently handling complex genomes, providing a robust and scalable alignment-free solution for PPI prediction. GenPPi is available at https://genppi.facom.ufu.br/ and on GitHub: https://github.com/santosardr/genppi and allows users to train custom models for specific genomic contexts.

**Abstract:**
Exercise is a multipotent stimulus that results in large-scale dynamic changes to the systemic molecular profile. Alternative exercise prescriptions and doses would be expected to result in distinct signatures due to differences in duration and intensity. We tested two novel combined endurance and resistance exercise regimens to better understand how differing prescriptions alter the acute metabolomics response at multiple timepoints up to 24h post-exercise. Serum metabolomics for n=37 untrained individuals was analyzed for participants completing traditional combined exercise [TRAD; n = 20 (11M/9F)] or high-intensity tactical training [HITT; n= 17 (8M/9F)] before exercise (pre), and immediately (h0), 3 and 24 h post-exercise (h3 and h24, respectively). We found minimal metabolites had a group by time interaction (2 with FDR < 0.10; 31 with nominal p < 0.05;), but both stimuli resulted in large-scale within-group changes to the circulating metabolome. TRAD consistently had greater numbers of differentially abundant metabolites (FDR < 0.10) as compared to HITT at h0 (431 vs. 333), h3 (435 vs. 331) and h24 (168 vs. 76). The major metabolite classes altered were related to key energy substrates for both groups at h0 (e.g., glucose, pyruvate) and energy replenishment for h3 and h24 (e.g., 12,13 diHOME, palmitoylcarnitine, free fatty acids). In summary, our data are the first to describe the acute changes in the circulating metabolome following combined endurance and resistance exercise. Additionally, we show the two distinct doses of combined exercise led to generally similar patterns of responses, with the longer duration TRAD dose resulting in a higher magnitude of change.

**Abstract:**
Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is a promising means to combat drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Infection by phage can select for mutations in bacterial populations that confer resistance against phage infection. However, resistance against phage can yield evolutionary trade-offs of biomedical relevance. Here we report the discovery that infection by certain staphylococcal phages sensitizes different strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to {beta}-lactams, a class of antibiotics against which MRSA is typically resistant. MRSA cells that survive infection by these phages display significant reductions in minimal inhibitory concentration against different {beta}-lactams compared to uninfected bacteria. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that these evolved MRSA strains possess highly modulated transcriptional profiles, where numerous genes involved in S. aureus virulence were downregulated. Phage-treated MRSA exhibited attenuated virulence phenotypes in the form of reduced hemolysis and clumping. Despite sharing similar phenotypes, whole-sequencing analysis revealed that the different MRSA strains evolved unique genetic profiles during infection. These results suggest complex evolutionary trajectories in MRSA during phage predation and open up new possibilities to reduce drug resistance and virulence in MRSA infections.

**Abstract:**
Intravital microscopy (IVM) enables live imaging of animals at single-cell resolution, offering essential insights into cancer progression. This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological and dynamic single cell features. BEHAV3D-TP is user-friendly and integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data without advanced computational expertise. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.

**Abstract:**
Caveolin is a monotopic integral membrane protein, widely expressed in metazoa and responsible for constructing enigmatic membrane invaginations known as caveolae. Recently, the high-resolution structure of a purified human caveolin assembly, the CAV1-8S complex, revealed a unique organization of 11 protomers arranged in a tightly packed, radially symmetric spiral disc. One face and the outer rim of this disc are hydrophobic, suggesting that the complex incorporates into membranes by displacing hundreds of lipids from one leaflet. The feasibility of this unique molecular architecture and its biophysical and functional consequences are currently unknown. Using Langmuir film balance measurements, we find that CAV1-8S is highly surface active, intercalating into lipid monolayers of various compositions. CAV1-8S can also incorporate into preformed bilayers, but only upon removal of phospholipids from the outer-facing leaflet. Atomistic and coarse-grained simulations of biomimetic bilayers support this  leaflet replacement model and also reveal that CAV1-8S accumulates 40-70 cholesterol molecules into a disordered monolayer between the complex and its distal lipid leaflet. We find that CAV1-8S preferentially associates with positively curved membrane surfaces due to its influence on the conformations of distal leaflet lipids, and that these effects laterally sort lipids. Large-scale simulations of multiple caveolin assemblies confirmed their association with large, positively curved membrane morphologies consistent with the shape of caveolae. Further, association with curved membranes regulates the exposure of caveolin residues implicated in protein-protein interactions. Altogether, the unique structure of CAV1-8S imparts unusual modes of membrane interaction with implications for membrane organization, morphology, and physiology.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECaveolae are membrane invaginations heavily implicated in cellular physiology and disease; however, how their unique shape and function are produced remains enigmatic. Here, following on recent characterization of the unusual structure of the CAV1-8S oligomer, we examine the molecular details of its interactions with its surrounding lipid membrane using simulations and reconstitution experiments. We describe a novel mode of membrane interaction-which we term  leaflet replacement-for the CAV1-8S complex that has not previously been observed for any other protein. The biophysical consequences of this unique molecular organization provide mechanistic insights into the functions and organization of caveolae in cells.

**Abstract:**
Social tolerance can enhance access to resources and is thought to be crucial in facilitating the evolution of cooperation, social cognition and culture, but it is unknown whether animals can optimise their social tolerance through learning. We presented wild jackdaws (Corvus monedula) with a novel social information problem using automated feeders: to access food, adults had to inhibit their tendency to displace juveniles and instead show tolerance by occupying an adjacent perch. Adults learned to tolerate juveniles, generalising across juveniles as a cohort, demonstrating learning of a new information-use strategy. The ability to learn to tolerate those that provide valuable information, and generalise across cohorts of informed individuals, may facilitate adaptive responses in the face of environmental change and help to explain the success of jackdaws in human-dominated environments.

## Microtubule depolymerization at kinetochores restricts anaphase spindle elongation

**Published/Updated:** 2025-04-03

**Abstract:**
Anaphase chromosome segregation depends on forces exerted by spindle microtubules. Current models propose two mechanisms of force generation: kinetochore microtubules (kMTs) depolymerize to pull chromosomes toward the spindle poles (anaphase A), while antiparallel microtubule sliding in the central spindle further separates the chromosomes by elongating the spindle (anaphase B). Experimental evidence in cells supports the sliding mechanism, but contributions of the depolymerization mechanism remain unclear. Here we show that kMT depolymerization limits spindle elongation rather than moving chromosomes apart. We developed a chemical optogenetic approach to recruit a microtubule depolymerase to kinetochores at anaphase onset, thereby increasing the rate of kMT depolymerization without perturbing earlier stages of mitosis. We find that increased depolymerization slows the velocity at which spindle poles move apart without changing kinetochore separation velocities. Our findings support a model in which kinetochores selectively couple to central spindle microtubules parallel to their kMTs, so that antiparallel sliding drives chromosome segregation while kMT depolymerization pulls poles inward.

**Abstract:**
We propose a learning architecture that allows symbolic control and guidance
in reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. We introduce SymDQN, a
novel modular approach that augments the existing Dueling Deep Q-Networks
(DuelDQN) architecture with modules based on the neuro-symbolic framework of
Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs). The modules guide action policy learning and
allow reinforcement learning agents to display behaviour consistent with
reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed
on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a
5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated
with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal
behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape
recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly
improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent.
The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities
of combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.

## ESAT-6 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis downregulates cofilin1, leads to filamentous actin enrichment and reduces the phagosome acidification in infected macrophages, which are partially reversed by a single methionine mutation

**Abstract:**
Mycobacterium tuberculosis when phagocytosed by macrophages is not cleared completely and many of the bacteria remain in phagosomes indefinitely. In this study we considered abnormal retention of filamentous actin on early phagosomes contributing to defective phagosome acidification. The actin depolymerizing protein cofilin1 was found downregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Also, phosphocofilin1, the inactive form of cofilin1, which leads to retention of filamentous actin, and the total filamentous actin itself were found upregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Over expression of constitutively active cofilin1 in macrophages was found to decrease the level of filamentous actin and increase phagosome acidification when infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. The anticancer drug sorafenib which activates cofilin1 in PI3K dependent manner was also found to decrease the filamentous actin level and increase phagosome acidification. Cofilin1, known to be positively regulated by superoxide was found to be downregulated by ESAT-6 of M. tuberculosis where the latter is known to reduce ROS in macrophages. Ectopic expression of ESAT-6 in macrophages was found to downregulate cofilin1, increase filamentous actin and to transform the macrophages more spindle shaped. ESAT-6 was also found to decrease phagosome acidification in macrophages infected with an avirulent M. tuberculosis strain. Finally, this study proposes a role for the amino acid methionine in resisting ROS by creating M93 mutants of ESAT-6.

## Ancient Trans-Species Polymorphism at the Major Histocompatibility Complex in Primates

**Abstract:**
Classical genes within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are responsible for peptide presentation to T cells, thus playing a central role in immune defense against pathogens. These genes are subject to strong selective pressures including both balancing and directional selection, resulting in exceptional genetic diversity--thousands of alleles per gene in humans. Moreover, some allelic lineages appear to be shared between primate species, a phenomenon known as trans-species polymorphism (TSP) or incomplete lineage sorting, which is rare in the genome overall. However, despite the clinical and evolutionary importance of MHC diversity, we currently lack a full picture of primate MHC evolution. In particular, we do not know to what extent genes and allelic lineages are retained across speciation events. To start addressing this gap, we explore variation across genes and species in our companion paper (Fortier and Pritchard, 2025) and here we explore variation within individual genes. We used Bayesian phylogenetic methods to determine the extent of TSP at 17 MHC genes, including classical and non-classical Class I and Class II genes. We find strong support for ancient TSP in 7 of 10 classical genes, including--remarkably--between humans and old-world monkeys in MHC-DQB1. In addition to the long-term persistence of ancient lineages, we additionally observe rapid evolution at nucleotides encoding the proteins' peptide-binding domains. The most rapidly-evolving amino acid positions are extremely enriched for autoimmune and infectious disease associations. Together, these results suggest complex selective forces--arising from differential peptide binding--that drive short-term allelic turnover within lineages while also maintaining deeply divergent lineages for at least 31 million years in some cases.

**Abstract:**
Sensorimotor computations for learning and behavior rely on precise patterns of synaptic connectivity. Yet, we typically lack the synaptic wiring diagrams for long-range connections between sensory and motor circuits in the brain. Here we provide the synaptic wiring diagram for sensorimotor circuits involved in learning and production of male zebra finch song, a natural and ethologically relevant behavior. We examined the functional synaptic connectivity from the 4 main sensory afferent pathways onto the 3 known classes of projection neurons of the song premotor cortical region HVC. Recordings from hundreds of identified projection neurons reveal rules for monosynaptic connectivity and the existence of polysynaptic ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in HVC. Circuit tracing further identifies novel connections between HVCs presynaptic partners. Our results indicate a modular organization of ensemble-like networks for integrating long-range input with local circuits, providing important context for information flow and computations for learned vocal behavior.

**Abstract:**
The immediate social context critically modulates drug consumption. The presence of an unfamiliar conspecific, naive to the drug, at the time of consumption reduces cocaine self-administration in male rats during short-access sessions, as well as drug intake in human cocaine users. The subthalamic nucleus (STN), a brain structure involved in cocaine addiction and limbic processes, has been proposed to mediate such social influence on this limited level of drug intake. Whether this influence extends to escalated drug consumption remains an open question. In this study, we compared the effect of the presence of an unfamiliar peer, naive to cocaine, on cocaine self-administration in rats having been exposed to either short (2h) or long-access sessions (6h). We showed that the presence of the peer drastically reduced both limited and escalated cocaine intake in males, while it had no effect on females during short-access sessions. Assessing the effect of STN photo-inhibition or high frequency (HF) stimulation in male rats, we demonstrated that it had no effect in the absence of the conspecific in short-access sessions, STN photo-manipulation suppressed the influence of the peer presence. Moreover, STN photo-inhibition and HF stimulation decreased drug consumption in long-access sessions, but no additive effect was observed when associated with the peer presence, confirming an overriding effect of STN manipulation. Taken together, these results highlight the potential influence of socially oriented manipulations on cocaine intake and further position the STN as a critical mediator of the effect of social presence on addictive-like behaviors.

**Abstract:**
Objective To integrate macro-transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing to analyze the differential gene expression between primary and brain metastatic breast cancer cells, as well as between active and dormant cancer cells within brain metastases, exploring their adaptation and remodeling abilities at different stages of brain metastasis. Methods Four public datasets were used: three mRNA microarray datasets from breast cancer and brain metastasis tissues, and one single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from active and dormant brain metastatic cells. Gene differential expression, pathway enrichment, and cell clustering analyses were performed to compare primary and metastatic breast cancer cells, as well as active and dormant cells in brain metastases, focusing on gene expression, metabolic pathways, and functional pathways. Results Metastatic breast cancer cells showed weakened pathways related to the extracellular matrix and protein digestion. Active cells exhibited enhanced cell cycle regulation, tumor proliferation, and hypoxia resistance pathways compared to dormant cells. Clustering analysis revealed that cluster 6, unique to dormant cells, had enhanced functions in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen formation, tumor inflammation siganure (TIS), and IL-10 signaling. Cluster 3 and 4 in active cells had enhanced DNA replication and tumor proliferation pathways, respectively. Conclusion This study highlights the role of cancer cell characteristics and heterogeneity in the invasiveness of brain metastasis. Understanding these mechanisms can guide the development of more effective treatment strategies for breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) patients.

## Mu and delta opioid receptor antagonists increase the expression of social conditioned place preference in early adolescent mice

**Abstract:**
RationaleSocial behaviors undergo dramatic changes during adolescence, enabling the development of adult social abilities. These changes are intricately linked to the development of the brain reward system and the activity of endogenous opioid signaling. However, the involvement of the opioid system in the development of social behaviors still raises more questions than answers.

ObjectivesHere, we investigated the role of the endogenous opioid system in the rewarding effects of social contact in early and late adolescent male mice.

MethodsSocial reward was assessed using the social conditioned place preference task in early adolescent (~34 days old) and late adolescent (~41 days old) male mice that received a single dose of the selective opioid receptor antagonists cyprodime (1 mg/kg, i.p.), naltrindole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or norbinaltorphimine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) before the preference posttest.

ResultsThe administration of cyprodime or naltrindole before the posttest significantly increased the preference for the social-conditioned context in early but not late adolescent mice. In contrast, pretreatment with norbinaltorphimine had no effect on context preference.

ConclusionsOur findings support a modified version of the state-dependent mu-opioid receptor model of social behavior, where the effects of opioid ligands are not reversed during development but rather weaken or disappear with age. Furthermore, the results indicate that interactions with siblings in early adolescent mice are motivated by negative reinforcement, whereas those in late adolescence are motivated by positive reinforcement.

**Abstract:**
The dopaminergic system has been extensively studied for its role in behavior in animals as well as human neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases. However, we still know little about how dopamine levels are tightly regulated in vivo. To identify novel regulators of dopamine, we utilized Drosophila melanogaster cuticle pigmentation as a readout, where dopamine is a precursor to melanin. We measured dopamine from genes known to be critical for cuticle pigmentation and performed an RNAi-based screen to identify new regulators of pigmentation. We found 153 potential pigmentation genes, which were enriched for conserved homologs and disease- associated genes as well as developmental signaling pathways and mitochondria-associated proteins. From 35 prioritized candidates, we found 10 caused significant reduction in head dopamine levels and one caused an increase. Two genes, clueless and mask (multiple ankyrin repeats single KH domain), upon knockdown, reduced dopamine levels in the brain. Further examination suggests that Mask regulates the transcription of the rate-limiting dopamine synthesis enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase, and its knockdown causes dopamine-dependent sleep phenotypes. In summary, by studying genes that affect cuticle pigmentation, a phenotype seemingly unrelated to the nervous system, we were able to identify several genes that affect dopamine metabolism as well as a novel regulator of behavior.

## Growth directions and stiffness across cell layers determine whether tissues stay smooth or buckle

**Abstract:**
From smooth shapes to buckles, nature exhibits organs of various shapes and forms. How cells grow to produce smooth shaped leaves and sepals remain unclear. Here, we show that growth along the longitudinal axis during early developmental stages and comparable stiffness across both epidermal layers of Arabidopsis sepals are essential for smoothness, as seen in the wild type. We identified a mutant (as2-7D) with ectopic expression of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) on the outer epidermis. Our analysis reveals that ectopic AS2 expression causes the outer epidermis of as2-7D sepals to buckle during early stages of sepal development. We show that buckling of the outer epidermis occurs due to conflicting cell growth directions and unequal tissue stiffness across the epidermal layers. Overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor Kip-related protein 1 (KRP1) in as2-7D restores sepal smoothness by aligning the growth directions of the outer epidermal cells along the longitudinal axis, while also increasing the overall stiffness of the outer epidermis. Furthermore, buckling is associated with the convergence of auxin efflux transporter protein PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) to generate outgrowth in the sepals at later stages, suggesting that buckling can initiate outgrowths. Our findings suggest that in addition to molecular cues influencing tissue mechanics, tissue mechanics can also modulate molecular signals, giving rise to well-defined shapes.

One-Sentence SummaryThe asymmetric leaves 2-7D mutant sepals buckle due to discoordination of growth between the two epidermal layers.

**Abstract:**
Glioblastoma is the deadliest brain cancer, characterized by large cellular diversity whose complexity and organizing principles are only starting to be uncovered. Both neurodevelopment-like and mesenchymal-like cell states have been described in glioblastoma1-8, with the latter being strongly implicated in malignancy and disease progression8-11. However, the nature of these mesenchymal-like cell states remains unresolved. Here, we performed deep single-cell RNA sequencing of rare glioblastoma cases where tissue could be sampled from tumor core to macroscopically normal cortex. We discovered that previously defined mesenchymal-like tumor cell states instead represented a wound response that was shared across both malignant and non-malignant cell types and was spatially confined to the tumor bulk. Using glioblastoma organoids, we showed that the wound response transcriptional state could be reversibly induced in vitro by hypoxia and human plasma. We used multiplex single-molecule spatial transcriptomics12 on a large patient cohort to show that the activation of wound response states was associated with hypoxia, and organized by distance to perivascular niches. Our findings help reconceptualize the cellular landscape of glioblastoma, wherein a reactive wound-response tissue state shared by all cells in the tumor bulk is superimposed on a fundamentally neurodevelopmental and glial tumor.

**Abstract:**
Individuals with Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB), a rare genetic skin disease characterised by loss of function mutations in the Laminin332 (Lam332), do not survive beyond their first birthday. Here we report that loss of Lam332 leads to absence of cholesterol lipid from the epidermis in vitro and in vivo. Using 3D skin equivalents, a JEB mouse model and JEB patient samples we confirmed changes in epidermal lipid synthesis, which was further explored using lipidomics. Cholesterol biosynthesis genes were increased with loss of Laminin-332 in vitro, however a decrease in immunofluorescence lipid staining was observed. Cholesterol transport in Laminin-332 knockdown keratinocytes was revealed to be disrupted, which in keratinocytes is dependent on the actomyosin network. In conclusion these findings suggest a role for the basement membrane protein Laminin-332 in lipid metabolism in the skin, and a broader role for epidermal homeostasis and barrier formation. Restoration of cholesterol transport in epidermal keratinocytes of JEB patients offers the potential to improve their skin barrier.

## Resting-state is not enough: alpha and mu rhythms change shape across development, but lack diagnostic sensitivity

**Abstract:**
In the human brain, the alpha rhythm in occipital cortex and the mu rhythm in sensorimotor cortex are among the most prominent rhythms, with both rhythms functionally implicated in gating modality-specific information. Separation of these rhythms is non-trivial due to the spatial mixing of these oscillations in sensor space. Using a computationally efficient processing pipeline requiring no manual data cleaning, we isolated alpha and/or mu rhythms from electroencephalography recordings performed on 1605 children aged 5-18. Using the extracted time series for each rhythm, we characterized the waveform shape on a cycle-by-cycle basis and examined whether and how the waveform shape differs across development. We demonstrate that alpha and mu rhythms both exhibit nonsinusoidal waveform shape that changes significantly across development, in addition to the known large changes in oscillatory frequency. This dataset also provided an opportunity to assess oscillatory measures for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found no differences in the resting-state features of these alpha-band rhythms for either ADHD or ASD in comparison to typically developing participants in this dataset. While waveform shape is ignored by traditional Fourier spectral analyses, these nonsinusoidal properties may be informative for building more constrained generative models for different types of alpha-band rhythms, yielding more specific insight into their generation.

**Abstract:**
Cortical activity results from the interplay between network-connected regions that integrate information and stimulus-driven processes originating from sensory motor networks responding to specific tasks. Separating the information due to each of these components has been challenging, and the relationship as measured by fMRI in each of these cases Rest (network) and Task (stimulus-driven) remains a significant outstanding question in the study of large-scale brain dynamics. In this study, we develop a network ordinary differential equation (ODE) model using advanced system identification tools to analyze fMRI data from both rest and task conditions. We demonstrate that task-specific ODEs are essentially a subset of rest-specific ODEs across four different tasks from the Human Connectome Project. By assuming that task activity is a relative complement of rest activity, our model significantly improves predictions of reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis, leading to a 9 % increase in explanatory power (R2) across the 14 subtasks tested. We have additionally shown that these results hold for predicting missing trials and accuracy on a per individual basis as well as classifying Tasks trajectories or resulting dynamic Task functional connectivity. Our findings establish the principle of the Active Cortex Model, which posits that the cortex is always active and that Rest State encompasses all processes, while certain subsets of processes get elevated to perform specific task computations. Thus, this study is an important milestone in the development of the fMRI equation - to causally link large-scale brain activity, brain structural connectivity, and behavioral variables within a single framework.

**Abstract:**
The ocean acts as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and resulting in substantial uptake of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. As biological processes in the oceans such as net primary production (NPP) contribute significantly to this sink, understanding how they will shift in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 is necessary to project future ocean carbon storage capacity. Macronutrient and micronutrient resource limitation within the oceans regulates NPP, and while some micronutrients such as zinc (Zn) are present at very low concentrations, their ability to limit NPP has remained unclear. Zn is a key micronutrient used by phytoplankton for a multitude of metabolic functions, yet there have been few observations of its influence on natural oceanic phytoplankton populations. In this study, we observed Zn limitation of growth in the natural phytoplankton community of Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, in addition to primary iron (Fe) limitation. Shipboard incubation experiments amended with Zn and Fe resulted in significantly higher chlorophyll a content and dissolved inorganic carbon drawdown compared to Fe addition alone. Zn and Fe stress response proteins detected in incubation and environmental biomass provided independent verification of algal co-stress for these micronutrients. We consider total biomass and low surface ocean pCO2 as potential drivers of environmental Zn stress. This study definitively establishes that Zn limitation can occur in the modern oceans, opening up new possibility space in our understanding of nutrient regulation of NPP through geologic time, and we consider the future of oceanic Zn limitation in the face of climate change.

**Abstract:**
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is typically treated empirically with vancomycin, with therapy later tailored based on susceptibility results. However, these tests occur before vancomycin exposure and do not account for adaptation during empiric treatment that can alter S. aureus' susceptibility to first-line drugs. To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU, impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes. Our findings suggest a probabilistic approach to antimicrobial therapy, advocating for rapid genomic diagnostics alongside susceptibility testing to better anticipate and respond to evolutionary changes.

**Abstract:**
Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have demonstrated robust induction of neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T cell activation, however CD8+ responses are variable, and the duration of immunity and protection against variants are limited. Here we repurposed our DNA origami vaccine nanotechnology, DoriVac, for targeting infectious viruses, namely SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and Ebola. The DNA origami nanoparticle, conjugated with infectious-disease-specific heptad repeat 2 (HR2) peptides, which act as highly conserved antigens, and CpG adjuvant at precise nanoscale spacing, induced neutralizing antibodies, Th1 CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in naive mice, with significant improvement over a bolus control. Pre-clinical studies using lymph-node-on-a-chip systems validated that DoriVac, when conjugated with antigenic peptides or proteins, induced promising cellular and humoral immune responses in human cells. Moreover, DoriVac bearing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein achieved immune responses comparable to current mRNA vaccine platforms while potentially reducing storage constraints. These results suggest that DoriVac holds potential as a versatile, modular vaccine platform, capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immunities, underscoring its potential utility in addressing future pandemics.

**Abstract:**
Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker Brainstem Thalamus Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking activity upon multi-whisker stimulation, resembling the stable response pattern observed in barrels. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions.

**Abstract:**
Insulator proteins act as a barrier of enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs). The main insulator protein in vertebrates is CTCF, a DNA-binding protein (DBP). However, other DBPs associated with insulators of EPIs are still unclear. Hence, we developed a systematic, comprehensive deep learning-based approach for identifying the DNA motifs of DBPs associated with insulators. We discovered 97 directional and minor nondirectional motifs in human fibroblast cells that corresponded to 23 DBPs related to insulator function, CTCF, and/or other types of chromosomal transcriptional regulation reported in previous studies. The estimated CTCF orientation bias was consistently proportional to CTCF orientation bias observed in chromatin interactions. The motifs were significantly more abundant at insulator sites separated by repressive and active regions, at boundary sites identified by chromatin interaction data, and at splice sites than other DBPs. For instance, we found that the key regulator MyoD-binding site is located at an insulator site near a gene involved in skeletal muscle differentiation and function. Finally, the insulator-pairing model explains that homologous and heterologous insulator-insulator pairing interactions are orientation-dependent. These findings contribute to elucidate novel transcriptional regulations.

**Abstract:**
Sequence-specific interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with genomic DNA underlie many cellular processes. High-throughput in vitro binding assays coupled with machine learning have made it possible to accurately define such molecular recognition in a biophysically interpretable way for hundreds of TFs across many structural families, providing new avenues for predicting how the sequence preference of a TF is impacted by disease-associated mutations in its DNA binding domain. We developed a method based on a reference-free tetrahedral representation of variation in base preference within a given structural family that can be used to accurately predict the effect of mutations in the protein sequence of the TF. Using the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain families as test cases, our results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately predicting the shifts ({Delta}{Delta}{Delta}G/RT) in binding free energy associated with TF mutants by leveraging high-quality DNA binding models for sets of homologous wild-type TFs.

**Abstract:**
KvS proteins are voltage-gated potassium channel subunits that form functional channels when assembled into heteromers with Kv2.1 (KCNB1) or Kv2.2 (KCNB2). Mammals have 10 KvS subunits: Kv5.1 (KCNF1), Kv6.1 (KCNG1), Kv6.2 (KCNG2), Kv6.3 (KCNG3), Kv6.4 (KCNG4), Kv8.1 (KCNV1), Kv8.2 (KCNV2), Kv9.1 (KCNS1), Kv9.2 (KCNS2), and Kv9.3 (KCNS3). Electrically excitable cells broadly express channels containing Kv2 subunits and most neurons have substantial Kv2 conductance. However, whether KvS subunits contribute to these conductances has not been clear, leaving the physiological roles of KvS subunits poorly understood. Here, we identify that two potent Kv2 inhibitors, used in combination, can distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers and Kv2-only channels. We find that Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, or Kv9-containing channels are resistant to the Kv2-selective pore-blocker RY785 yet remain sensitive to the Kv2-selective voltage sensor modulator guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX). Using these inhibitors in mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons, we find predominantly RY785-sensitive conductances consistent with channels composed entirely of Kv2 subunits. In contrast, RY785-resistant but GxTX-sensitive conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels predominate in mouse and human dorsal root ganglion neurons. These results establish an approach to pharmacologically distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers from Kv2-only channels, enabling investigation of the physiological roles of endogenous KvS subunits. These findings suggest that drugs which distinguish KvS subunits could modulate electrical activity of subsets of Kv2-expressing cell types.

**Abstract:**
Endolysins are highly evolved bacteriophage-encoded lytic enzymes produced to damage the bacterial cell wall for phage progeny release. They offer promising potential as highly specific lytic proteins with a low chance of bacterial resistance. The diversity in lysin sequences and domain organization can be staggering. In silico analysis of bacteriophage and prophage genomes can help identify endolysins exhibiting unique features and high antibacterial activity, hence feeding the pipeline of narrow-spectrum protein antibiotics. Mycobacteriophage lysis cassettes mostly have two lytic enzymes, LysinA and LysinB. The enzyme LysinA targets peptidoglycan in the cell wall and possesses a modular architecture. LysinB typically contains a single domain and acts upon the mycolyl ester linkages in mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (Payne et al., 2010). This study aimed to find novel LysinBs against Mycobacterium fortuitum. After a detailed in silico characterization of lysis cassettes from three M. fortuitum prophages, we chose to work on a LysinB (hereafter described as LysinB_MF) found in an incomplete prophage (phiE1336, 9.4 kb in strain E1336). LysinB_MF showed low sequence similarity with any other endolysins in the database and formed a separate clade on phylogenetic analysis. LysinB_MFs structure, extracted from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, demonstrated a modular architecture with two structurally distinct domains: a peptidoglycan-binding domain (PGBD) at the N-terminal and the characteristic alpha/beta hydrolase domain connected via a linker peptide. We found the alpha/beta hydrolase domain, which is the enzyme-active domain (EAD), contains the conserved Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad with a tunnel-like topology and forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The PGBD shows structural similarity to the cell-wall binding domain of an amidase from Clostridium acetobutylicum, hinting at its acquisition due to domain mobility. Our in silico electrostatic potential analysis suggested that PGBD might be essential to the enzyme activity. Based on our analysis, PGBD emerged as an integral constituent of enzymes with diverse functional properties and is predicted to be conserved cross-kingdom. Overall, this study highlights the importance of mining mycobacterial prophages as a novel endolysin source. It also provides unique insights into the diverse architecture of mycobacteriophage-encoded endolysins and the importance of functional domains for their catalytic activities.

**Abstract:**
Kinases are a diverse group of enzymes that use ATP to phosphorylate a variety of substrates. Protein kinases evolved in eukaryotes as important mediators of cell signalling that target specific amino acid side chains to modulate downstream protein function. Among them, the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) are a family of intracellular protein kinases that form signalling cascades responding to a number of stimuli, that control fundamental mechanisms such as proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and cell death. Signals propagate through consecutive kinases which eventually phosphorylate and activate a MAPK. Here, we show that the dual specificity threonine/tyrosine MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks or MEKs) are able to phosphorylate and activate their substrate MAPKs using ADP as well as ATP in vitro. As the pathways are involved in the stress response, we speculate that it would represent an advantage to be able to maintain signalling under conditions such as hypoxia, that occur under a number of cell stresses, including cancer and atherosclerosis, where the available pool of ATP could be depleted.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundFocused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging non-invasive technique for neuromodulation in the central nervous system (CNS). Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) leverages ultrafast Power Doppler Imaging (PDI) to detect changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV), which correlate well with neuronal activity and thus hold promise to monitor brain responses to FUS.

ObjectiveInvestigate the immediate and short-term effects of transcranial FUS neuromodulation in the brain with fUSI by characterizing hemodynamic responses.

MethodsWe designed a setup that aligns a FUS transducer with a linear array to allow immediate subsequent monitoring of the hemodynamic response with fUSI during and after FUS neuromodulation (FUS-fUSI) in lightly anesthetized mice. We investigated the effects of varying pressures and transducer positions on the hemodynamic responses.

ResultsWe found that higher FUS pressures increase the size of the activated brain area, as well as the magnitude of change in CBV and could show that sham sonications did not produce hemodynamic responses. Unilateral sonications resulted in bilateral hemodynamic changes with a significantly stronger response on the ipsilateral side. FUS neuromodulation in mice with a cranial window showed distinct activation patterns that were frequency-dependent and different from the activation patterns observed in the transcranial model.

ConclusionfUSI is hereby shown capable of transcranially monitoring online and short-term hemodynamic effects in the brain during and following FUS neuromodulation.

**Abstract:**
Most thyroid cancer deaths are attributed to a subset of poorly differentiated, metastatic tumors. To improve treatment options for these aggressive thyroid cancers, we developed a novel thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR)-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell therapy, which demonstrated antigen-specific activation and antitumor efficacy against TSHR-overexpressing cell lines in vitro and in vivo. However, de-differentiated thyroid cancers downregulate TSHR. We therefore developed a potent treatment strategy by combining our novel TSHR-CART cells with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, which redifferentiate thyroid tumors and upregulate TSHR expression. In patient-derived anaplastic thyroid cancer xenografts, combination therapy of TSHR-CART cells and MAPK inhibitors led to increased TSHR expression on the tumor tissue and significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy and prolonged survival compared to TSHR-CART monotherapy.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEPoor target selection and antigen escape limit CART cell efficacy in solid tumors. We developed TSHR-CART cells to treat differentiated thyroid cancers but observed TSHR downregulation in dedifferentiated thyroid cancers. We found that MAPK inhibitors restored TSHR expression and sensitized these cancers to TSHR-CART cell therapy.

**Abstract:**
Task errors are used to learn and refine motor skills. We investigated how task assistance influences learned neural representations using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), which map neural activity into movement via a decoder. We analyzed motor cortex activity as monkeys practiced BCI with a decoder that adapted to improve or maintain performance over days. Over time, task-relevant information became concentrated in fewer neurons, unlike with fixed decoders. At the population level, task information also became largely confined to a few neural modes that accounted for an unexpectedly small fraction of the population variance. A neural network model suggests the adaptive decoders directly contribute to forming these more compact neural representations. Our findings show that assistive decoders manipulate error information used for long-term learning computations like credit assignment, which informs our understanding of motor learning and has implications for designing real-world BCIs.

**Abstract:**
Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) are well validated antimicrobial targets, but the prevalence of {beta}-lactamase driven resistance and, more rarely, target-based mutations, necessitates new classes of PBP-targeting drugs. Here we describe the discovery and optimisation of novel, bicyclic peptide (Bicycle(R)) inhibitors of E. coli PBP3 (EcPBP3) using a proprietary phage display platform, and their conjugation to linear antimicrobial peptides to confer outer membrane permeation. These molecules exhibited high-affinity binding to E. coli PBP3 and a viable spectrum of killing activity against clinically relevant species of the Enterobacterales. X-ray crystallography was used to explore the mode of binding to PBP3, enabling increased target affinity and improvement of in vitro stability. These compounds bind to the transpeptidase active site cleft of PBP3 and represent a novel non-{beta}-lactam chemical class of high affinity, non-covalent penicillin binding protein inhibitors.

## SMAdd-seq: Probing chromatin accessibility with small molecule DNA intercalation and nanopore sequencing

**Abstract:**
Studies of in vivo chromatin organization have relied on the accessibility of the underlying DNA to nucleases or methyltransferases, which is limited by their requirement for purified nuclei and enzymatic treatment. Here, we introduce a nanopore-based sequencing technique called Small-Molecule Adduct sequencing (SMAdd-seq), where we profile chromatin accessibility by treating nuclei or intact cells with a small molecule, angelicin. Angelicin reacts with thymine bases in linker DNA not bound to core nucleosomes after UV light exposure, thereby labeling accessible DNA regions. By applying SMAdd-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that angelicin-modified DNA can be detected by its distinct nanopore current signals. To systematically identify angelicin modifications and analyze chromatin structure, we developed a neural network model, NEural network for mapping MOdifications in nanopore long-reads (NEMO). NEMO accurately called expected nucleosome occupancy patterns near transcription start sites at both bulk and single-molecule levels. We observe heterogeneity in chromatin structure and identify clusters of single-molecule reads with varying configurations at specific yeast loci. Furthermore, SMAdd-seq performs equivalently on purified yeast nuclei and intact cells, indicating the promise of this method for in vivo chromatin labeling on long single molecules to measure native chromatin dynamics and heterogeneity.

**Abstract:**
Understanding how the eyes, head, and hands coordinate in natural contexts is a critical challenge in visuomotor coordination research, often constrained by sedentary or restricted tasks and cued actions. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment where participants self-generated pick-and-place actions in a virtual environment, recording concurrent gaze and body movements. Subjects exhibited intricate translation and rotation movements of the eyes, head, and hands during the task. We employed time-dependent principal component analysis to study the relationship between the movements of the eyes, head, and hands relative to action onset. We reduced the overall dimensionality into 2D representations, capturing up to 65\% of the movement variance just in time with the actions. Our analysis revealed the eyes synchronized with the head and hands close to action onset, with variations in coupling observed in horizontal and vertical planes, indicating distinct mechanisms for coordination in the brain. Crucially, the head and hands remained tightly coupled throughout the observation period, suggesting a shared neural code driving these effectors. Notably, the low-dimensional representations of the eye-head-hand movement vectors showed maximum predictive accuracy of the upcoming action location ~200 ms before onset, highlighting just-in-time coordination among the three effectors. Furthermore, predictive accuracy was significantly influenced by the location of the upcoming action. Our study emphasizes differential visuomotor control shaped by task structure, providing insights into the dynamic interplay of eye, head, and hand movements during natural behavior.

**Abstract:**
Neural processing of sensory information takes time. Consequently, to estimate the current state of the world, the brain must rely on predictive processes - for example, extrapolating the motion of a ball to determine its probable present position. Some evidence implicates early (pre-cortical) processing in extrapolation, but it remains unclear whether extrapolation continues during later-stage (cortical) processing, where further delays accumulate. Moreover, the majority of such evidence relies on invasive neurophysiological techniques in animals, with accurate characterisation of extrapolation effects in the human brain currently lacking. Here, we address these issues by demonstrating how precise probabilistic maps can be constructed from human EEG recordings. Participants (N = 18, 2 sessions) viewed a stimulus moving along a circular trajectory while EEG was recorded. Using LDA classification, we extracted maps of stimulus location over time and found evidence of a forwards temporal shift occurring across temporally distinct processing stages. This accelerated emergence of position representations indicates extrapolation occurring at multiple stages of processing, with representations progressively shifted closer to real-time. We further show evidence of representational overshoot during early-stage processing following unexpected changes to an objects trajectory, and demonstrate that the observed dynamics can emerge without supervision in a simulated neural network via spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

**Abstract:**
Improvements in single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) assays have enabled detailed characterization of somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) at the single-cell level. Yet, current computational methods are mostly designed for detecting chromosome-scale changes in cancer samples with low sequencing coverage. Here, we introduce HiScanner (High-resolution Single-Cell Allelic copy Number callER), which combines read depth, B-allele frequency, and haplotype phasing to identify CNAs with high resolution. In simulated data, HiScanner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various CNA types and sizes. When applied to high-coverage scWGS data from 65 cells across 11 neurotypical human brains, HiScanner shows a superior ability to detect smaller CNAs, uncovering distinct CNA patterns between neurons and oligodendrocytes. We also generated low-coverage scWGS data from 179 cells sampled from the same meningioma patient at two time points. For this serial dataset, integration of CNAs with point mutations revealed evolutionary trajectories of tumor cells. These findings show that HiScanner enables accurate characterization of frequency, clonality, and distribution of CNAs at the single-cell level in both non-neoplastic and neoplastic cells.

**Abstract:**
The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural computations to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviors and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep-learning behavioral analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective-motivational behaviors without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic mu-opioid receptor promoter to drive chemogenetic inhibition in opioid-responsive ACC neurons. This targeted neuromodulation recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain. This opioid-mimetic gene therapy offers a new strategy for precision pain management by targeting a key nociceptive cortical circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

**Abstract:**
Bioluminescence is the production of visible light by living organisms. It occurs through the oxidation of a luciferin substrate catalysed by luciferase enzymes. Auxiliary proteins, such as fluorescent proteins and luciferin-binding proteins, can modify the light emitted wavelength or stabilize reactive luciferin molecules, respectively. Additionally, calcium ions are crucial for the luminescence across various species. Despite the large phylogenetic distribution of bioluminescent organisms, only a few systems have been comprehensively studied. Notably, cnidarian species of the Renilla genus utilize a coelenterazine-dependent luciferase, a calcium-dependent coelenterazine-binding protein and a green fluorescent protein. We investigated the bioluminescence of three sea pen species: Pennatula phosphorea, Anthoptilum murrayi and Funiculina quadrangularis (Pennatuloidea, Anthozoa). Their light-emission spectra reveal peaks at 510, 513 and 485 nm, respectively. A coelenterazine-based reaction was demonstrated in all three species. Using transcriptome analyses, we identified predicted transcripts coding for luciferases, green fluorescent proteins and coelenterazine-binding proteins for P. phosphorea and A. murrayi. Immunodetection confirmed the expression of luciferase in P. phosphorea and F. quadrangularis. We also expressed recombinant luciferase of A. murrayi, confirming its activity. We highlighted the role of calcium ions in bioluminescence, possibly associated with the mechanism of substrate release at the level of coelenterazine-binding proteins. The study proposes a model for anthozoan bioluminescence, offering new avenues for future ecological and functional research on these luminous organisms.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundPriming plant immunity offers a powerful and sustainable strategy for crop protection, enabling plants to respond faster and more efficiently to threats. This increased readiness is driven by transcriptional memory--molecular mechanisms that store and recall stress responses, including protein accumulation, transcription factor activity, and epigenetic modifications. However, the interplay among transcriptional stress memory, its stability, and its broader impact on plant resistance remain poorly understood.

ResultsHere, we reveal a tight link between transcriptional memory and defense priming in Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to repeated acoustic stimulations. Using a combination of experiments and computational modeling, we show that enhanced resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum after three stimulations arises from three key mechanisms: (1) preemptive activation of defense pathways in noninoculated plants, (2) increased diversification of defense-related genes, and (3) gene priming. This heightened defense state is sustained by transcriptional stress memory across thousands of genes, which is likely orchestrated by transcription factor cascades.

Challenging the conventional view that priming involves stepwise activation of distinct pathways, our findings suggest that priming instead results from the simultaneous modulation of a broad spectrum of defense pathways. This built-in redundancy enhances resilience, shielding primed plants from the genetic variability-driven resistance loss observed in naive plants. However, this same redundancy imposes strict limits on further enhancing the resistance. More frequent acoustic stimulations did not amplify the protective effect, and transcriptional memory faded within 1.5 days after stimulation ceased.

ConclusionsBy integrating experimental and computational approaches, we present a genome-scale quantitative model of stress-induced gene regulation. Our results highlight the trade-offs inherent in transcriptional memory-driven priming, revealing both its potential and its limitations in optimizing plant immunity.

**Abstract:**
In the canonical interpretation of dopaminergic neuron activity during Pavlovian conditioning, initially cell firing is triggered by unexpected rewards. Upon learning, activation instead follows the reward-predictive conditioned stimulus, and when expected rewards are withheld, firing is inhibited. However, little is known about dopaminergic neuron activity during the actual learning process in operant tasks. Here, we recorded optogenetically identified dopaminergic neurons of ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice training in multiple, successive operant sensory discrimination tasks. A delay between nose-poke choices and trial outcome signals (for reward or punishment) probed for instructional or predictive activity. During training, but prior to criterion performance, firing increased after correct, but not incorrect choices, but prior to outcome signals. Thus, the neurons predicted whether choices would be rewarded, despite the animals subthreshold behavioral performance. Surprisingly, these neurons also fired after reward delivery, as if the rewards had been unexpected according to the canonical view, but activity was inhibited after punishment signals, as if the reward had been expected after all. These inconsistencies suggest revision of theoretical formulations of dopaminergic neuronal activity to embody multiple roles in temporal difference learning and actor-critic models. Furthermore, on training trials when these neurons predicted that a given choice was correct and would be rewarded, surprisingly, the mice adhered to other non-rewarded and untrained task strategies (e.g., alternation). The DA neurons reward prediction activity could serve as critic signals for the choices just made. This consistent with the notion that the brain must reconcile multiple Bayesian belief representations during learning.

Significance statementThe canonical view of dopaminergic function based on classical conditioning studies evokes reward-prediction error (RPE) signaling. Here, in mice performing a series of novel operant tasks with a delay between behavioral responses and reward/punishment signals, some neurons began firing after correct (but not incorrect) responses, but prior to the trial outcome (reward/punishment) signal. Nevertheless, the animals performed at chance levels, employing behavioral strategies other than the one signaled by the neurons. Furthermore, these same neurons showed canonical RPE responses, increased firing after reward signals (interpreted as the reward being unexpected) and firing rate decreases punishment (interpreted as a reward having been expected). These findings indicate that dopaminergic neurons can participate in diverse functions underlying different behavioral strategies for learning.

**Abstract:**
It is vital to understand the genomic basis of differences in ecologically important traits if we are to understand the impact of global change on biodiversity and enhance our ability for targeted intervention. This study explores the potential of a novel genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach for identifying loci underlying quantitative polygenic traits in natural populations, based on phenotypic population means and genome-wide allele frequency data as obtained e.g. by PoolSeq approaches. Extensive population genetic forward simulations demonstrate that the approach is generally effective for oligogenic and moderately polygenic traits and relatively insensitive to low heritability. However, applicability is limited for highly polygenic architectures and pronounced population structure. The required sample size is moderate with very good results being obtained already for a few dozen populations scored. When combined with machine learning for feature selection, the method performs very well in predicting population means. The data efficiency of the method, particularly when using pooled sequencing and bulk phenotyping, makes GWAS studies more accessible for research in biodiversity genomics. Moreover, in a direct comparison to individual based GWAS, the proposed method performed constistently better with regard to the number of true positive loci identified and prediction accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the promise of popGWAS for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in natural populations.

**Abstract:**
Hearing loss is a pervasive global health challenge with profound impacts on communication, cognitive function, and quality of life. Recent studies have established age-related hearing loss as a significant risk factor for dementia, highlighting the importance of hearing loss research. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), which are electrophysiological recordings of synchronized neural activity from the auditory nerve and brainstem, serve as in vivo readouts for sensory hair cell, synaptic integrity, hearing sensitivity, and other key features of auditory pathway functionality, making them highly valuable for both basic neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics. Despite their utility, traditional ABR analyses rely heavily on subjective manual interpretation, leading to considerable variability and limiting reproducibility across studies. Here, we introduce Auditory Brainstem Response Analyzer (ABRA), a novel open-source graphical user interface powered by deep learning, which automates and standardizes ABR waveform analysis. ABRA employs convolutional neural networks trained on diverse datasets collected from multiple experimental settings, achieving rapid and unbiased extraction of key ABR metrics, including peak amplitude, latency, and auditory threshold estimates. We demonstrate that ABRAs deep learning models provide performance comparable to expert human annotators while dramatically reducing analysis time and enhancing reproducibility across datasets from different laboratories. By bridging hearing research, sensory neuroscience, and advanced computational techniques, ABRA facilitates broader interdisciplinary insights into auditory function. An online version of the tool is available for use at no cost at https://abra.ucsd.edu.

**Abstract:**
Humans are the only species with the ability to convey an unbounded number of novel thoughts by combining words into sentences. This process is guided by complex semantic and abstract syntactic representations. Despite their centrality to human cognition, the neural mechanisms underlying these systems remain obscured by inherent limitations of non-invasive brain measures and a near total focus on comprehension paradigms. Here, we address these limitations with high-resolution neurosurgical recordings (electrocorticography) and a controlled sentence production experiment. We uncover distinct cortical networks encoding word-level, semantic, and syntactic information. These networks are broadly distributed across traditional language areas, but with focal sensitivity to syntactic structure in middle and inferior frontal gyri. In contrast to previous findings from comprehension studies, these networks are largely non-overlapping, each specialized for just one of the three linguistic constructs we investigate. Most strikingly, our data reveal an unexpected property of higher-order linguistic information: it is encoded independent of neural activity levels. We propose that this "magnitude-independent coding" scheme represents a novel mechanism for encoding information, reserved for higher-order cognition more broadly.

**Abstract:**
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Previous studies have reported more than 50 CME accessory proteins; however, the mechanism driving the invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) remains elusive. We show by quantitative live cell imaging that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCDC32, a poorly characterized endocytic accessory protein, leads to the accumulation of unstable flat clathrin assemblies. CCDC32 interacts with the -appendage domain (AD) of AP2 in vitro and with full length AP2 complexes in cells. Deletion of aa78-98 in CCDC32, corresponding to a predicted -helix, abrogates AP2 binding and CCDC32s early function in CME. Furthermore, clinically observed nonsense mutations in CCDC32, which result in C-terminal truncations that lack aa78-98, are linked to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome (CFNDS). Overall, our data demonstrate the function of a novel endocytic accessory protein, CCDC32, in regulating CCP stabilization and invagination, critical early stages of CME.

SummaryWe show that CCDC32, a poorly studied and functionally ambiguous protein, binds to AP2 and regulates CCP stabilization and invagination. Clinically observed mutations in CCDC32 lose their ability to interact with AP2 likely contributing to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome.

**Abstract:**
Molecular convergence, where specific non-synonymous changes in protein-coding genes lead to identical amino acid substitutions across multiple lineages, provides strong evidence of adaptive evolution. Detecting this signal across diverse taxa can reveal broad evolutionary mechanisms that may not be apparent when studying individual lineages. In this study, we search for convergent substitutions in the most speciose group of vertebrates, teleost fishes. Using an unsupervised approach, we detected convergence in 89 protein-coding genes across 143 chromosomal-level genomes. To assess their functional implications, we integrate data on protein properties, gene expression across species and tissues, single-cell RNA sequencing of zebrafish embryonic development, and gene perturbation experiments in zebrafish. The convergent genes were associated with diverse processes including embryonic development, tissue morphogenesis, metabolism, and responses to hormones and heat stress. The convergent substitutions altered amino acid properties, with some occurring at functionally critical sites. Notably, only one-third of these genes were tissue-specific, while the majority were expressed across multiple tissues and cell types. Genetic perturbation data further showed that the convergent genes can affect multiple structures across diverse tissues. These results highlight the pleiotropic nature of the convergent genes. Using an evolutionary modeling approach, we show that adaptive variation tends to accumulate in genes with intermediate pleiotropy, enabling organisms to overcome selective pressures during ecological shifts. Although traditionally considered a source of constraint, we argue that adaptation via genes with intermediate pleiotropy might be particularly advantageous following periods of ecological shifts, and can potentially lead to the evolution of convergent phenotypes.

**Abstract:**
Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures supports long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and home literacy environment, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to second-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop early in infancy but undergo further refinement between birth and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.

## Synergistic reinforcement learning by cooperation of the cerebellum and basal ganglia

**Abstract:**
The cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia are essential for flexible learning in mammals. Although traditionally thought to operate under different learning rules, recent evidence suggests that both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum may employ reinforcement learning mechanisms. This raises the question of how these structures coordinate when a common reward prediction error mechanism is active. To address this issue, we first examined output signals from the basal ganglia and cerebellum following the activity of the cerebral cortex. We recorded single-neuron activity from the output regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia - the cerebellar nuclei (CN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) - in both male and female ChR2 transgenic rats. Neurons in the CN and SNr exhibited distinct temporal response patterns; notably, the fast excitatory response in the CN, driven by mossy fiber input, was synchronized with the inhibitory response in the SNr, mediated via the direct pathway. Using these experimental findings together with connectome data, we developed both a semi-realistic spiking network model and a reservoir-based reinforcement learning model. In the latter model, successful learning depended on synaptic plasticity in both the cerebellum and basal ganglia with a temporal precision on the order of 10 ms. Furthermore, cortical {beta}-oscillations enhanced learning and optimal reinforcement learning occurred when the output of cerebellar and basal ganglia signal phase-locked at the frequency of cortical oscillation. Taken together, our results suggest that the coordinated output of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, driven by tightly tuned cortical input, underlies brain-wide synergistic reinforcement learning.

Significance StatementThe cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia support learning. Recent research suggests that both the basal ganglia and cerebellum use a similar learning process called reinforcement learning, which involves predicting rewards. To understand how these brain regions work together, we recorded brain activity in rats while photo-stimulating the cerebral cortex. We found that two types of responses in the cerebellum and basal ganglia were synchronized, which might help activate the cerebral cortex. A computer model showed that precise timing of signals from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia is important for learning. This timing was important only when the cerebral cortex worked in a specific frequency range. Our findings suggest that coordinated brain activity enhances learning.

**Abstract:**
De novo protein design represents a fundamental pursuit in protein engineering, yet current deep learning approaches remain constrained by their narrow design scope. Here we present Pinal, a large-scale frontier framework comprising 16 billion parameters and trained on 1.7 billion protein-text pairs, that bridges natural language understanding with protein design space, translating human design intent into novel protein sequences. Instead of a straightforward end-to-end textto-sequence generation, Pinal implements a two-stage process: first generating protein structures based on language instructions, then designing sequences conditioned on both the generated structure and the language input. This strategy effectively constrains the search space by operating in the more tractable structural domain. Through comprehensive computational evaluation, we demonstrate that Pinal achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches, including the concurrent work ESM3, while exhibiting robust generalization to novel protein structures beyond the PDB database. Lastly, we experimentally validated that four out of the eight de novo-designed alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), guided by natural language inputs, exhibited functional activity.

**Abstract:**
High-resolution energetic information about protein conformational ensembles is essential for understanding protein function, yet remains challenging to obtain. We present PIGEON-FEATHER, a method for calculating ensemble free energies of opening ({Delta}Gop) at single- or near-single-amino acid resolution for proteins of all sizes from hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry (HX/MS) data. PIGEON-FEATHER disambiguates and reconstructs all experimentally measured HX/MS isotopic mass envelopes using a Bayesian Monte Carlo sampling approach. We applied PIGEON-FEATHER to reveal how E. coli and human dihydrofolate reductases (ecDHFR, hDHFR) have evolved distinct ensembles. We show how two competitive inhibitors bind these orthologs differently, solving the longstanding mystery of why both therapeutic molecules inhibit hDHFR, but only one inhibits ecDHFR. Extending PIGEON-FEATHER to a large protein-DNA complex, we mapped ligand-induced ensemble reweighting in the E. coli lac repressor to describe the functional switching mechanism crucial for transcriptional regulation.

**Abstract:**
Sensory stimulation of the brain reverberates in its recurrent neural networks. However, current computational models of brain activity do not separate immediate sensory responses from this intrinsic dynamic. We apply a vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX), combining the concepts of "functional connectivity" and "encoding models", to intracranial recordings in humans. This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic. We find that the intrinsic dynamic enhances and prolongs the neural responses to scene cuts, eye movements, and sounds. Failing to account for these extrinsic inputs, leads to spurious recurrent connections that govern the intrinsic dynamic. We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching. The model shows that an external stimulus can reduce intrinsic noise. It also shows that sensory areas have mostly outward, whereas higher-order brain areas mostly incoming connections. We conclude that the response to an external audiovisual stimulus can largely be attributed to the intrinsic dynamic of the brain, already observed during rest.

**Abstract:**
Fasciolosis is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. It is a serious public health and veterinary concern, with significant consequences for both human and livestock populations. An abattoir-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January to September 2023 at Gondar ELFORA Abattoir, Ethiopia, to assess hematobiochemical alterations and pathological lesions induced by fasciolosis in slaughtered cattle. The study involved one hundred apparently healthy male local breed cattle, evenly split into fifty infected and fifty non-infected individuals, using a purposive sampling technique. Findings showed lower mean values for hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), total erythrocyte count (TEC), lymphocytes, monocytes, total protein, albumin, and glucose. Conversely, they had higher mean values for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total leukocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, eosinophils, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Basophil levels were similar in both groups. Liver alterations observed included hepatomegaly with rounded edges and the presence of juvenile flukes in the cut section of the parenchyma. In chronic cases, the liver appeared smaller, with a firm consistency, a corrugated capsule, and dilated bile ducts containing twisted flukes. Microscopically, during the acute phase, there was infiltration of eosinophils, hemosiderin pigmentation, and congestion around the central vein and sinusoids. In contrast, chronic cases exhibited fibrosis, proliferation of bile ducts, and metaplasia of columnar to cuboidal epithelial cells. The results of hematobiochemical alterations were consistent with gross and microscopic findings, indicating a significant impact on liver physiology and histology, leading to substantial losses in meat and milk production.

**Abstract:**
Expansion of a disease-specific tandem repeat is responsible for >45 Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs). The mismatch repair protein PMS2 is a modifier of somatic expansion and disease severity in Huntingtons disease (HD), a RED resulting from a CAG-repeat expansion. However, PMS2 shows different effects in different RED models, protecting against expansion in some and promoting it in others. To better understand this difference, we carried out a systematic study of the loss of PMS2 in mouse models of HD and the fragile X-related disorders (FXDs), a group of REDs resulting from a CGG-repeat expansion. In both models, loss of one Pms2 allele resulted in more expansions, while loss of both alleles resulted in more expansion in some organs but less in others. Thus, rather than reflecting different expansion mechanisms in different diseases, the previously reported differences in different model systems likely reflects the ability of PMS2 to promote expansion in some cellular contexts and to protect against it in others. In mouse embryonic stem cells containing both sets of repeats where PMS2 was expressed under the control of a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible promoter, low DOX concentrations produced a dose-dependent increase in expansions of both repeats, an effect that was dependent on the PMS2 nuclease domain, while higher DOX levels resulted in a decrease in expansions. Our findings have implications both for the mechanism of expansion and for therapeutic approaches to treat these diseases by reducing somatic expansion.

Significance statementExpansion of a disease-specific microsatellite is responsible for >45 Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs). The mismatch repair factor PMS2 has been identified as a genetic modifier of somatic expansion and disease severity in Huntingtons disease (HD). However, loss of PMS2 has different effects in different REDs models. Using mouse and cell models of the fragile X-related disorders and HD, we show that PMS2 has both pro-mutagenic and anti-mutagenic effects in both models depending on the cell type and that an intact nuclease domain is required for its ability to promote expansion. These findings support the idea that the REDs all share a common expansion mechanism and suggests a model for repeat expansion consistent with a dual role for PMS2 in this process.

**Abstract:**
Computational prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding cell biology and drug development, offering a promising alternative to costly and time-consuming experimental methods. While the original GenPPi software represented an advance in ab initio PPI network prediction from bacterial genomes, its reliance on high sequence similarity limited it. In this work, we introduce the GenPPi 1.5 and enhance prediction capabilities. We incorporated a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, trained on 60 biophysical features derived from amino acid propensity indices, to overcome the previous limitation by classifying protein similarity even in low sequence identity scenarios (targeting > 65% identity). Furthermore, to address the computational complexity arising from the increased number of potential interactions generated by the RF model, especially within extensive conserved phylogenetic profiles, we developed and integrated the Reduced Interaction Sampling (RIS) algorithm. RIS stochastically samples interactions within these extensive profiles, optimizing performance for complete genome analysis. Our multifaceted methodology included integrating RF for efficient similarity classification and implementing RIS to reduce the computational burden. We evaluated the effectiveness through extensive simulations across different configurations (operational modes, Top N selected nodes, number of analyzed genomes). We rigorously assessed the network stability and structural integrity using topological metrics and statistical tests. Results demonstrate that RF integration significantly broadens GenPPi's predictive power. Application to the Buchnera aphidicola genome revealed an overlap of up to 62% with interactions documented in the STRING database, validating prediction accuracy. Analysis of the RIS algorithm showed that while introducing some randomness, critical node identification remains robust, particularly for Top N values [&ge;] 100, indicating that the edge reduction does not significantly compromise network integrity. In conclusion, combining Machine Learning and RIS represents a significant advancement. GenPPi 1.5 overcomes the high-similarity dependency while efficiently handling complex genomes, providing a robust and scalable alignment-free solution for PPI prediction. GenPPi is available at https://genppi.facom.ufu.br/ and on GitHub: https://github.com/santosardr/genppi and allows users to train custom models for specific genomic contexts.

**Abstract:**
Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is a promising means to combat drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Infection by phage can select for mutations in bacterial populations that confer resistance against phage infection. However, resistance against phage can yield evolutionary trade-offs of biomedical relevance. Here we report the discovery that infection by certain staphylococcal phages sensitizes different strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to {beta}-lactams, a class of antibiotics against which MRSA is typically resistant. MRSA cells that survive infection by these phages display significant reductions in minimal inhibitory concentration against different {beta}-lactams compared to uninfected bacteria. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that these evolved MRSA strains possess highly modulated transcriptional profiles, where numerous genes involved in S. aureus virulence were downregulated. Phage-treated MRSA exhibited attenuated virulence phenotypes in the form of reduced hemolysis and clumping. Despite sharing similar phenotypes, whole-sequencing analysis revealed that the different MRSA strains evolved unique genetic profiles during infection. These results suggest complex evolutionary trajectories in MRSA during phage predation and open up new possibilities to reduce drug resistance and virulence in MRSA infections.

**Abstract:**
Intravital microscopy (IVM) enables live imaging of animals at single-cell resolution, offering essential insights into cancer progression. This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological and dynamic single cell features. BEHAV3D-TP is user-friendly and integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data without advanced computational expertise. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.

**Abstract:**
Caveolin is a monotopic integral membrane protein, widely expressed in metazoa and responsible for constructing enigmatic membrane invaginations known as caveolae. Recently, the high-resolution structure of a purified human caveolin assembly, the CAV1-8S complex, revealed a unique organization of 11 protomers arranged in a tightly packed, radially symmetric spiral disc. One face and the outer rim of this disc are hydrophobic, suggesting that the complex incorporates into membranes by displacing hundreds of lipids from one leaflet. The feasibility of this unique molecular architecture and its biophysical and functional consequences are currently unknown. Using Langmuir film balance measurements, we find that CAV1-8S is highly surface active, intercalating into lipid monolayers of various compositions. CAV1-8S can also incorporate into preformed bilayers, but only upon removal of phospholipids from the outer-facing leaflet. Atomistic and coarse-grained simulations of biomimetic bilayers support this  leaflet replacement model and also reveal that CAV1-8S accumulates 40-70 cholesterol molecules into a disordered monolayer between the complex and its distal lipid leaflet. We find that CAV1-8S preferentially associates with positively curved membrane surfaces due to its influence on the conformations of distal leaflet lipids, and that these effects laterally sort lipids. Large-scale simulations of multiple caveolin assemblies confirmed their association with large, positively curved membrane morphologies consistent with the shape of caveolae. Further, association with curved membranes regulates the exposure of caveolin residues implicated in protein-protein interactions. Altogether, the unique structure of CAV1-8S imparts unusual modes of membrane interaction with implications for membrane organization, morphology, and physiology.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECaveolae are membrane invaginations heavily implicated in cellular physiology and disease; however, how their unique shape and function are produced remains enigmatic. Here, following on recent characterization of the unusual structure of the CAV1-8S oligomer, we examine the molecular details of its interactions with its surrounding lipid membrane using simulations and reconstitution experiments. We describe a novel mode of membrane interaction-which we term  leaflet replacement-for the CAV1-8S complex that has not previously been observed for any other protein. The biophysical consequences of this unique molecular organization provide mechanistic insights into the functions and organization of caveolae in cells.

**Abstract:**
We propose a learning architecture that allows symbolic control and guidance
in reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. We introduce SymDQN, a
novel modular approach that augments the existing Dueling Deep Q-Networks
(DuelDQN) architecture with modules based on the neuro-symbolic framework of
Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs). The modules guide action policy learning and
allow reinforcement learning agents to display behaviour consistent with
reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed
on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a
5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated
with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal
behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape
recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly
improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent.
The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities
of combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.

**Abstract:**
Mycobacterium tuberculosis when phagocytosed by macrophages is not cleared completely and many of the bacteria remain in phagosomes indefinitely. In this study we considered abnormal retention of filamentous actin on early phagosomes contributing to defective phagosome acidification. The actin depolymerizing protein cofilin1 was found downregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Also, phosphocofilin1, the inactive form of cofilin1, which leads to retention of filamentous actin, and the total filamentous actin itself were found upregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Over expression of constitutively active cofilin1 in macrophages was found to decrease the level of filamentous actin and increase phagosome acidification when infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. The anticancer drug sorafenib which activates cofilin1 in PI3K dependent manner was also found to decrease the filamentous actin level and increase phagosome acidification. Cofilin1, known to be positively regulated by superoxide was found to be downregulated by ESAT-6 of M. tuberculosis where the latter is known to reduce ROS in macrophages. Ectopic expression of ESAT-6 in macrophages was found to downregulate cofilin1, increase filamentous actin and to transform the macrophages more spindle shaped. ESAT-6 was also found to decrease phagosome acidification in macrophages infected with an avirulent M. tuberculosis strain. Finally, this study proposes a role for the amino acid methionine in resisting ROS by creating M93 mutants of ESAT-6.

## Ancient Trans-Species Polymorphism at the Major Histocompatibility Complex in Primates

**Abstract:**
Classical genes within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are responsible for peptide presentation to T cells, thus playing a central role in immune defense against pathogens. These genes are subject to strong selective pressures including both balancing and directional selection, resulting in exceptional genetic diversity--thousands of alleles per gene in humans. Moreover, some allelic lineages appear to be shared between primate species, a phenomenon known as trans-species polymorphism (TSP) or incomplete lineage sorting, which is rare in the genome overall. However, despite the clinical and evolutionary importance of MHC diversity, we currently lack a full picture of primate MHC evolution. In particular, we do not know to what extent genes and allelic lineages are retained across speciation events. To start addressing this gap, we explore variation across genes and species in our companion paper (Fortier and Pritchard, 2025) and here we explore variation within individual genes. We used Bayesian phylogenetic methods to determine the extent of TSP at 17 MHC genes, including classical and non-classical Class I and Class II genes. We find strong support for ancient TSP in 7 of 10 classical genes, including--remarkably--between humans and old-world monkeys in MHC-DQB1. In addition to the long-term persistence of ancient lineages, we additionally observe rapid evolution at nucleotides encoding the proteins' peptide-binding domains. The most rapidly-evolving amino acid positions are extremely enriched for autoimmune and infectious disease associations. Together, these results suggest complex selective forces--arising from differential peptide binding--that drive short-term allelic turnover within lineages while also maintaining deeply divergent lineages for at least 31 million years in some cases.

**Abstract:**
Sensorimotor computations for learning and behavior rely on precise patterns of synaptic connectivity. Yet, we typically lack the synaptic wiring diagrams for long-range connections between sensory and motor circuits in the brain. Here we provide the synaptic wiring diagram for sensorimotor circuits involved in learning and production of male zebra finch song, a natural and ethologically relevant behavior. We examined the functional synaptic connectivity from the 4 main sensory afferent pathways onto the 3 known classes of projection neurons of the song premotor cortical region HVC. Recordings from hundreds of identified projection neurons reveal rules for monosynaptic connectivity and the existence of polysynaptic ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in HVC. Circuit tracing further identifies novel connections between HVCs presynaptic partners. Our results indicate a modular organization of ensemble-like networks for integrating long-range input with local circuits, providing important context for information flow and computations for learned vocal behavior.

**Abstract:**
The immediate social context critically modulates drug consumption. The presence of an unfamiliar conspecific, naive to the drug, at the time of consumption reduces cocaine self-administration in male rats during short-access sessions, as well as drug intake in human cocaine users. The subthalamic nucleus (STN), a brain structure involved in cocaine addiction and limbic processes, has been proposed to mediate such social influence on this limited level of drug intake. Whether this influence extends to escalated drug consumption remains an open question. In this study, we compared the effect of the presence of an unfamiliar peer, naive to cocaine, on cocaine self-administration in rats having been exposed to either short (2h) or long-access sessions (6h). We showed that the presence of the peer drastically reduced both limited and escalated cocaine intake in males, while it had no effect on females during short-access sessions. Assessing the effect of STN photo-inhibition or high frequency (HF) stimulation in male rats, we demonstrated that it had no effect in the absence of the conspecific in short-access sessions, STN photo-manipulation suppressed the influence of the peer presence. Moreover, STN photo-inhibition and HF stimulation decreased drug consumption in long-access sessions, but no additive effect was observed when associated with the peer presence, confirming an overriding effect of STN manipulation. Taken together, these results highlight the potential influence of socially oriented manipulations on cocaine intake and further position the STN as a critical mediator of the effect of social presence on addictive-like behaviors.

**Abstract:**
Objective To integrate macro-transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing to analyze the differential gene expression between primary and brain metastatic breast cancer cells, as well as between active and dormant cancer cells within brain metastases, exploring their adaptation and remodeling abilities at different stages of brain metastasis. Methods Four public datasets were used: three mRNA microarray datasets from breast cancer and brain metastasis tissues, and one single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from active and dormant brain metastatic cells. Gene differential expression, pathway enrichment, and cell clustering analyses were performed to compare primary and metastatic breast cancer cells, as well as active and dormant cells in brain metastases, focusing on gene expression, metabolic pathways, and functional pathways. Results Metastatic breast cancer cells showed weakened pathways related to the extracellular matrix and protein digestion. Active cells exhibited enhanced cell cycle regulation, tumor proliferation, and hypoxia resistance pathways compared to dormant cells. Clustering analysis revealed that cluster 6, unique to dormant cells, had enhanced functions in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen formation, tumor inflammation siganure (TIS), and IL-10 signaling. Cluster 3 and 4 in active cells had enhanced DNA replication and tumor proliferation pathways, respectively. Conclusion This study highlights the role of cancer cell characteristics and heterogeneity in the invasiveness of brain metastasis. Understanding these mechanisms can guide the development of more effective treatment strategies for breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) patients.

## Mu and delta opioid receptor antagonists increase the expression of social conditioned place preference in early adolescent mice

**Abstract:**
RationaleSocial behaviors undergo dramatic changes during adolescence, enabling the development of adult social abilities. These changes are intricately linked to the development of the brain reward system and the activity of endogenous opioid signaling. However, the involvement of the opioid system in the development of social behaviors still raises more questions than answers.

ObjectivesHere, we investigated the role of the endogenous opioid system in the rewarding effects of social contact in early and late adolescent male mice.

MethodsSocial reward was assessed using the social conditioned place preference task in early adolescent (~34 days old) and late adolescent (~41 days old) male mice that received a single dose of the selective opioid receptor antagonists cyprodime (1 mg/kg, i.p.), naltrindole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or norbinaltorphimine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) before the preference posttest.

ResultsThe administration of cyprodime or naltrindole before the posttest significantly increased the preference for the social-conditioned context in early but not late adolescent mice. In contrast, pretreatment with norbinaltorphimine had no effect on context preference.

ConclusionsOur findings support a modified version of the state-dependent mu-opioid receptor model of social behavior, where the effects of opioid ligands are not reversed during development but rather weaken or disappear with age. Furthermore, the results indicate that interactions with siblings in early adolescent mice are motivated by negative reinforcement, whereas those in late adolescence are motivated by positive reinforcement.

**Abstract:**
The dopaminergic system has been extensively studied for its role in behavior in animals as well as human neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases. However, we still know little about how dopamine levels are tightly regulated in vivo. To identify novel regulators of dopamine, we utilized Drosophila melanogaster cuticle pigmentation as a readout, where dopamine is a precursor to melanin. We measured dopamine from genes known to be critical for cuticle pigmentation and performed an RNAi-based screen to identify new regulators of pigmentation. We found 153 potential pigmentation genes, which were enriched for conserved homologs and disease- associated genes as well as developmental signaling pathways and mitochondria-associated proteins. From 35 prioritized candidates, we found 10 caused significant reduction in head dopamine levels and one caused an increase. Two genes, clueless and mask (multiple ankyrin repeats single KH domain), upon knockdown, reduced dopamine levels in the brain. Further examination suggests that Mask regulates the transcription of the rate-limiting dopamine synthesis enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase, and its knockdown causes dopamine-dependent sleep phenotypes. In summary, by studying genes that affect cuticle pigmentation, a phenotype seemingly unrelated to the nervous system, we were able to identify several genes that affect dopamine metabolism as well as a novel regulator of behavior.

## Growth directions and stiffness across cell layers determine whether tissues stay smooth or buckle

**Abstract:**
From smooth shapes to buckles, nature exhibits organs of various shapes and forms. How cells grow to produce smooth shaped leaves and sepals remain unclear. Here, we show that growth along the longitudinal axis during early developmental stages and comparable stiffness across both epidermal layers of Arabidopsis sepals are essential for smoothness, as seen in the wild type. We identified a mutant (as2-7D) with ectopic expression of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) on the outer epidermis. Our analysis reveals that ectopic AS2 expression causes the outer epidermis of as2-7D sepals to buckle during early stages of sepal development. We show that buckling of the outer epidermis occurs due to conflicting cell growth directions and unequal tissue stiffness across the epidermal layers. Overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor Kip-related protein 1 (KRP1) in as2-7D restores sepal smoothness by aligning the growth directions of the outer epidermal cells along the longitudinal axis, while also increasing the overall stiffness of the outer epidermis. Furthermore, buckling is associated with the convergence of auxin efflux transporter protein PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) to generate outgrowth in the sepals at later stages, suggesting that buckling can initiate outgrowths. Our findings suggest that in addition to molecular cues influencing tissue mechanics, tissue mechanics can also modulate molecular signals, giving rise to well-defined shapes.

One-Sentence SummaryThe asymmetric leaves 2-7D mutant sepals buckle due to discoordination of growth between the two epidermal layers.

**Abstract:**
Glioblastoma is the deadliest brain cancer, characterized by large cellular diversity whose complexity and organizing principles are only starting to be uncovered. Both neurodevelopment-like and mesenchymal-like cell states have been described in glioblastoma1-8, with the latter being strongly implicated in malignancy and disease progression8-11. However, the nature of these mesenchymal-like cell states remains unresolved. Here, we performed deep single-cell RNA sequencing of rare glioblastoma cases where tissue could be sampled from tumor core to macroscopically normal cortex. We discovered that previously defined mesenchymal-like tumor cell states instead represented a wound response that was shared across both malignant and non-malignant cell types and was spatially confined to the tumor bulk. Using glioblastoma organoids, we showed that the wound response transcriptional state could be reversibly induced in vitro by hypoxia and human plasma. We used multiplex single-molecule spatial transcriptomics12 on a large patient cohort to show that the activation of wound response states was associated with hypoxia, and organized by distance to perivascular niches. Our findings help reconceptualize the cellular landscape of glioblastoma, wherein a reactive wound-response tissue state shared by all cells in the tumor bulk is superimposed on a fundamentally neurodevelopmental and glial tumor.

**Abstract:**
Individuals with Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB), a rare genetic skin disease characterised by loss of function mutations in the Laminin332 (Lam332), do not survive beyond their first birthday. Here we report that loss of Lam332 leads to absence of cholesterol lipid from the epidermis in vitro and in vivo. Using 3D skin equivalents, a JEB mouse model and JEB patient samples we confirmed changes in epidermal lipid synthesis, which was further explored using lipidomics. Cholesterol biosynthesis genes were increased with loss of Laminin-332 in vitro, however a decrease in immunofluorescence lipid staining was observed. Cholesterol transport in Laminin-332 knockdown keratinocytes was revealed to be disrupted, which in keratinocytes is dependent on the actomyosin network. In conclusion these findings suggest a role for the basement membrane protein Laminin-332 in lipid metabolism in the skin, and a broader role for epidermal homeostasis and barrier formation. Restoration of cholesterol transport in epidermal keratinocytes of JEB patients offers the potential to improve their skin barrier.

## Resting-state is not enough: alpha and mu rhythms change shape across development, but lack diagnostic sensitivity

**Abstract:**
In the human brain, the alpha rhythm in occipital cortex and the mu rhythm in sensorimotor cortex are among the most prominent rhythms, with both rhythms functionally implicated in gating modality-specific information. Separation of these rhythms is non-trivial due to the spatial mixing of these oscillations in sensor space. Using a computationally efficient processing pipeline requiring no manual data cleaning, we isolated alpha and/or mu rhythms from electroencephalography recordings performed on 1605 children aged 5-18. Using the extracted time series for each rhythm, we characterized the waveform shape on a cycle-by-cycle basis and examined whether and how the waveform shape differs across development. We demonstrate that alpha and mu rhythms both exhibit nonsinusoidal waveform shape that changes significantly across development, in addition to the known large changes in oscillatory frequency. This dataset also provided an opportunity to assess oscillatory measures for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found no differences in the resting-state features of these alpha-band rhythms for either ADHD or ASD in comparison to typically developing participants in this dataset. While waveform shape is ignored by traditional Fourier spectral analyses, these nonsinusoidal properties may be informative for building more constrained generative models for different types of alpha-band rhythms, yielding more specific insight into their generation.

**Abstract:**
Cortical activity results from the interplay between network-connected regions that integrate information and stimulus-driven processes originating from sensory motor networks responding to specific tasks. Separating the information due to each of these components has been challenging, and the relationship as measured by fMRI in each of these cases Rest (network) and Task (stimulus-driven) remains a significant outstanding question in the study of large-scale brain dynamics. In this study, we develop a network ordinary differential equation (ODE) model using advanced system identification tools to analyze fMRI data from both rest and task conditions. We demonstrate that task-specific ODEs are essentially a subset of rest-specific ODEs across four different tasks from the Human Connectome Project. By assuming that task activity is a relative complement of rest activity, our model significantly improves predictions of reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis, leading to a 9 % increase in explanatory power (R2) across the 14 subtasks tested. We have additionally shown that these results hold for predicting missing trials and accuracy on a per individual basis as well as classifying Tasks trajectories or resulting dynamic Task functional connectivity. Our findings establish the principle of the Active Cortex Model, which posits that the cortex is always active and that Rest State encompasses all processes, while certain subsets of processes get elevated to perform specific task computations. Thus, this study is an important milestone in the development of the fMRI equation - to causally link large-scale brain activity, brain structural connectivity, and behavioral variables within a single framework.

**Abstract:**
The ocean acts as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and resulting in substantial uptake of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. As biological processes in the oceans such as net primary production (NPP) contribute significantly to this sink, understanding how they will shift in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 is necessary to project future ocean carbon storage capacity. Macronutrient and micronutrient resource limitation within the oceans regulates NPP, and while some micronutrients such as zinc (Zn) are present at very low concentrations, their ability to limit NPP has remained unclear. Zn is a key micronutrient used by phytoplankton for a multitude of metabolic functions, yet there have been few observations of its influence on natural oceanic phytoplankton populations. In this study, we observed Zn limitation of growth in the natural phytoplankton community of Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, in addition to primary iron (Fe) limitation. Shipboard incubation experiments amended with Zn and Fe resulted in significantly higher chlorophyll a content and dissolved inorganic carbon drawdown compared to Fe addition alone. Zn and Fe stress response proteins detected in incubation and environmental biomass provided independent verification of algal co-stress for these micronutrients. We consider total biomass and low surface ocean pCO2 as potential drivers of environmental Zn stress. This study definitively establishes that Zn limitation can occur in the modern oceans, opening up new possibility space in our understanding of nutrient regulation of NPP through geologic time, and we consider the future of oceanic Zn limitation in the face of climate change.

**Abstract:**
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is typically treated empirically with vancomycin, with therapy later tailored based on susceptibility results. However, these tests occur before vancomycin exposure and do not account for adaptation during empiric treatment that can alter S. aureus' susceptibility to first-line drugs. To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU, impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes. Our findings suggest a probabilistic approach to antimicrobial therapy, advocating for rapid genomic diagnostics alongside susceptibility testing to better anticipate and respond to evolutionary changes.

**Abstract:**
Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have demonstrated robust induction of neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T cell activation, however CD8+ responses are variable, and the duration of immunity and protection against variants are limited. Here we repurposed our DNA origami vaccine nanotechnology, DoriVac, for targeting infectious viruses, namely SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and Ebola. The DNA origami nanoparticle, conjugated with infectious-disease-specific heptad repeat 2 (HR2) peptides, which act as highly conserved antigens, and CpG adjuvant at precise nanoscale spacing, induced neutralizing antibodies, Th1 CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in naive mice, with significant improvement over a bolus control. Pre-clinical studies using lymph-node-on-a-chip systems validated that DoriVac, when conjugated with antigenic peptides or proteins, induced promising cellular and humoral immune responses in human cells. Moreover, DoriVac bearing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein achieved immune responses comparable to current mRNA vaccine platforms while potentially reducing storage constraints. These results suggest that DoriVac holds potential as a versatile, modular vaccine platform, capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immunities, underscoring its potential utility in addressing future pandemics.

**Abstract:**
Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker Brainstem Thalamus Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking activity upon multi-whisker stimulation, resembling the stable response pattern observed in barrels. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions.

**Abstract:**
Insulator proteins act as a barrier of enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs). The main insulator protein in vertebrates is CTCF, a DNA-binding protein (DBP). However, other DBPs associated with insulators of EPIs are still unclear. Hence, we developed a systematic, comprehensive deep learning-based approach for identifying the DNA motifs of DBPs associated with insulators. We discovered 97 directional and minor nondirectional motifs in human fibroblast cells that corresponded to 23 DBPs related to insulator function, CTCF, and/or other types of chromosomal transcriptional regulation reported in previous studies. The estimated CTCF orientation bias was consistently proportional to CTCF orientation bias observed in chromatin interactions. The motifs were significantly more abundant at insulator sites separated by repressive and active regions, at boundary sites identified by chromatin interaction data, and at splice sites than other DBPs. For instance, we found that the key regulator MyoD-binding site is located at an insulator site near a gene involved in skeletal muscle differentiation and function. Finally, the insulator-pairing model explains that homologous and heterologous insulator-insulator pairing interactions are orientation-dependent. These findings contribute to elucidate novel transcriptional regulations.

**Abstract:**
Sequence-specific interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with genomic DNA underlie many cellular processes. High-throughput in vitro binding assays coupled with machine learning have made it possible to accurately define such molecular recognition in a biophysically interpretable way for hundreds of TFs across many structural families, providing new avenues for predicting how the sequence preference of a TF is impacted by disease-associated mutations in its DNA binding domain. We developed a method based on a reference-free tetrahedral representation of variation in base preference within a given structural family that can be used to accurately predict the effect of mutations in the protein sequence of the TF. Using the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain families as test cases, our results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately predicting the shifts ({Delta}{Delta}{Delta}G/RT) in binding free energy associated with TF mutants by leveraging high-quality DNA binding models for sets of homologous wild-type TFs.

**Abstract:**
KvS proteins are voltage-gated potassium channel subunits that form functional channels when assembled into heteromers with Kv2.1 (KCNB1) or Kv2.2 (KCNB2). Mammals have 10 KvS subunits: Kv5.1 (KCNF1), Kv6.1 (KCNG1), Kv6.2 (KCNG2), Kv6.3 (KCNG3), Kv6.4 (KCNG4), Kv8.1 (KCNV1), Kv8.2 (KCNV2), Kv9.1 (KCNS1), Kv9.2 (KCNS2), and Kv9.3 (KCNS3). Electrically excitable cells broadly express channels containing Kv2 subunits and most neurons have substantial Kv2 conductance. However, whether KvS subunits contribute to these conductances has not been clear, leaving the physiological roles of KvS subunits poorly understood. Here, we identify that two potent Kv2 inhibitors, used in combination, can distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers and Kv2-only channels. We find that Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, or Kv9-containing channels are resistant to the Kv2-selective pore-blocker RY785 yet remain sensitive to the Kv2-selective voltage sensor modulator guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX). Using these inhibitors in mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons, we find predominantly RY785-sensitive conductances consistent with channels composed entirely of Kv2 subunits. In contrast, RY785-resistant but GxTX-sensitive conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels predominate in mouse and human dorsal root ganglion neurons. These results establish an approach to pharmacologically distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers from Kv2-only channels, enabling investigation of the physiological roles of endogenous KvS subunits. These findings suggest that drugs which distinguish KvS subunits could modulate electrical activity of subsets of Kv2-expressing cell types.

**Abstract:**
Endolysins are highly evolved bacteriophage-encoded lytic enzymes produced to damage the bacterial cell wall for phage progeny release. They offer promising potential as highly specific lytic proteins with a low chance of bacterial resistance. The diversity in lysin sequences and domain organization can be staggering. In silico analysis of bacteriophage and prophage genomes can help identify endolysins exhibiting unique features and high antibacterial activity, hence feeding the pipeline of narrow-spectrum protein antibiotics. Mycobacteriophage lysis cassettes mostly have two lytic enzymes, LysinA and LysinB. The enzyme LysinA targets peptidoglycan in the cell wall and possesses a modular architecture. LysinB typically contains a single domain and acts upon the mycolyl ester linkages in mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (Payne et al., 2010). This study aimed to find novel LysinBs against Mycobacterium fortuitum. After a detailed in silico characterization of lysis cassettes from three M. fortuitum prophages, we chose to work on a LysinB (hereafter described as LysinB_MF) found in an incomplete prophage (phiE1336, 9.4 kb in strain E1336). LysinB_MF showed low sequence similarity with any other endolysins in the database and formed a separate clade on phylogenetic analysis. LysinB_MFs structure, extracted from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, demonstrated a modular architecture with two structurally distinct domains: a peptidoglycan-binding domain (PGBD) at the N-terminal and the characteristic alpha/beta hydrolase domain connected via a linker peptide. We found the alpha/beta hydrolase domain, which is the enzyme-active domain (EAD), contains the conserved Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad with a tunnel-like topology and forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The PGBD shows structural similarity to the cell-wall binding domain of an amidase from Clostridium acetobutylicum, hinting at its acquisition due to domain mobility. Our in silico electrostatic potential analysis suggested that PGBD might be essential to the enzyme activity. Based on our analysis, PGBD emerged as an integral constituent of enzymes with diverse functional properties and is predicted to be conserved cross-kingdom. Overall, this study highlights the importance of mining mycobacterial prophages as a novel endolysin source. It also provides unique insights into the diverse architecture of mycobacteriophage-encoded endolysins and the importance of functional domains for their catalytic activities.

**Abstract:**
Kinases are a diverse group of enzymes that use ATP to phosphorylate a variety of substrates. Protein kinases evolved in eukaryotes as important mediators of cell signalling that target specific amino acid side chains to modulate downstream protein function. Among them, the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) are a family of intracellular protein kinases that form signalling cascades responding to a number of stimuli, that control fundamental mechanisms such as proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and cell death. Signals propagate through consecutive kinases which eventually phosphorylate and activate a MAPK. Here, we show that the dual specificity threonine/tyrosine MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks or MEKs) are able to phosphorylate and activate their substrate MAPKs using ADP as well as ATP in vitro. As the pathways are involved in the stress response, we speculate that it would represent an advantage to be able to maintain signalling under conditions such as hypoxia, that occur under a number of cell stresses, including cancer and atherosclerosis, where the available pool of ATP could be depleted.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundFocused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging non-invasive technique for neuromodulation in the central nervous system (CNS). Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) leverages ultrafast Power Doppler Imaging (PDI) to detect changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV), which correlate well with neuronal activity and thus hold promise to monitor brain responses to FUS.

ObjectiveInvestigate the immediate and short-term effects of transcranial FUS neuromodulation in the brain with fUSI by characterizing hemodynamic responses.

MethodsWe designed a setup that aligns a FUS transducer with a linear array to allow immediate subsequent monitoring of the hemodynamic response with fUSI during and after FUS neuromodulation (FUS-fUSI) in lightly anesthetized mice. We investigated the effects of varying pressures and transducer positions on the hemodynamic responses.

ResultsWe found that higher FUS pressures increase the size of the activated brain area, as well as the magnitude of change in CBV and could show that sham sonications did not produce hemodynamic responses. Unilateral sonications resulted in bilateral hemodynamic changes with a significantly stronger response on the ipsilateral side. FUS neuromodulation in mice with a cranial window showed distinct activation patterns that were frequency-dependent and different from the activation patterns observed in the transcranial model.

ConclusionfUSI is hereby shown capable of transcranially monitoring online and short-term hemodynamic effects in the brain during and following FUS neuromodulation.

**Abstract:**
Most thyroid cancer deaths are attributed to a subset of poorly differentiated, metastatic tumors. To improve treatment options for these aggressive thyroid cancers, we developed a novel thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR)-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell therapy, which demonstrated antigen-specific activation and antitumor efficacy against TSHR-overexpressing cell lines in vitro and in vivo. However, de-differentiated thyroid cancers downregulate TSHR. We therefore developed a potent treatment strategy by combining our novel TSHR-CART cells with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, which redifferentiate thyroid tumors and upregulate TSHR expression. In patient-derived anaplastic thyroid cancer xenografts, combination therapy of TSHR-CART cells and MAPK inhibitors led to increased TSHR expression on the tumor tissue and significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy and prolonged survival compared to TSHR-CART monotherapy.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEPoor target selection and antigen escape limit CART cell efficacy in solid tumors. We developed TSHR-CART cells to treat differentiated thyroid cancers but observed TSHR downregulation in dedifferentiated thyroid cancers. We found that MAPK inhibitors restored TSHR expression and sensitized these cancers to TSHR-CART cell therapy.

**Abstract:**
Task errors are used to learn and refine motor skills. We investigated how task assistance influences learned neural representations using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), which map neural activity into movement via a decoder. We analyzed motor cortex activity as monkeys practiced BCI with a decoder that adapted to improve or maintain performance over days. Over time, task-relevant information became concentrated in fewer neurons, unlike with fixed decoders. At the population level, task information also became largely confined to a few neural modes that accounted for an unexpectedly small fraction of the population variance. A neural network model suggests the adaptive decoders directly contribute to forming these more compact neural representations. Our findings show that assistive decoders manipulate error information used for long-term learning computations like credit assignment, which informs our understanding of motor learning and has implications for designing real-world BCIs.

**Abstract:**
Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) are well validated antimicrobial targets, but the prevalence of {beta}-lactamase driven resistance and, more rarely, target-based mutations, necessitates new classes of PBP-targeting drugs. Here we describe the discovery and optimisation of novel, bicyclic peptide (Bicycle(R)) inhibitors of E. coli PBP3 (EcPBP3) using a proprietary phage display platform, and their conjugation to linear antimicrobial peptides to confer outer membrane permeation. These molecules exhibited high-affinity binding to E. coli PBP3 and a viable spectrum of killing activity against clinically relevant species of the Enterobacterales. X-ray crystallography was used to explore the mode of binding to PBP3, enabling increased target affinity and improvement of in vitro stability. These compounds bind to the transpeptidase active site cleft of PBP3 and represent a novel non-{beta}-lactam chemical class of high affinity, non-covalent penicillin binding protein inhibitors.

## SMAdd-seq: Probing chromatin accessibility with small molecule DNA intercalation and nanopore sequencing

**Abstract:**
Studies of in vivo chromatin organization have relied on the accessibility of the underlying DNA to nucleases or methyltransferases, which is limited by their requirement for purified nuclei and enzymatic treatment. Here, we introduce a nanopore-based sequencing technique called Small-Molecule Adduct sequencing (SMAdd-seq), where we profile chromatin accessibility by treating nuclei or intact cells with a small molecule, angelicin. Angelicin reacts with thymine bases in linker DNA not bound to core nucleosomes after UV light exposure, thereby labeling accessible DNA regions. By applying SMAdd-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that angelicin-modified DNA can be detected by its distinct nanopore current signals. To systematically identify angelicin modifications and analyze chromatin structure, we developed a neural network model, NEural network for mapping MOdifications in nanopore long-reads (NEMO). NEMO accurately called expected nucleosome occupancy patterns near transcription start sites at both bulk and single-molecule levels. We observe heterogeneity in chromatin structure and identify clusters of single-molecule reads with varying configurations at specific yeast loci. Furthermore, SMAdd-seq performs equivalently on purified yeast nuclei and intact cells, indicating the promise of this method for in vivo chromatin labeling on long single molecules to measure native chromatin dynamics and heterogeneity.

**Abstract:**
Understanding how the eyes, head, and hands coordinate in natural contexts is a critical challenge in visuomotor coordination research, often constrained by sedentary or restricted tasks and cued actions. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment where participants self-generated pick-and-place actions in a virtual environment, recording concurrent gaze and body movements. Subjects exhibited intricate translation and rotation movements of the eyes, head, and hands during the task. We employed time-dependent principal component analysis to study the relationship between the movements of the eyes, head, and hands relative to action onset. We reduced the overall dimensionality into 2D representations, capturing up to 65\% of the movement variance just in time with the actions. Our analysis revealed the eyes synchronized with the head and hands close to action onset, with variations in coupling observed in horizontal and vertical planes, indicating distinct mechanisms for coordination in the brain. Crucially, the head and hands remained tightly coupled throughout the observation period, suggesting a shared neural code driving these effectors. Notably, the low-dimensional representations of the eye-head-hand movement vectors showed maximum predictive accuracy of the upcoming action location ~200 ms before onset, highlighting just-in-time coordination among the three effectors. Furthermore, predictive accuracy was significantly influenced by the location of the upcoming action. Our study emphasizes differential visuomotor control shaped by task structure, providing insights into the dynamic interplay of eye, head, and hand movements during natural behavior.

Neural processing of sensory information takes time. Consequently, to estimate the current state of the world, the brain must rely on predictive processes - for example, extrapolating the motion of a ball to determine its probable present position. Some evidence implicates early (pre-cortical) processing in extrapolation, but it remains unclear whether extrapolation continues during later-stage (cortical) processing, where further delays accumulate. Moreover, the majority of such evidence relies on invasive neurophysiological techniques in animals, with accurate characterisation of extrapolation effects in the human brain currently lacking. Here, we address these issues by demonstrating how precise probabilistic maps can be constructed from human EEG recordings. Participants (N = 18, 2 sessions) viewed a stimulus moving along a circular trajectory while EEG was recorded. Using LDA classification, we extracted maps of stimulus location over time and found evidence of a forwards temporal shift occurring across temporally distinct processing stages. This accelerated emergence of position representations indicates extrapolation occurring at multiple stages of processing, with representations progressively shifted closer to real-time. We further show evidence of representational overshoot during early-stage processing following unexpected changes to an objects trajectory, and demonstrate that the observed dynamics can emerge without supervision in a simulated neural network via spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

**Abstract:**
Improvements in single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) assays have enabled detailed characterization of somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) at the single-cell level. Yet, current computational methods are mostly designed for detecting chromosome-scale changes in cancer samples with low sequencing coverage. Here, we introduce HiScanner (High-resolution Single-Cell Allelic copy Number callER), which combines read depth, B-allele frequency, and haplotype phasing to identify CNAs with high resolution. In simulated data, HiScanner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various CNA types and sizes. When applied to high-coverage scWGS data from 65 cells across 11 neurotypical human brains, HiScanner shows a superior ability to detect smaller CNAs, uncovering distinct CNA patterns between neurons and oligodendrocytes. We also generated low-coverage scWGS data from 179 cells sampled from the same meningioma patient at two time points. For this serial dataset, integration of CNAs with point mutations revealed evolutionary trajectories of tumor cells. These findings show that HiScanner enables accurate characterization of frequency, clonality, and distribution of CNAs at the single-cell level in both non-neoplastic and neoplastic cells.

**Abstract:**
The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural computations to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviors and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep-learning behavioral analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective-motivational behaviors without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic mu-opioid receptor promoter to drive chemogenetic inhibition in opioid-responsive ACC neurons. This targeted neuromodulation recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain. This opioid-mimetic gene therapy offers a new strategy for precision pain management by targeting a key nociceptive cortical circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

**Abstract:**
Bioluminescence is the production of visible light by living organisms. It occurs through the oxidation of a luciferin substrate catalysed by luciferase enzymes. Auxiliary proteins, such as fluorescent proteins and luciferin-binding proteins, can modify the light emitted wavelength or stabilize reactive luciferin molecules, respectively. Additionally, calcium ions are crucial for the luminescence across various species. Despite the large phylogenetic distribution of bioluminescent organisms, only a few systems have been comprehensively studied. Notably, cnidarian species of the Renilla genus utilize a coelenterazine-dependent luciferase, a calcium-dependent coelenterazine-binding protein and a green fluorescent protein. We investigated the bioluminescence of three sea pen species: Pennatula phosphorea, Anthoptilum murrayi and Funiculina quadrangularis (Pennatuloidea, Anthozoa). Their light-emission spectra reveal peaks at 510, 513 and 485 nm, respectively. A coelenterazine-based reaction was demonstrated in all three species. Using transcriptome analyses, we identified predicted transcripts coding for luciferases, green fluorescent proteins and coelenterazine-binding proteins for P. phosphorea and A. murrayi. Immunodetection confirmed the expression of luciferase in P. phosphorea and F. quadrangularis. We also expressed recombinant luciferase of A. murrayi, confirming its activity. We highlighted the role of calcium ions in bioluminescence, possibly associated with the mechanism of substrate release at the level of coelenterazine-binding proteins. The study proposes a model for anthozoan bioluminescence, offering new avenues for future ecological and functional research on these luminous organisms.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundPriming plant immunity offers a powerful and sustainable strategy for crop protection, enabling plants to respond faster and more efficiently to threats. This increased readiness is driven by transcriptional memory--molecular mechanisms that store and recall stress responses, including protein accumulation, transcription factor activity, and epigenetic modifications. However, the interplay among transcriptional stress memory, its stability, and its broader impact on plant resistance remain poorly understood.

ResultsHere, we reveal a tight link between transcriptional memory and defense priming in Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to repeated acoustic stimulations. Using a combination of experiments and computational modeling, we show that enhanced resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum after three stimulations arises from three key mechanisms: (1) preemptive activation of defense pathways in noninoculated plants, (2) increased diversification of defense-related genes, and (3) gene priming. This heightened defense state is sustained by transcriptional stress memory across thousands of genes, which is likely orchestrated by transcription factor cascades.

Challenging the conventional view that priming involves stepwise activation of distinct pathways, our findings suggest that priming instead results from the simultaneous modulation of a broad spectrum of defense pathways. This built-in redundancy enhances resilience, shielding primed plants from the genetic variability-driven resistance loss observed in naive plants. However, this same redundancy imposes strict limits on further enhancing the resistance. More frequent acoustic stimulations did not amplify the protective effect, and transcriptional memory faded within 1.5 days after stimulation ceased.

ConclusionsBy integrating experimental and computational approaches, we present a genome-scale quantitative model of stress-induced gene regulation. Our results highlight the trade-offs inherent in transcriptional memory-driven priming, revealing both its potential and its limitations in optimizing plant immunity.

**Abstract:**
In the canonical interpretation of dopaminergic neuron activity during Pavlovian conditioning, initially cell firing is triggered by unexpected rewards. Upon learning, activation instead follows the reward-predictive conditioned stimulus, and when expected rewards are withheld, firing is inhibited. However, little is known about dopaminergic neuron activity during the actual learning process in operant tasks. Here, we recorded optogenetically identified dopaminergic neurons of ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice training in multiple, successive operant sensory discrimination tasks. A delay between nose-poke choices and trial outcome signals (for reward or punishment) probed for instructional or predictive activity. During training, but prior to criterion performance, firing increased after correct, but not incorrect choices, but prior to outcome signals. Thus, the neurons predicted whether choices would be rewarded, despite the animals subthreshold behavioral performance. Surprisingly, these neurons also fired after reward delivery, as if the rewards had been unexpected according to the canonical view, but activity was inhibited after punishment signals, as if the reward had been expected after all. These inconsistencies suggest revision of theoretical formulations of dopaminergic neuronal activity to embody multiple roles in temporal difference learning and actor-critic models. Furthermore, on training trials when these neurons predicted that a given choice was correct and would be rewarded, surprisingly, the mice adhered to other non-rewarded and untrained task strategies (e.g., alternation). The DA neurons reward prediction activity could serve as critic signals for the choices just made. This consistent with the notion that the brain must reconcile multiple Bayesian belief representations during learning.

Significance statementThe canonical view of dopaminergic function based on classical conditioning studies evokes reward-prediction error (RPE) signaling. Here, in mice performing a series of novel operant tasks with a delay between behavioral responses and reward/punishment signals, some neurons began firing after correct (but not incorrect) responses, but prior to the trial outcome (reward/punishment) signal. Nevertheless, the animals performed at chance levels, employing behavioral strategies other than the one signaled by the neurons. Furthermore, these same neurons showed canonical RPE responses, increased firing after reward signals (interpreted as the reward being unexpected) and firing rate decreases punishment (interpreted as a reward having been expected). These findings indicate that dopaminergic neurons can participate in diverse functions underlying different behavioral strategies for learning.

**Abstract:**
It is vital to understand the genomic basis of differences in ecologically important traits if we are to understand the impact of global change on biodiversity and enhance our ability for targeted intervention. This study explores the potential of a novel genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach for identifying loci underlying quantitative polygenic traits in natural populations, based on phenotypic population means and genome-wide allele frequency data as obtained e.g. by PoolSeq approaches. Extensive population genetic forward simulations demonstrate that the approach is generally effective for oligogenic and moderately polygenic traits and relatively insensitive to low heritability. However, applicability is limited for highly polygenic architectures and pronounced population structure. The required sample size is moderate with very good results being obtained already for a few dozen populations scored. When combined with machine learning for feature selection, the method performs very well in predicting population means. The data efficiency of the method, particularly when using pooled sequencing and bulk phenotyping, makes GWAS studies more accessible for research in biodiversity genomics. Moreover, in a direct comparison to individual based GWAS, the proposed method performed constistently better with regard to the number of true positive loci identified and prediction accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the promise of popGWAS for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in natural populations.

**Abstract:**
Hearing loss is a pervasive global health challenge with profound impacts on communication, cognitive function, and quality of life. Recent studies have established age-related hearing loss as a significant risk factor for dementia, highlighting the importance of hearing loss research. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), which are electrophysiological recordings of synchronized neural activity from the auditory nerve and brainstem, serve as in vivo readouts for sensory hair cell, synaptic integrity, hearing sensitivity, and other key features of auditory pathway functionality, making them highly valuable for both basic neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics. Despite their utility, traditional ABR analyses rely heavily on subjective manual interpretation, leading to considerable variability and limiting reproducibility across studies. Here, we introduce Auditory Brainstem Response Analyzer (ABRA), a novel open-source graphical user interface powered by deep learning, which automates and standardizes ABR waveform analysis. ABRA employs convolutional neural networks trained on diverse datasets collected from multiple experimental settings, achieving rapid and unbiased extraction of key ABR metrics, including peak amplitude, latency, and auditory threshold estimates. We demonstrate that ABRAs deep learning models provide performance comparable to expert human annotators while dramatically reducing analysis time and enhancing reproducibility across datasets from different laboratories. By bridging hearing research, sensory neuroscience, and advanced computational techniques, ABRA facilitates broader interdisciplinary insights into auditory function. An online version of the tool is available for use at no cost at https://abra.ucsd.edu.

**Abstract:**
Humans are the only species with the ability to convey an unbounded number of novel thoughts by combining words into sentences. This process is guided by complex semantic and abstract syntactic representations. Despite their centrality to human cognition, the neural mechanisms underlying these systems remain obscured by inherent limitations of non-invasive brain measures and a near total focus on comprehension paradigms. Here, we address these limitations with high-resolution neurosurgical recordings (electrocorticography) and a controlled sentence production experiment. We uncover distinct cortical networks encoding word-level, semantic, and syntactic information. These networks are broadly distributed across traditional language areas, but with focal sensitivity to syntactic structure in middle and inferior frontal gyri. In contrast to previous findings from comprehension studies, these networks are largely non-overlapping, each specialized for just one of the three linguistic constructs we investigate. Most strikingly, our data reveal an unexpected property of higher-order linguistic information: it is encoded independent of neural activity levels. We propose that this "magnitude-independent coding" scheme represents a novel mechanism for encoding information, reserved for higher-order cognition more broadly.

**Abstract:**
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Previous studies have reported more than 50 CME accessory proteins; however, the mechanism driving the invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) remains elusive. We show by quantitative live cell imaging that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCDC32, a poorly characterized endocytic accessory protein, leads to the accumulation of unstable flat clathrin assemblies. CCDC32 interacts with the -appendage domain (AD) of AP2 in vitro and with full length AP2 complexes in cells. Deletion of aa78-98 in CCDC32, corresponding to a predicted -helix, abrogates AP2 binding and CCDC32s early function in CME. Furthermore, clinically observed nonsense mutations in CCDC32, which result in C-terminal truncations that lack aa78-98, are linked to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome (CFNDS). Overall, our data demonstrate the function of a novel endocytic accessory protein, CCDC32, in regulating CCP stabilization and invagination, critical early stages of CME.

SummaryWe show that CCDC32, a poorly studied and functionally ambiguous protein, binds to AP2 and regulates CCP stabilization and invagination. Clinically observed mutations in CCDC32 lose their ability to interact with AP2 likely contributing to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome.

**Abstract:**
Molecular convergence, where specific non-synonymous changes in protein-coding genes lead to identical amino acid substitutions across multiple lineages, provides strong evidence of adaptive evolution. Detecting this signal across diverse taxa can reveal broad evolutionary mechanisms that may not be apparent when studying individual lineages. In this study, we search for convergent substitutions in the most speciose group of vertebrates, teleost fishes. Using an unsupervised approach, we detected convergence in 89 protein-coding genes across 143 chromosomal-level genomes. To assess their functional implications, we integrate data on protein properties, gene expression across species and tissues, single-cell RNA sequencing of zebrafish embryonic development, and gene perturbation experiments in zebrafish. The convergent genes were associated with diverse processes including embryonic development, tissue morphogenesis, metabolism, and responses to hormones and heat stress. The convergent substitutions altered amino acid properties, with some occurring at functionally critical sites. Notably, only one-third of these genes were tissue-specific, while the majority were expressed across multiple tissues and cell types. Genetic perturbation data further showed that the convergent genes can affect multiple structures across diverse tissues. These results highlight the pleiotropic nature of the convergent genes. Using an evolutionary modeling approach, we show that adaptive variation tends to accumulate in genes with intermediate pleiotropy, enabling organisms to overcome selective pressures during ecological shifts. Although traditionally considered a source of constraint, we argue that adaptation via genes with intermediate pleiotropy might be particularly advantageous following periods of ecological shifts, and can potentially lead to the evolution of convergent phenotypes.

**Abstract:**
Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures supports long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and home literacy environment, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to second-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop early in infancy but undergo further refinement between birth and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.

## Synergistic reinforcement learning by cooperation of the cerebellum and basal ganglia

**Abstract:**
The cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia are essential for flexible learning in mammals. Although traditionally thought to operate under different learning rules, recent evidence suggests that both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum may employ reinforcement learning mechanisms. This raises the question of how these structures coordinate when a common reward prediction error mechanism is active. To address this issue, we first examined output signals from the basal ganglia and cerebellum following the activity of the cerebral cortex. We recorded single-neuron activity from the output regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia - the cerebellar nuclei (CN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) - in both male and female ChR2 transgenic rats. Neurons in the CN and SNr exhibited distinct temporal response patterns; notably, the fast excitatory response in the CN, driven by mossy fiber input, was synchronized with the inhibitory response in the SNr, mediated via the direct pathway. Using these experimental findings together with connectome data, we developed both a semi-realistic spiking network model and a reservoir-based reinforcement learning model. In the latter model, successful learning depended on synaptic plasticity in both the cerebellum and basal ganglia with a temporal precision on the order of 10 ms. Furthermore, cortical {beta}-oscillations enhanced learning and optimal reinforcement learning occurred when the output of cerebellar and basal ganglia signal phase-locked at the frequency of cortical oscillation. Taken together, our results suggest that the coordinated output of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, driven by tightly tuned cortical input, underlies brain-wide synergistic reinforcement learning.

Significance StatementThe cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia support learning. Recent research suggests that both the basal ganglia and cerebellum use a similar learning process called reinforcement learning, which involves predicting rewards. To understand how these brain regions work together, we recorded brain activity in rats while photo-stimulating the cerebral cortex. We found that two types of responses in the cerebellum and basal ganglia were synchronized, which might help activate the cerebral cortex. A computer model showed that precise timing of signals from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia is important for learning. This timing was important only when the cerebral cortex worked in a specific frequency range. Our findings suggest that coordinated brain activity enhances learning.

**Abstract:**
De novo protein design represents a fundamental pursuit in protein engineering, yet current deep learning approaches remain constrained by their narrow design scope. Here we present Pinal, a large-scale frontier framework comprising 16 billion parameters and trained on 1.7 billion protein-text pairs, that bridges natural language understanding with protein design space, translating human design intent into novel protein sequences. Instead of a straightforward end-to-end textto-sequence generation, Pinal implements a two-stage process: first generating protein structures based on language instructions, then designing sequences conditioned on both the generated structure and the language input. This strategy effectively constrains the search space by operating in the more tractable structural domain. Through comprehensive computational evaluation, we demonstrate that Pinal achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches, including the concurrent work ESM3, while exhibiting robust generalization to novel protein structures beyond the PDB database. Lastly, we experimentally validated that four out of the eight de novo-designed alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), guided by natural language inputs, exhibited functional activity.

**Abstract:**
High-resolution energetic information about protein conformational ensembles is essential for understanding protein function, yet remains challenging to obtain. We present PIGEON-FEATHER, a method for calculating ensemble free energies of opening ({Delta}Gop) at single- or near-single-amino acid resolution for proteins of all sizes from hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry (HX/MS) data. PIGEON-FEATHER disambiguates and reconstructs all experimentally measured HX/MS isotopic mass envelopes using a Bayesian Monte Carlo sampling approach. We applied PIGEON-FEATHER to reveal how E. coli and human dihydrofolate reductases (ecDHFR, hDHFR) have evolved distinct ensembles. We show how two competitive inhibitors bind these orthologs differently, solving the longstanding mystery of why both therapeutic molecules inhibit hDHFR, but only one inhibits ecDHFR. Extending PIGEON-FEATHER to a large protein-DNA complex, we mapped ligand-induced ensemble reweighting in the E. coli lac repressor to describe the functional switching mechanism crucial for transcriptional regulation.

**Abstract:**
Sensory stimulation of the brain reverberates in its recurrent neural networks. However, current computational models of brain activity do not separate immediate sensory responses from this intrinsic dynamic. We apply a vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX), combining the concepts of "functional connectivity" and "encoding models", to intracranial recordings in humans. This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic. We find that the intrinsic dynamic enhances and prolongs the neural responses to scene cuts, eye movements, and sounds. Failing to account for these extrinsic inputs, leads to spurious recurrent connections that govern the intrinsic dynamic. We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching. The model shows that an external stimulus can reduce intrinsic noise. It also shows that sensory areas have mostly outward, whereas higher-order brain areas mostly incoming connections. We conclude that the response to an external audiovisual stimulus can largely be attributed to the intrinsic dynamic of the brain, already observed during rest.

**Abstract:**
Fasciolosis is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. It is a serious public health and veterinary concern, with significant consequences for both human and livestock populations. An abattoir-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January to September 2023 at Gondar ELFORA Abattoir, Ethiopia, to assess hematobiochemical alterations and pathological lesions induced by fasciolosis in slaughtered cattle. The study involved one hundred apparently healthy male local breed cattle, evenly split into fifty infected and fifty non-infected individuals, using a purposive sampling technique. Findings showed lower mean values for hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), total erythrocyte count (TEC), lymphocytes, monocytes, total protein, albumin, and glucose. Conversely, they had higher mean values for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total leukocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, eosinophils, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Basophil levels were similar in both groups. Liver alterations observed included hepatomegaly with rounded edges and the presence of juvenile flukes in the cut section of the parenchyma. In chronic cases, the liver appeared smaller, with a firm consistency, a corrugated capsule, and dilated bile ducts containing twisted flukes. Microscopically, during the acute phase, there was infiltration of eosinophils, hemosiderin pigmentation, and congestion around the central vein and sinusoids. In contrast, chronic cases exhibited fibrosis, proliferation of bile ducts, and metaplasia of columnar to cuboidal epithelial cells. The results of hematobiochemical alterations were consistent with gross and microscopic findings, indicating a significant impact on liver physiology and histology, leading to substantial losses in meat and milk production.

**Abstract:**
Expansion of a disease-specific tandem repeat is responsible for >45 Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs). The mismatch repair protein PMS2 is a modifier of somatic expansion and disease severity in Huntingtons disease (HD), a RED resulting from a CAG-repeat expansion. However, PMS2 shows different effects in different RED models, protecting against expansion in some and promoting it in others. To better understand this difference, we carried out a systematic study of the loss of PMS2 in mouse models of HD and the fragile X-related disorders (FXDs), a group of REDs resulting from a CGG-repeat expansion. In both models, loss of one Pms2 allele resulted in more expansions, while loss of both alleles resulted in more expansion in some organs but less in others. Thus, rather than reflecting different expansion mechanisms in different diseases, the previously reported differences in different model systems likely reflects the ability of PMS2 to promote expansion in some cellular contexts and to protect against it in others. In mouse embryonic stem cells containing both sets of repeats where PMS2 was expressed under the control of a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible promoter, low DOX concentrations produced a dose-dependent increase in expansions of both repeats, an effect that was dependent on the PMS2 nuclease domain, while higher DOX levels resulted in a decrease in expansions. Our findings have implications both for the mechanism of expansion and for therapeutic approaches to treat these diseases by reducing somatic expansion.

Significance statementExpansion of a disease-specific microsatellite is responsible for >45 Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs). The mismatch repair factor PMS2 has been identified as a genetic modifier of somatic expansion and disease severity in Huntingtons disease (HD). However, loss of PMS2 has different effects in different REDs models. Using mouse and cell models of the fragile X-related disorders and HD, we show that PMS2 has both pro-mutagenic and anti-mutagenic effects in both models depending on the cell type and that an intact nuclease domain is required for its ability to promote expansion. These findings support the idea that the REDs all share a common expansion mechanism and suggests a model for repeat expansion consistent with a dual role for PMS2 in this process.

**Abstract:**
Computational prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding cell biology and drug development, offering a promising alternative to costly and time-consuming experimental methods. While the original GenPPi software represented an advance in ab initio PPI network prediction from bacterial genomes, its reliance on high sequence similarity limited it. In this work, we introduce the GenPPi 1.5 and enhance prediction capabilities. We incorporated a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, trained on 60 biophysical features derived from amino acid propensity indices, to overcome the previous limitation by classifying protein similarity even in low sequence identity scenarios (targeting > 65% identity). Furthermore, to address the computational complexity arising from the increased number of potential interactions generated by the RF model, especially within extensive conserved phylogenetic profiles, we developed and integrated the Reduced Interaction Sampling (RIS) algorithm. RIS stochastically samples interactions within these extensive profiles, optimizing performance for complete genome analysis. Our multifaceted methodology included integrating RF for efficient similarity classification and implementing RIS to reduce the computational burden. We evaluated the effectiveness through extensive simulations across different configurations (operational modes, Top N selected nodes, number of analyzed genomes). We rigorously assessed the network stability and structural integrity using topological metrics and statistical tests. Results demonstrate that RF integration significantly broadens GenPPi's predictive power. Application to the Buchnera aphidicola genome revealed an overlap of up to 62% with interactions documented in the STRING database, validating prediction accuracy. Analysis of the RIS algorithm showed that while introducing some randomness, critical node identification remains robust, particularly for Top N values [&ge;] 100, indicating that the edge reduction does not significantly compromise network integrity. In conclusion, combining Machine Learning and RIS represents a significant advancement. GenPPi 1.5 overcomes the high-similarity dependency while efficiently handling complex genomes, providing a robust and scalable alignment-free solution for PPI prediction. GenPPi is available at https://genppi.facom.ufu.br/ and on GitHub: https://github.com/santosardr/genppi and allows users to train custom models for specific genomic contexts.

**Abstract:**
Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is a promising means to combat drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Infection by phage can select for mutations in bacterial populations that confer resistance against phage infection. However, resistance against phage can yield evolutionary trade-offs of biomedical relevance. Here we report the discovery that infection by certain staphylococcal phages sensitizes different strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to {beta}-lactams, a class of antibiotics against which MRSA is typically resistant. MRSA cells that survive infection by these phages display significant reductions in minimal inhibitory concentration against different {beta}-lactams compared to uninfected bacteria. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that these evolved MRSA strains possess highly modulated transcriptional profiles, where numerous genes involved in S. aureus virulence were downregulated. Phage-treated MRSA exhibited attenuated virulence phenotypes in the form of reduced hemolysis and clumping. Despite sharing similar phenotypes, whole-sequencing analysis revealed that the different MRSA strains evolved unique genetic profiles during infection. These results suggest complex evolutionary trajectories in MRSA during phage predation and open up new possibilities to reduce drug resistance and virulence in MRSA infections.

**Abstract:**
Intravital microscopy (IVM) enables live imaging of animals at single-cell resolution, offering essential insights into cancer progression. This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological and dynamic single cell features. BEHAV3D-TP is user-friendly and integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data without advanced computational expertise. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.

**Abstract:**
Caveolin is a monotopic integral membrane protein, widely expressed in metazoa and responsible for constructing enigmatic membrane invaginations known as caveolae. Recently, the high-resolution structure of a purified human caveolin assembly, the CAV1-8S complex, revealed a unique organization of 11 protomers arranged in a tightly packed, radially symmetric spiral disc. One face and the outer rim of this disc are hydrophobic, suggesting that the complex incorporates into membranes by displacing hundreds of lipids from one leaflet. The feasibility of this unique molecular architecture and its biophysical and functional consequences are currently unknown. Using Langmuir film balance measurements, we find that CAV1-8S is highly surface active, intercalating into lipid monolayers of various compositions. CAV1-8S can also incorporate into preformed bilayers, but only upon removal of phospholipids from the outer-facing leaflet. Atomistic and coarse-grained simulations of biomimetic bilayers support this  leaflet replacement model and also reveal that CAV1-8S accumulates 40-70 cholesterol molecules into a disordered monolayer between the complex and its distal lipid leaflet. We find that CAV1-8S preferentially associates with positively curved membrane surfaces due to its influence on the conformations of distal leaflet lipids, and that these effects laterally sort lipids. Large-scale simulations of multiple caveolin assemblies confirmed their association with large, positively curved membrane morphologies consistent with the shape of caveolae. Further, association with curved membranes regulates the exposure of caveolin residues implicated in protein-protein interactions. Altogether, the unique structure of CAV1-8S imparts unusual modes of membrane interaction with implications for membrane organization, morphology, and physiology.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECaveolae are membrane invaginations heavily implicated in cellular physiology and disease; however, how their unique shape and function are produced remains enigmatic. Here, following on recent characterization of the unusual structure of the CAV1-8S oligomer, we examine the molecular details of its interactions with its surrounding lipid membrane using simulations and reconstitution experiments. We describe a novel mode of membrane interaction-which we term  leaflet replacement-for the CAV1-8S complex that has not previously been observed for any other protein. The biophysical consequences of this unique molecular organization provide mechanistic insights into the functions and organization of caveolae in cells.

**Abstract:**
We propose a learning architecture that allows symbolic control and guidance
in reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. We introduce SymDQN, a
novel modular approach that augments the existing Dueling Deep Q-Networks
(DuelDQN) architecture with modules based on the neuro-symbolic framework of
Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs). The modules guide action policy learning and
allow reinforcement learning agents to display behaviour consistent with
reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed
on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a
5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated
with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal
behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape
recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly
improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent.
The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities
of combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.

**Abstract:**
Mycobacterium tuberculosis when phagocytosed by macrophages is not cleared completely and many of the bacteria remain in phagosomes indefinitely. In this study we considered abnormal retention of filamentous actin on early phagosomes contributing to defective phagosome acidification. The actin depolymerizing protein cofilin1 was found downregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Also, phosphocofilin1, the inactive form of cofilin1, which leads to retention of filamentous actin, and the total filamentous actin itself were found upregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Over expression of constitutively active cofilin1 in macrophages was found to decrease the level of filamentous actin and increase phagosome acidification when infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. The anticancer drug sorafenib which activates cofilin1 in PI3K dependent manner was also found to decrease the filamentous actin level and increase phagosome acidification. Cofilin1, known to be positively regulated by superoxide was found to be downregulated by ESAT-6 of M. tuberculosis where the latter is known to reduce ROS in macrophages. Ectopic expression of ESAT-6 in macrophages was found to downregulate cofilin1, increase filamentous actin and to transform the macrophages more spindle shaped. ESAT-6 was also found to decrease phagosome acidification in macrophages infected with an avirulent M. tuberculosis strain. Finally, this study proposes a role for the amino acid methionine in resisting ROS by creating M93 mutants of ESAT-6.

## Ancient Trans-Species Polymorphism at the Major Histocompatibility Complex in Primates

**Abstract:**
Classical genes within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are responsible for peptide presentation to T cells, thus playing a central role in immune defense against pathogens. These genes are subject to strong selective pressures including both balancing and directional selection, resulting in exceptional genetic diversity--thousands of alleles per gene in humans. Moreover, some allelic lineages appear to be shared between primate species, a phenomenon known as trans-species polymorphism (TSP) or incomplete lineage sorting, which is rare in the genome overall. However, despite the clinical and evolutionary importance of MHC diversity, we currently lack a full picture of primate MHC evolution. In particular, we do not know to what extent genes and allelic lineages are retained across speciation events. To start addressing this gap, we explore variation across genes and species in our companion paper (Fortier and Pritchard, 2025) and here we explore variation within individual genes. We used Bayesian phylogenetic methods to determine the extent of TSP at 17 MHC genes, including classical and non-classical Class I and Class II genes. We find strong support for ancient TSP in 7 of 10 classical genes, including--remarkably--between humans and old-world monkeys in MHC-DQB1. In addition to the long-term persistence of ancient lineages, we additionally observe rapid evolution at nucleotides encoding the proteins' peptide-binding domains. The most rapidly-evolving amino acid positions are extremely enriched for autoimmune and infectious disease associations. Together, these results suggest complex selective forces--arising from differential peptide binding--that drive short-term allelic turnover within lineages while also maintaining deeply divergent lineages for at least 31 million years in some cases.

**Abstract:**
Sensorimotor computations for learning and behavior rely on precise patterns of synaptic connectivity. Yet, we typically lack the synaptic wiring diagrams for long-range connections between sensory and motor circuits in the brain. Here we provide the synaptic wiring diagram for sensorimotor circuits involved in learning and production of male zebra finch song, a natural and ethologically relevant behavior. We examined the functional synaptic connectivity from the 4 main sensory afferent pathways onto the 3 known classes of projection neurons of the song premotor cortical region HVC. Recordings from hundreds of identified projection neurons reveal rules for monosynaptic connectivity and the existence of polysynaptic ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in HVC. Circuit tracing further identifies novel connections between HVCs presynaptic partners. Our results indicate a modular organization of ensemble-like networks for integrating long-range input with local circuits, providing important context for information flow and computations for learned vocal behavior.

**Abstract:**
The immediate social context critically modulates drug consumption. The presence of an unfamiliar conspecific, naive to the drug, at the time of consumption reduces cocaine self-administration in male rats during short-access sessions, as well as drug intake in human cocaine users. The subthalamic nucleus (STN), a brain structure involved in cocaine addiction and limbic processes, has been proposed to mediate such social influence on this limited level of drug intake. Whether this influence extends to escalated drug consumption remains an open question. In this study, we compared the effect of the presence of an unfamiliar peer, naive to cocaine, on cocaine self-administration in rats having been exposed to either short (2h) or long-access sessions (6h). We showed that the presence of the peer drastically reduced both limited and escalated cocaine intake in males, while it had no effect on females during short-access sessions. Assessing the effect of STN photo-inhibition or high frequency (HF) stimulation in male rats, we demonstrated that it had no effect in the absence of the conspecific in short-access sessions, STN photo-manipulation suppressed the influence of the peer presence. Moreover, STN photo-inhibition and HF stimulation decreased drug consumption in long-access sessions, but no additive effect was observed when associated with the peer presence, confirming an overriding effect of STN manipulation. Taken together, these results highlight the potential influence of socially oriented manipulations on cocaine intake and further position the STN as a critical mediator of the effect of social presence on addictive-like behaviors.

**Abstract:**
Objective To integrate macro-transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing to analyze the differential gene expression between primary and brain metastatic breast cancer cells, as well as between active and dormant cancer cells within brain metastases, exploring their adaptation and remodeling abilities at different stages of brain metastasis. Methods Four public datasets were used: three mRNA microarray datasets from breast cancer and brain metastasis tissues, and one single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from active and dormant brain metastatic cells. Gene differential expression, pathway enrichment, and cell clustering analyses were performed to compare primary and metastatic breast cancer cells, as well as active and dormant cells in brain metastases, focusing on gene expression, metabolic pathways, and functional pathways. Results Metastatic breast cancer cells showed weakened pathways related to the extracellular matrix and protein digestion. Active cells exhibited enhanced cell cycle regulation, tumor proliferation, and hypoxia resistance pathways compared to dormant cells. Clustering analysis revealed that cluster 6, unique to dormant cells, had enhanced functions in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen formation, tumor inflammation siganure (TIS), and IL-10 signaling. Cluster 3 and 4 in active cells had enhanced DNA replication and tumor proliferation pathways, respectively. Conclusion This study highlights the role of cancer cell characteristics and heterogeneity in the invasiveness of brain metastasis. Understanding these mechanisms can guide the development of more effective treatment strategies for breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) patients.

## Mu and delta opioid receptor antagonists increase the expression of social conditioned place preference in early adolescent mice

**Abstract:**
RationaleSocial behaviors undergo dramatic changes during adolescence, enabling the development of adult social abilities. These changes are intricately linked to the development of the brain reward system and the activity of endogenous opioid signaling. However, the involvement of the opioid system in the development of social behaviors still raises more questions than answers.

ObjectivesHere, we investigated the role of the endogenous opioid system in the rewarding effects of social contact in early and late adolescent male mice.

MethodsSocial reward was assessed using the social conditioned place preference task in early adolescent (~34 days old) and late adolescent (~41 days old) male mice that received a single dose of the selective opioid receptor antagonists cyprodime (1 mg/kg, i.p.), naltrindole (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or norbinaltorphimine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) before the preference posttest.

ResultsThe administration of cyprodime or naltrindole before the posttest significantly increased the preference for the social-conditioned context in early but not late adolescent mice. In contrast, pretreatment with norbinaltorphimine had no effect on context preference.

ConclusionsOur findings support a modified version of the state-dependent mu-opioid receptor model of social behavior, where the effects of opioid ligands are not reversed during development but rather weaken or disappear with age. Furthermore, the results indicate that interactions with siblings in early adolescent mice are motivated by negative reinforcement, whereas those in late adolescence are motivated by positive reinforcement.

**Abstract:**
The dopaminergic system has been extensively studied for its role in behavior in animals as well as human neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases. However, we still know little about how dopamine levels are tightly regulated in vivo. To identify novel regulators of dopamine, we utilized Drosophila melanogaster cuticle pigmentation as a readout, where dopamine is a precursor to melanin. We measured dopamine from genes known to be critical for cuticle pigmentation and performed an RNAi-based screen to identify new regulators of pigmentation. We found 153 potential pigmentation genes, which were enriched for conserved homologs and disease- associated genes as well as developmental signaling pathways and mitochondria-associated proteins. From 35 prioritized candidates, we found 10 caused significant reduction in head dopamine levels and one caused an increase. Two genes, clueless and mask (multiple ankyrin repeats single KH domain), upon knockdown, reduced dopamine levels in the brain. Further examination suggests that Mask regulates the transcription of the rate-limiting dopamine synthesis enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase, and its knockdown causes dopamine-dependent sleep phenotypes. In summary, by studying genes that affect cuticle pigmentation, a phenotype seemingly unrelated to the nervous system, we were able to identify several genes that affect dopamine metabolism as well as a novel regulator of behavior.

## Growth directions and stiffness across cell layers determine whether tissues stay smooth or buckle

**Abstract:**
From smooth shapes to buckles, nature exhibits organs of various shapes and forms. How cells grow to produce smooth shaped leaves and sepals remain unclear. Here, we show that growth along the longitudinal axis during early developmental stages and comparable stiffness across both epidermal layers of Arabidopsis sepals are essential for smoothness, as seen in the wild type. We identified a mutant (as2-7D) with ectopic expression of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) on the outer epidermis. Our analysis reveals that ectopic AS2 expression causes the outer epidermis of as2-7D sepals to buckle during early stages of sepal development. We show that buckling of the outer epidermis occurs due to conflicting cell growth directions and unequal tissue stiffness across the epidermal layers. Overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor Kip-related protein 1 (KRP1) in as2-7D restores sepal smoothness by aligning the growth directions of the outer epidermal cells along the longitudinal axis, while also increasing the overall stiffness of the outer epidermis. Furthermore, buckling is associated with the convergence of auxin efflux transporter protein PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) to generate outgrowth in the sepals at later stages, suggesting that buckling can initiate outgrowths. Our findings suggest that in addition to molecular cues influencing tissue mechanics, tissue mechanics can also modulate molecular signals, giving rise to well-defined shapes.

One-Sentence SummaryThe asymmetric leaves 2-7D mutant sepals buckle due to discoordination of growth between the two epidermal layers.

**Abstract:**
Glioblastoma is the deadliest brain cancer, characterized by large cellular diversity whose complexity and organizing principles are only starting to be uncovered. Both neurodevelopment-like and mesenchymal-like cell states have been described in glioblastoma1-8, with the latter being strongly implicated in malignancy and disease progression8-11. However, the nature of these mesenchymal-like cell states remains unresolved. Here, we performed deep single-cell RNA sequencing of rare glioblastoma cases where tissue could be sampled from tumor core to macroscopically normal cortex. We discovered that previously defined mesenchymal-like tumor cell states instead represented a wound response that was shared across both malignant and non-malignant cell types and was spatially confined to the tumor bulk. Using glioblastoma organoids, we showed that the wound response transcriptional state could be reversibly induced in vitro by hypoxia and human plasma. We used multiplex single-molecule spatial transcriptomics12 on a large patient cohort to show that the activation of wound response states was associated with hypoxia, and organized by distance to perivascular niches. Our findings help reconceptualize the cellular landscape of glioblastoma, wherein a reactive wound-response tissue state shared by all cells in the tumor bulk is superimposed on a fundamentally neurodevelopmental and glial tumor.

**Abstract:**
Individuals with Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB), a rare genetic skin disease characterised by loss of function mutations in the Laminin332 (Lam332), do not survive beyond their first birthday. Here we report that loss of Lam332 leads to absence of cholesterol lipid from the epidermis in vitro and in vivo. Using 3D skin equivalents, a JEB mouse model and JEB patient samples we confirmed changes in epidermal lipid synthesis, which was further explored using lipidomics. Cholesterol biosynthesis genes were increased with loss of Laminin-332 in vitro, however a decrease in immunofluorescence lipid staining was observed. Cholesterol transport in Laminin-332 knockdown keratinocytes was revealed to be disrupted, which in keratinocytes is dependent on the actomyosin network. In conclusion these findings suggest a role for the basement membrane protein Laminin-332 in lipid metabolism in the skin, and a broader role for epidermal homeostasis and barrier formation. Restoration of cholesterol transport in epidermal keratinocytes of JEB patients offers the potential to improve their skin barrier.

## Resting-state is not enough: alpha and mu rhythms change shape across development, but lack diagnostic sensitivity

**Abstract:**
In the human brain, the alpha rhythm in occipital cortex and the mu rhythm in sensorimotor cortex are among the most prominent rhythms, with both rhythms functionally implicated in gating modality-specific information. Separation of these rhythms is non-trivial due to the spatial mixing of these oscillations in sensor space. Using a computationally efficient processing pipeline requiring no manual data cleaning, we isolated alpha and/or mu rhythms from electroencephalography recordings performed on 1605 children aged 5-18. Using the extracted time series for each rhythm, we characterized the waveform shape on a cycle-by-cycle basis and examined whether and how the waveform shape differs across development. We demonstrate that alpha and mu rhythms both exhibit nonsinusoidal waveform shape that changes significantly across development, in addition to the known large changes in oscillatory frequency. This dataset also provided an opportunity to assess oscillatory measures for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found no differences in the resting-state features of these alpha-band rhythms for either ADHD or ASD in comparison to typically developing participants in this dataset. While waveform shape is ignored by traditional Fourier spectral analyses, these nonsinusoidal properties may be informative for building more constrained generative models for different types of alpha-band rhythms, yielding more specific insight into their generation.

**Abstract:**
Cortical activity results from the interplay between network-connected regions that integrate information and stimulus-driven processes originating from sensory motor networks responding to specific tasks. Separating the information due to each of these components has been challenging, and the relationship as measured by fMRI in each of these cases Rest (network) and Task (stimulus-driven) remains a significant outstanding question in the study of large-scale brain dynamics. In this study, we develop a network ordinary differential equation (ODE) model using advanced system identification tools to analyze fMRI data from both rest and task conditions. We demonstrate that task-specific ODEs are essentially a subset of rest-specific ODEs across four different tasks from the Human Connectome Project. By assuming that task activity is a relative complement of rest activity, our model significantly improves predictions of reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis, leading to a 9 % increase in explanatory power (R2) across the 14 subtasks tested. We have additionally shown that these results hold for predicting missing trials and accuracy on a per individual basis as well as classifying Tasks trajectories or resulting dynamic Task functional connectivity. Our findings establish the principle of the Active Cortex Model, which posits that the cortex is always active and that Rest State encompasses all processes, while certain subsets of processes get elevated to perform specific task computations. Thus, this study is an important milestone in the development of the fMRI equation - to causally link large-scale brain activity, brain structural connectivity, and behavioral variables within a single framework.

**Abstract:**
The ocean acts as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and resulting in substantial uptake of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. As biological processes in the oceans such as net primary production (NPP) contribute significantly to this sink, understanding how they will shift in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 is necessary to project future ocean carbon storage capacity. Macronutrient and micronutrient resource limitation within the oceans regulates NPP, and while some micronutrients such as zinc (Zn) are present at very low concentrations, their ability to limit NPP has remained unclear. Zn is a key micronutrient used by phytoplankton for a multitude of metabolic functions, yet there have been few observations of its influence on natural oceanic phytoplankton populations. In this study, we observed Zn limitation of growth in the natural phytoplankton community of Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, in addition to primary iron (Fe) limitation. Shipboard incubation experiments amended with Zn and Fe resulted in significantly higher chlorophyll a content and dissolved inorganic carbon drawdown compared to Fe addition alone. Zn and Fe stress response proteins detected in incubation and environmental biomass provided independent verification of algal co-stress for these micronutrients. We consider total biomass and low surface ocean pCO2 as potential drivers of environmental Zn stress. This study definitively establishes that Zn limitation can occur in the modern oceans, opening up new possibility space in our understanding of nutrient regulation of NPP through geologic time, and we consider the future of oceanic Zn limitation in the face of climate change.

**Abstract:**
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is typically treated empirically with vancomycin, with therapy later tailored based on susceptibility results. However, these tests occur before vancomycin exposure and do not account for adaptation during empiric treatment that can alter S. aureus' susceptibility to first-line drugs. To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU, impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes. Our findings suggest a probabilistic approach to antimicrobial therapy, advocating for rapid genomic diagnostics alongside susceptibility testing to better anticipate and respond to evolutionary changes.

**Abstract:**
Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have demonstrated robust induction of neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T cell activation, however CD8+ responses are variable, and the duration of immunity and protection against variants are limited. Here we repurposed our DNA origami vaccine nanotechnology, DoriVac, for targeting infectious viruses, namely SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and Ebola. The DNA origami nanoparticle, conjugated with infectious-disease-specific heptad repeat 2 (HR2) peptides, which act as highly conserved antigens, and CpG adjuvant at precise nanoscale spacing, induced neutralizing antibodies, Th1 CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in naive mice, with significant improvement over a bolus control. Pre-clinical studies using lymph-node-on-a-chip systems validated that DoriVac, when conjugated with antigenic peptides or proteins, induced promising cellular and humoral immune responses in human cells. Moreover, DoriVac bearing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein achieved immune responses comparable to current mRNA vaccine platforms while potentially reducing storage constraints. These results suggest that DoriVac holds potential as a versatile, modular vaccine platform, capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immunities, underscoring its potential utility in addressing future pandemics.

**Abstract:**
Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker Brainstem Thalamus Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking activity upon multi-whisker stimulation, resembling the stable response pattern observed in barrels. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions.

**Abstract:**
Insulator proteins act as a barrier of enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs). The main insulator protein in vertebrates is CTCF, a DNA-binding protein (DBP). However, other DBPs associated with insulators of EPIs are still unclear. Hence, we developed a systematic, comprehensive deep learning-based approach for identifying the DNA motifs of DBPs associated with insulators. We discovered 97 directional and minor nondirectional motifs in human fibroblast cells that corresponded to 23 DBPs related to insulator function, CTCF, and/or other types of chromosomal transcriptional regulation reported in previous studies. The estimated CTCF orientation bias was consistently proportional to CTCF orientation bias observed in chromatin interactions. The motifs were significantly more abundant at insulator sites separated by repressive and active regions, at boundary sites identified by chromatin interaction data, and at splice sites than other DBPs. For instance, we found that the key regulator MyoD-binding site is located at an insulator site near a gene involved in skeletal muscle differentiation and function. Finally, the insulator-pairing model explains that homologous and heterologous insulator-insulator pairing interactions are orientation-dependent. These findings contribute to elucidate novel transcriptional regulations.

**Abstract:**
Sequence-specific interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with genomic DNA underlie many cellular processes. High-throughput in vitro binding assays coupled with machine learning have made it possible to accurately define such molecular recognition in a biophysically interpretable way for hundreds of TFs across many structural families, providing new avenues for predicting how the sequence preference of a TF is impacted by disease-associated mutations in its DNA binding domain. We developed a method based on a reference-free tetrahedral representation of variation in base preference within a given structural family that can be used to accurately predict the effect of mutations in the protein sequence of the TF. Using the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain families as test cases, our results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately predicting the shifts ({Delta}{Delta}{Delta}G/RT) in binding free energy associated with TF mutants by leveraging high-quality DNA binding models for sets of homologous wild-type TFs.

**Abstract:**
KvS proteins are voltage-gated potassium channel subunits that form functional channels when assembled into heteromers with Kv2.1 (KCNB1) or Kv2.2 (KCNB2). Mammals have 10 KvS subunits: Kv5.1 (KCNF1), Kv6.1 (KCNG1), Kv6.2 (KCNG2), Kv6.3 (KCNG3), Kv6.4 (KCNG4), Kv8.1 (KCNV1), Kv8.2 (KCNV2), Kv9.1 (KCNS1), Kv9.2 (KCNS2), and Kv9.3 (KCNS3). Electrically excitable cells broadly express channels containing Kv2 subunits and most neurons have substantial Kv2 conductance. However, whether KvS subunits contribute to these conductances has not been clear, leaving the physiological roles of KvS subunits poorly understood. Here, we identify that two potent Kv2 inhibitors, used in combination, can distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers and Kv2-only channels. We find that Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, or Kv9-containing channels are resistant to the Kv2-selective pore-blocker RY785 yet remain sensitive to the Kv2-selective voltage sensor modulator guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX). Using these inhibitors in mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons, we find predominantly RY785-sensitive conductances consistent with channels composed entirely of Kv2 subunits. In contrast, RY785-resistant but GxTX-sensitive conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels predominate in mouse and human dorsal root ganglion neurons. These results establish an approach to pharmacologically distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers from Kv2-only channels, enabling investigation of the physiological roles of endogenous KvS subunits. These findings suggest that drugs which distinguish KvS subunits could modulate electrical activity of subsets of Kv2-expressing cell types.

**Abstract:**
Endolysins are highly evolved bacteriophage-encoded lytic enzymes produced to damage the bacterial cell wall for phage progeny release. They offer promising potential as highly specific lytic proteins with a low chance of bacterial resistance. The diversity in lysin sequences and domain organization can be staggering. In silico analysis of bacteriophage and prophage genomes can help identify endolysins exhibiting unique features and high antibacterial activity, hence feeding the pipeline of narrow-spectrum protein antibiotics. Mycobacteriophage lysis cassettes mostly have two lytic enzymes, LysinA and LysinB. The enzyme LysinA targets peptidoglycan in the cell wall and possesses a modular architecture. LysinB typically contains a single domain and acts upon the mycolyl ester linkages in mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (Payne et al., 2010). This study aimed to find novel LysinBs against Mycobacterium fortuitum. After a detailed in silico characterization of lysis cassettes from three M. fortuitum prophages, we chose to work on a LysinB (hereafter described as LysinB_MF) found in an incomplete prophage (phiE1336, 9.4 kb in strain E1336). LysinB_MF showed low sequence similarity with any other endolysins in the database and formed a separate clade on phylogenetic analysis. LysinB_MFs structure, extracted from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, demonstrated a modular architecture with two structurally distinct domains: a peptidoglycan-binding domain (PGBD) at the N-terminal and the characteristic alpha/beta hydrolase domain connected via a linker peptide. We found the alpha/beta hydrolase domain, which is the enzyme-active domain (EAD), contains the conserved Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad with a tunnel-like topology and forms intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The PGBD shows structural similarity to the cell-wall binding domain of an amidase from Clostridium acetobutylicum, hinting at its acquisition due to domain mobility. Our in silico electrostatic potential analysis suggested that PGBD might be essential to the enzyme activity. Based on our analysis, PGBD emerged as an integral constituent of enzymes with diverse functional properties and is predicted to be conserved cross-kingdom. Overall, this study highlights the importance of mining mycobacterial prophages as a novel endolysin source. It also provides unique insights into the diverse architecture of mycobacteriophage-encoded endolysins and the importance of functional domains for their catalytic activities.

**Abstract:**
Kinases are a diverse group of enzymes that use ATP to phosphorylate a variety of substrates. Protein kinases evolved in eukaryotes as important mediators of cell signalling that target specific amino acid side chains to modulate downstream protein function. Among them, the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) are a family of intracellular protein kinases that form signalling cascades responding to a number of stimuli, that control fundamental mechanisms such as proliferation, differentiation, inflammation and cell death. Signals propagate through consecutive kinases which eventually phosphorylate and activate a MAPK. Here, we show that the dual specificity threonine/tyrosine MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks or MEKs) are able to phosphorylate and activate their substrate MAPKs using ADP as well as ATP in vitro. As the pathways are involved in the stress response, we speculate that it would represent an advantage to be able to maintain signalling under conditions such as hypoxia, that occur under a number of cell stresses, including cancer and atherosclerosis, where the available pool of ATP could be depleted.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundFocused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging non-invasive technique for neuromodulation in the central nervous system (CNS). Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) leverages ultrafast Power Doppler Imaging (PDI) to detect changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV), which correlate well with neuronal activity and thus hold promise to monitor brain responses to FUS.

ObjectiveInvestigate the immediate and short-term effects of transcranial FUS neuromodulation in the brain with fUSI by characterizing hemodynamic responses.

MethodsWe designed a setup that aligns a FUS transducer with a linear array to allow immediate subsequent monitoring of the hemodynamic response with fUSI during and after FUS neuromodulation (FUS-fUSI) in lightly anesthetized mice. We investigated the effects of varying pressures and transducer positions on the hemodynamic responses.

ResultsWe found that higher FUS pressures increase the size of the activated brain area, as well as the magnitude of change in CBV and could show that sham sonications did not produce hemodynamic responses. Unilateral sonications resulted in bilateral hemodynamic changes with a significantly stronger response on the ipsilateral side. FUS neuromodulation in mice with a cranial window showed distinct activation patterns that were frequency-dependent and different from the activation patterns observed in the transcranial model.

ConclusionfUSI is hereby shown capable of transcranially monitoring online and short-term hemodynamic effects in the brain during and following FUS neuromodulation.

**Abstract:**
Most thyroid cancer deaths are attributed to a subset of poorly differentiated, metastatic tumors. To improve treatment options for these aggressive thyroid cancers, we developed a novel thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR)-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell therapy, which demonstrated antigen-specific activation and antitumor efficacy against TSHR-overexpressing cell lines in vitro and in vivo. However, de-differentiated thyroid cancers downregulate TSHR. We therefore developed a potent treatment strategy by combining our novel TSHR-CART cells with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, which redifferentiate thyroid tumors and upregulate TSHR expression. In patient-derived anaplastic thyroid cancer xenografts, combination therapy of TSHR-CART cells and MAPK inhibitors led to increased TSHR expression on the tumor tissue and significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy and prolonged survival compared to TSHR-CART monotherapy.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEPoor target selection and antigen escape limit CART cell efficacy in solid tumors. We developed TSHR-CART cells to treat differentiated thyroid cancers but observed TSHR downregulation in dedifferentiated thyroid cancers. We found that MAPK inhibitors restored TSHR expression and sensitized these cancers to TSHR-CART cell therapy.

**Abstract:**
Task errors are used to learn and refine motor skills. We investigated how task assistance influences learned neural representations using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), which map neural activity into movement via a decoder. We analyzed motor cortex activity as monkeys practiced BCI with a decoder that adapted to improve or maintain performance over days. Over time, task-relevant information became concentrated in fewer neurons, unlike with fixed decoders. At the population level, task information also became largely confined to a few neural modes that accounted for an unexpectedly small fraction of the population variance. A neural network model suggests the adaptive decoders directly contribute to forming these more compact neural representations. Our findings show that assistive decoders manipulate error information used for long-term learning computations like credit assignment, which informs our understanding of motor learning and has implications for designing real-world BCIs.

**Abstract:**
Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) are well validated antimicrobial targets, but the prevalence of {beta}-lactamase driven resistance and, more rarely, target-based mutations, necessitates new classes of PBP-targeting drugs. Here we describe the discovery and optimisation of novel, bicyclic peptide (Bicycle(R)) inhibitors of E. coli PBP3 (EcPBP3) using a proprietary phage display platform, and their conjugation to linear antimicrobial peptides to confer outer membrane permeation. These molecules exhibited high-affinity binding to E. coli PBP3 and a viable spectrum of killing activity against clinically relevant species of the Enterobacterales. X-ray crystallography was used to explore the mode of binding to PBP3, enabling increased target affinity and improvement of in vitro stability. These compounds bind to the transpeptidase active site cleft of PBP3 and represent a novel non-{beta}-lactam chemical class of high affinity, non-covalent penicillin binding protein inhibitors.

## SMAdd-seq: Probing chromatin accessibility with small molecule DNA intercalation and nanopore sequencing

**Abstract:**
Studies of in vivo chromatin organization have relied on the accessibility of the underlying DNA to nucleases or methyltransferases, which is limited by their requirement for purified nuclei and enzymatic treatment. Here, we introduce a nanopore-based sequencing technique called Small-Molecule Adduct sequencing (SMAdd-seq), where we profile chromatin accessibility by treating nuclei or intact cells with a small molecule, angelicin. Angelicin reacts with thymine bases in linker DNA not bound to core nucleosomes after UV light exposure, thereby labeling accessible DNA regions. By applying SMAdd-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that angelicin-modified DNA can be detected by its distinct nanopore current signals. To systematically identify angelicin modifications and analyze chromatin structure, we developed a neural network model, NEural network for mapping MOdifications in nanopore long-reads (NEMO). NEMO accurately called expected nucleosome occupancy patterns near transcription start sites at both bulk and single-molecule levels. We observe heterogeneity in chromatin structure and identify clusters of single-molecule reads with varying configurations at specific yeast loci. Furthermore, SMAdd-seq performs equivalently on purified yeast nuclei and intact cells, indicating the promise of this method for in vivo chromatin labeling on long single molecules to measure native chromatin dynamics and heterogeneity.

**Abstract:**
Understanding how the eyes, head, and hands coordinate in natural contexts is a critical challenge in visuomotor coordination research, often constrained by sedentary or restricted tasks and cued actions. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment where participants self-generated pick-and-place actions in a virtual environment, recording concurrent gaze and body movements. Subjects exhibited intricate translation and rotation movements of the eyes, head, and hands during the task. We employed time-dependent principal component analysis to study the relationship between the movements of the eyes, head, and hands relative to action onset. We reduced the overall dimensionality into 2D representations, capturing up to 65\% of the movement variance just in time with the actions. Our analysis revealed the eyes synchronized with the head and hands close to action onset, with variations in coupling observed in horizontal and vertical planes, indicating distinct mechanisms for coordination in the brain. Crucially, the head and hands remained tightly coupled throughout the observation period, suggesting a shared neural code driving these effectors. Notably, the low-dimensional representations of the eye-head-hand movement vectors showed maximum predictive accuracy of the upcoming action location ~200 ms before onset, highlighting just-in-time coordination among the three effectors. Furthermore, predictive accuracy was significantly influenced by the location of the upcoming action. Our study emphasizes differential visuomotor control shaped by task structure, providing insights into the dynamic interplay of eye, head, and hand movements during natural behavior.

Neural processing of sensory information takes time. Consequently, to estimate the current state of the world, the brain must rely on predictive processes - for example, extrapolating the motion of a ball to determine its probable present position. Some evidence implicates early (pre-cortical) processing in extrapolation, but it remains unclear whether extrapolation continues during later-stage (cortical) processing, where further delays accumulate. Moreover, the majority of such evidence relies on invasive neurophysiological techniques in animals, with accurate characterisation of extrapolation effects in the human brain currently lacking. Here, we address these issues by demonstrating how precise probabilistic maps can be constructed from human EEG recordings. Participants (N = 18, 2 sessions) viewed a stimulus moving along a circular trajectory while EEG was recorded. Using LDA classification, we extracted maps of stimulus location over time and found evidence of a forwards temporal shift occurring across temporally distinct processing stages. This accelerated emergence of position representations indicates extrapolation occurring at multiple stages of processing, with representations progressively shifted closer to real-time. We further show evidence of representational overshoot during early-stage processing following unexpected changes to an objects trajectory, and demonstrate that the observed dynamics can emerge without supervision in a simulated neural network via spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

**Abstract:**
Improvements in single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) assays have enabled detailed characterization of somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) at the single-cell level. Yet, current computational methods are mostly designed for detecting chromosome-scale changes in cancer samples with low sequencing coverage. Here, we introduce HiScanner (High-resolution Single-Cell Allelic copy Number callER), which combines read depth, B-allele frequency, and haplotype phasing to identify CNAs with high resolution. In simulated data, HiScanner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various CNA types and sizes. When applied to high-coverage scWGS data from 65 cells across 11 neurotypical human brains, HiScanner shows a superior ability to detect smaller CNAs, uncovering distinct CNA patterns between neurons and oligodendrocytes. We also generated low-coverage scWGS data from 179 cells sampled from the same meningioma patient at two time points. For this serial dataset, integration of CNAs with point mutations revealed evolutionary trajectories of tumor cells. These findings show that HiScanner enables accurate characterization of frequency, clonality, and distribution of CNAs at the single-cell level in both non-neoplastic and neoplastic cells.

**Abstract:**
The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural computations to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviors and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep-learning behavioral analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective-motivational behaviors without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic mu-opioid receptor promoter to drive chemogenetic inhibition in opioid-responsive ACC neurons. This targeted neuromodulation recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain. This opioid-mimetic gene therapy offers a new strategy for precision pain management by targeting a key nociceptive cortical circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

**Abstract:**
Bioluminescence is the production of visible light by living organisms. It occurs through the oxidation of a luciferin substrate catalysed by luciferase enzymes. Auxiliary proteins, such as fluorescent proteins and luciferin-binding proteins, can modify the light emitted wavelength or stabilize reactive luciferin molecules, respectively. Additionally, calcium ions are crucial for the luminescence across various species. Despite the large phylogenetic distribution of bioluminescent organisms, only a few systems have been comprehensively studied. Notably, cnidarian species of the Renilla genus utilize a coelenterazine-dependent luciferase, a calcium-dependent coelenterazine-binding protein and a green fluorescent protein. We investigated the bioluminescence of three sea pen species: Pennatula phosphorea, Anthoptilum murrayi and Funiculina quadrangularis (Pennatuloidea, Anthozoa). Their light-emission spectra reveal peaks at 510, 513 and 485 nm, respectively. A coelenterazine-based reaction was demonstrated in all three species. Using transcriptome analyses, we identified predicted transcripts coding for luciferases, green fluorescent proteins and coelenterazine-binding proteins for P. phosphorea and A. murrayi. Immunodetection confirmed the expression of luciferase in P. phosphorea and F. quadrangularis. We also expressed recombinant luciferase of A. murrayi, confirming its activity. We highlighted the role of calcium ions in bioluminescence, possibly associated with the mechanism of substrate release at the level of coelenterazine-binding proteins. The study proposes a model for anthozoan bioluminescence, offering new avenues for future ecological and functional research on these luminous organisms.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundPriming plant immunity offers a powerful and sustainable strategy for crop protection, enabling plants to respond faster and more efficiently to threats. This increased readiness is driven by transcriptional memory--molecular mechanisms that store and recall stress responses, including protein accumulation, transcription factor activity, and epigenetic modifications. However, the interplay among transcriptional stress memory, its stability, and its broader impact on plant resistance remain poorly understood.

ResultsHere, we reveal a tight link between transcriptional memory and defense priming in Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to repeated acoustic stimulations. Using a combination of experiments and computational modeling, we show that enhanced resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum after three stimulations arises from three key mechanisms: (1) preemptive activation of defense pathways in noninoculated plants, (2) increased diversification of defense-related genes, and (3) gene priming. This heightened defense state is sustained by transcriptional stress memory across thousands of genes, which is likely orchestrated by transcription factor cascades.

Challenging the conventional view that priming involves stepwise activation of distinct pathways, our findings suggest that priming instead results from the simultaneous modulation of a broad spectrum of defense pathways. This built-in redundancy enhances resilience, shielding primed plants from the genetic variability-driven resistance loss observed in naive plants. However, this same redundancy imposes strict limits on further enhancing the resistance. More frequent acoustic stimulations did not amplify the protective effect, and transcriptional memory faded within 1.5 days after stimulation ceased.

ConclusionsBy integrating experimental and computational approaches, we present a genome-scale quantitative model of stress-induced gene regulation. Our results highlight the trade-offs inherent in transcriptional memory-driven priming, revealing both its potential and its limitations in optimizing plant immunity.

**Abstract:**
In the canonical interpretation of dopaminergic neuron activity during Pavlovian conditioning, initially cell firing is triggered by unexpected rewards. Upon learning, activation instead follows the reward-predictive conditioned stimulus, and when expected rewards are withheld, firing is inhibited. However, little is known about dopaminergic neuron activity during the actual learning process in operant tasks. Here, we recorded optogenetically identified dopaminergic neurons of ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice training in multiple, successive operant sensory discrimination tasks. A delay between nose-poke choices and trial outcome signals (for reward or punishment) probed for instructional or predictive activity. During training, but prior to criterion performance, firing increased after correct, but not incorrect choices, but prior to outcome signals. Thus, the neurons predicted whether choices would be rewarded, despite the animals subthreshold behavioral performance. Surprisingly, these neurons also fired after reward delivery, as if the rewards had been unexpected according to the canonical view, but activity was inhibited after punishment signals, as if the reward had been expected after all. These inconsistencies suggest revision of theoretical formulations of dopaminergic neuronal activity to embody multiple roles in temporal difference learning and actor-critic models. Furthermore, on training trials when these neurons predicted that a given choice was correct and would be rewarded, surprisingly, the mice adhered to other non-rewarded and untrained task strategies (e.g., alternation). The DA neurons reward prediction activity could serve as critic signals for the choices just made. This consistent with the notion that the brain must reconcile multiple Bayesian belief representations during learning.

Significance statementThe canonical view of dopaminergic function based on classical conditioning studies evokes reward-prediction error (RPE) signaling. Here, in mice performing a series of novel operant tasks with a delay between behavioral responses and reward/punishment signals, some neurons began firing after correct (but not incorrect) responses, but prior to the trial outcome (reward/punishment) signal. Nevertheless, the animals performed at chance levels, employing behavioral strategies other than the one signaled by the neurons. Furthermore, these same neurons showed canonical RPE responses, increased firing after reward signals (interpreted as the reward being unexpected) and firing rate decreases punishment (interpreted as a reward having been expected). These findings indicate that dopaminergic neurons can participate in diverse functions underlying different behavioral strategies for learning.

**Abstract:**
It is vital to understand the genomic basis of differences in ecologically important traits if we are to understand the impact of global change on biodiversity and enhance our ability for targeted intervention. This study explores the potential of a novel genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach for identifying loci underlying quantitative polygenic traits in natural populations, based on phenotypic population means and genome-wide allele frequency data as obtained e.g. by PoolSeq approaches. Extensive population genetic forward simulations demonstrate that the approach is generally effective for oligogenic and moderately polygenic traits and relatively insensitive to low heritability. However, applicability is limited for highly polygenic architectures and pronounced population structure. The required sample size is moderate with very good results being obtained already for a few dozen populations scored. When combined with machine learning for feature selection, the method performs very well in predicting population means. The data efficiency of the method, particularly when using pooled sequencing and bulk phenotyping, makes GWAS studies more accessible for research in biodiversity genomics. Moreover, in a direct comparison to individual based GWAS, the proposed method performed constistently better with regard to the number of true positive loci identified and prediction accuracy. Overall, this study highlights the promise of popGWAS for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in natural populations.

**Abstract:**
Hearing loss is a pervasive global health challenge with profound impacts on communication, cognitive function, and quality of life. Recent studies have established age-related hearing loss as a significant risk factor for dementia, highlighting the importance of hearing loss research. Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), which are electrophysiological recordings of synchronized neural activity from the auditory nerve and brainstem, serve as in vivo readouts for sensory hair cell, synaptic integrity, hearing sensitivity, and other key features of auditory pathway functionality, making them highly valuable for both basic neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics. Despite their utility, traditional ABR analyses rely heavily on subjective manual interpretation, leading to considerable variability and limiting reproducibility across studies. Here, we introduce Auditory Brainstem Response Analyzer (ABRA), a novel open-source graphical user interface powered by deep learning, which automates and standardizes ABR waveform analysis. ABRA employs convolutional neural networks trained on diverse datasets collected from multiple experimental settings, achieving rapid and unbiased extraction of key ABR metrics, including peak amplitude, latency, and auditory threshold estimates. We demonstrate that ABRAs deep learning models provide performance comparable to expert human annotators while dramatically reducing analysis time and enhancing reproducibility across datasets from different laboratories. By bridging hearing research, sensory neuroscience, and advanced computational techniques, ABRA facilitates broader interdisciplinary insights into auditory function. An online version of the tool is available for use at no cost at https://abra.ucsd.edu.

**Abstract:**
Humans are the only species with the ability to convey an unbounded number of novel thoughts by combining words into sentences. This process is guided by complex semantic and abstract syntactic representations. Despite their centrality to human cognition, the neural mechanisms underlying these systems remain obscured by inherent limitations of non-invasive brain measures and a near total focus on comprehension paradigms. Here, we address these limitations with high-resolution neurosurgical recordings (electrocorticography) and a controlled sentence production experiment. We uncover distinct cortical networks encoding word-level, semantic, and syntactic information. These networks are broadly distributed across traditional language areas, but with focal sensitivity to syntactic structure in middle and inferior frontal gyri. In contrast to previous findings from comprehension studies, these networks are largely non-overlapping, each specialized for just one of the three linguistic constructs we investigate. Most strikingly, our data reveal an unexpected property of higher-order linguistic information: it is encoded independent of neural activity levels. We propose that this "magnitude-independent coding" scheme represents a novel mechanism for encoding information, reserved for higher-order cognition more broadly.

**Abstract:**
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Previous studies have reported more than 50 CME accessory proteins; however, the mechanism driving the invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) remains elusive. We show by quantitative live cell imaging that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCDC32, a poorly characterized endocytic accessory protein, leads to the accumulation of unstable flat clathrin assemblies. CCDC32 interacts with the -appendage domain (AD) of AP2 in vitro and with full length AP2 complexes in cells. Deletion of aa78-98 in CCDC32, corresponding to a predicted -helix, abrogates AP2 binding and CCDC32s early function in CME. Furthermore, clinically observed nonsense mutations in CCDC32, which result in C-terminal truncations that lack aa78-98, are linked to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome (CFNDS). Overall, our data demonstrate the function of a novel endocytic accessory protein, CCDC32, in regulating CCP stabilization and invagination, critical early stages of CME.

SummaryWe show that CCDC32, a poorly studied and functionally ambiguous protein, binds to AP2 and regulates CCP stabilization and invagination. Clinically observed mutations in CCDC32 lose their ability to interact with AP2 likely contributing to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome.

**Abstract:**
Molecular convergence, where specific non-synonymous changes in protein-coding genes lead to identical amino acid substitutions across multiple lineages, provides strong evidence of adaptive evolution. Detecting this signal across diverse taxa can reveal broad evolutionary mechanisms that may not be apparent when studying individual lineages. In this study, we search for convergent substitutions in the most speciose group of vertebrates, teleost fishes. Using an unsupervised approach, we detected convergence in 89 protein-coding genes across 143 chromosomal-level genomes. To assess their functional implications, we integrate data on protein properties, gene expression across species and tissues, single-cell RNA sequencing of zebrafish embryonic development, and gene perturbation experiments in zebrafish. The convergent genes were associated with diverse processes including embryonic development, tissue morphogenesis, metabolism, and responses to hormones and heat stress. The convergent substitutions altered amino acid properties, with some occurring at functionally critical sites. Notably, only one-third of these genes were tissue-specific, while the majority were expressed across multiple tissues and cell types. Genetic perturbation data further showed that the convergent genes can affect multiple structures across diverse tissues. These results highlight the pleiotropic nature of the convergent genes. Using an evolutionary modeling approach, we show that adaptive variation tends to accumulate in genes with intermediate pleiotropy, enabling organisms to overcome selective pressures during ecological shifts. Although traditionally considered a source of constraint, we argue that adaptation via genes with intermediate pleiotropy might be particularly advantageous following periods of ecological shifts, and can potentially lead to the evolution of convergent phenotypes.

**Abstract:**
Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures supports long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and home literacy environment, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to second-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop early in infancy but undergo further refinement between birth and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.

## Synergistic reinforcement learning by cooperation of the cerebellum and basal ganglia

**Abstract:**
The cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia are essential for flexible learning in mammals. Although traditionally thought to operate under different learning rules, recent evidence suggests that both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum may employ reinforcement learning mechanisms. This raises the question of how these structures coordinate when a common reward prediction error mechanism is active. To address this issue, we first examined output signals from the basal ganglia and cerebellum following the activity of the cerebral cortex. We recorded single-neuron activity from the output regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia - the cerebellar nuclei (CN) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) - in both male and female ChR2 transgenic rats. Neurons in the CN and SNr exhibited distinct temporal response patterns; notably, the fast excitatory response in the CN, driven by mossy fiber input, was synchronized with the inhibitory response in the SNr, mediated via the direct pathway. Using these experimental findings together with connectome data, we developed both a semi-realistic spiking network model and a reservoir-based reinforcement learning model. In the latter model, successful learning depended on synaptic plasticity in both the cerebellum and basal ganglia with a temporal precision on the order of 10 ms. Furthermore, cortical {beta}-oscillations enhanced learning and optimal reinforcement learning occurred when the output of cerebellar and basal ganglia signal phase-locked at the frequency of cortical oscillation. Taken together, our results suggest that the coordinated output of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, driven by tightly tuned cortical input, underlies brain-wide synergistic reinforcement learning.

Significance StatementThe cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia support learning. Recent research suggests that both the basal ganglia and cerebellum use a similar learning process called reinforcement learning, which involves predicting rewards. To understand how these brain regions work together, we recorded brain activity in rats while photo-stimulating the cerebral cortex. We found that two types of responses in the cerebellum and basal ganglia were synchronized, which might help activate the cerebral cortex. A computer model showed that precise timing of signals from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia is important for learning. This timing was important only when the cerebral cortex worked in a specific frequency range. Our findings suggest that coordinated brain activity enhances learning.

**Abstract:**
De novo protein design represents a fundamental pursuit in protein engineering, yet current deep learning approaches remain constrained by their narrow design scope. Here we present Pinal, a large-scale frontier framework comprising 16 billion parameters and trained on 1.7 billion protein-text pairs, that bridges natural language understanding with protein design space, translating human design intent into novel protein sequences. Instead of a straightforward end-to-end textto-sequence generation, Pinal implements a two-stage process: first generating protein structures based on language instructions, then designing sequences conditioned on both the generated structure and the language input. This strategy effectively constrains the search space by operating in the more tractable structural domain. Through comprehensive computational evaluation, we demonstrate that Pinal achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches, including the concurrent work ESM3, while exhibiting robust generalization to novel protein structures beyond the PDB database. Lastly, we experimentally validated that four out of the eight de novo-designed alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), guided by natural language inputs, exhibited functional activity.

**Abstract:**
High-resolution energetic information about protein conformational ensembles is essential for understanding protein function, yet remains challenging to obtain. We present PIGEON-FEATHER, a method for calculating ensemble free energies of opening ({Delta}Gop) at single- or near-single-amino acid resolution for proteins of all sizes from hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry (HX/MS) data. PIGEON-FEATHER disambiguates and reconstructs all experimentally measured HX/MS isotopic mass envelopes using a Bayesian Monte Carlo sampling approach. We applied PIGEON-FEATHER to reveal how E. coli and human dihydrofolate reductases (ecDHFR, hDHFR) have evolved distinct ensembles. We show how two competitive inhibitors bind these orthologs differently, solving the longstanding mystery of why both therapeutic molecules inhibit hDHFR, but only one inhibits ecDHFR. Extending PIGEON-FEATHER to a large protein-DNA complex, we mapped ligand-induced ensemble reweighting in the E. coli lac repressor to describe the functional switching mechanism crucial for transcriptional regulation.

**Abstract:**
Sensory stimulation of the brain reverberates in its recurrent neural networks. However, current computational models of brain activity do not separate immediate sensory responses from this intrinsic dynamic. We apply a vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX), combining the concepts of "functional connectivity" and "encoding models", to intracranial recordings in humans. This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic. We find that the intrinsic dynamic enhances and prolongs the neural responses to scene cuts, eye movements, and sounds. Failing to account for these extrinsic inputs, leads to spurious recurrent connections that govern the intrinsic dynamic. We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching. The model shows that an external stimulus can reduce intrinsic noise. It also shows that sensory areas have mostly outward, whereas higher-order brain areas mostly incoming connections. We conclude that the response to an external audiovisual stimulus can largely be attributed to the intrinsic dynamic of the brain, already observed during rest.

**Abstract:**
Fasciolosis is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. It is a serious public health and veterinary concern, with significant consequences for both human and livestock populations. An abattoir-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January to September 2023 at Gondar ELFORA Abattoir, Ethiopia, to assess hematobiochemical alterations and pathological lesions induced by fasciolosis in slaughtered cattle. The study involved one hundred apparently healthy male local breed cattle, evenly split into fifty infected and fifty non-infected individuals, using a purposive sampling technique. Findings showed lower mean values for hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), total erythrocyte count (TEC), lymphocytes, monocytes, total protein, albumin, and glucose. Conversely, they had higher mean values for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total leukocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, eosinophils, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Basophil levels were similar in both groups. Liver alterations observed included hepatomegaly with rounded edges and the presence of juvenile flukes in the cut section of the parenchyma. In chronic cases, the liver appeared smaller, with a firm consistency, a corrugated capsule, and dilated bile ducts containing twisted flukes. Microscopically, during the acute phase, there was infiltration of eosinophils, hemosiderin pigmentation, and congestion around the central vein and sinusoids. In contrast, chronic cases exhibited fibrosis, proliferation of bile ducts, and metaplasia of columnar to cuboidal epithelial cells. The results of hematobiochemical alterations were consistent with gross and microscopic findings, indicating a significant impact on liver physiology and histology, leading to substantial losses in meat and milk production.

**Abstract:**
Expansion of a disease-specific tandem repeat is responsible for >45 Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs). The mismatch repair protein PMS2 is a modifier of somatic expansion and disease severity in Huntingtons disease (HD), a RED resulting from a CAG-repeat expansion. However, PMS2 shows different effects in different RED models, protecting against expansion in some and promoting it in others. To better understand this difference, we carried out a systematic study of the loss of PMS2 in mouse models of HD and the fragile X-related disorders (FXDs), a group of REDs resulting from a CGG-repeat expansion. In both models, loss of one Pms2 allele resulted in more expansions, while loss of both alleles resulted in more expansion in some organs but less in others. Thus, rather than reflecting different expansion mechanisms in different diseases, the previously reported differences in different model systems likely reflects the ability of PMS2 to promote expansion in some cellular contexts and to protect against it in others. In mouse embryonic stem cells containing both sets of repeats where PMS2 was expressed under the control of a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible promoter, low DOX concentrations produced a dose-dependent increase in expansions of both repeats, an effect that was dependent on the PMS2 nuclease domain, while higher DOX levels resulted in a decrease in expansions. Our findings have implications both for the mechanism of expansion and for therapeutic approaches to treat these diseases by reducing somatic expansion.

Significance statementExpansion of a disease-specific microsatellite is responsible for >45 Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs). The mismatch repair factor PMS2 has been identified as a genetic modifier of somatic expansion and disease severity in Huntingtons disease (HD). However, loss of PMS2 has different effects in different REDs models. Using mouse and cell models of the fragile X-related disorders and HD, we show that PMS2 has both pro-mutagenic and anti-mutagenic effects in both models depending on the cell type and that an intact nuclease domain is required for its ability to promote expansion. These findings support the idea that the REDs all share a common expansion mechanism and suggests a model for repeat expansion consistent with a dual role for PMS2 in this process.

**Abstract:**
Computational prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding cell biology and drug development, offering a promising alternative to costly and time-consuming experimental methods. While the original GenPPi software represented an advance in ab initio PPI network prediction from bacterial genomes, its reliance on high sequence similarity limited it. In this work, we introduce the GenPPi 1.5 and enhance prediction capabilities. We incorporated a Random Forest (RF) algorithm, trained on 60 biophysical features derived from amino acid propensity indices, to overcome the previous limitation by classifying protein similarity even in low sequence identity scenarios (targeting > 65% identity). Furthermore, to address the computational complexity arising from the increased number of potential interactions generated by the RF model, especially within extensive conserved phylogenetic profiles, we developed and integrated the Reduced Interaction Sampling (RIS) algorithm. RIS stochastically samples interactions within these extensive profiles, optimizing performance for complete genome analysis. Our multifaceted methodology included integrating RF for efficient similarity classification and implementing RIS to reduce the computational burden. We evaluated the effectiveness through extensive simulations across different configurations (operational modes, Top N selected nodes, number of analyzed genomes). We rigorously assessed the network stability and structural integrity using topological metrics and statistical tests. Results demonstrate that RF integration significantly broadens GenPPi's predictive power. Application to the Buchnera aphidicola genome revealed an overlap of up to 62% with interactions documented in the STRING database, validating prediction accuracy. Analysis of the RIS algorithm showed that while introducing some randomness, critical node identification remains robust, particularly for Top N values [&ge;] 100, indicating that the edge reduction does not significantly compromise network integrity. In conclusion, combining Machine Learning and RIS represents a significant advancement. GenPPi 1.5 overcomes the high-similarity dependency while efficiently handling complex genomes, providing a robust and scalable alignment-free solution for PPI prediction. GenPPi is available at https://genppi.facom.ufu.br/ and on GitHub: https://github.com/santosardr/genppi and allows users to train custom models for specific genomic contexts.

**Abstract:**
Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is a promising means to combat drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Infection by phage can select for mutations in bacterial populations that confer resistance against phage infection. However, resistance against phage can yield evolutionary trade-offs of biomedical relevance. Here we report the discovery that infection by certain staphylococcal phages sensitizes different strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to {beta}-lactams, a class of antibiotics against which MRSA is typically resistant. MRSA cells that survive infection by these phages display significant reductions in minimal inhibitory concentration against different {beta}-lactams compared to uninfected bacteria. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that these evolved MRSA strains possess highly modulated transcriptional profiles, where numerous genes involved in S. aureus virulence were downregulated. Phage-treated MRSA exhibited attenuated virulence phenotypes in the form of reduced hemolysis and clumping. Despite sharing similar phenotypes, whole-sequencing analysis revealed that the different MRSA strains evolved unique genetic profiles during infection. These results suggest complex evolutionary trajectories in MRSA during phage predation and open up new possibilities to reduce drug resistance and virulence in MRSA infections.

**Abstract:**
Intravital microscopy (IVM) enables live imaging of animals at single-cell resolution, offering essential insights into cancer progression. This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological and dynamic single cell features. BEHAV3D-TP is user-friendly and integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data without advanced computational expertise. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.

**Abstract:**
Caveolin is a monotopic integral membrane protein, widely expressed in metazoa and responsible for constructing enigmatic membrane invaginations known as caveolae. Recently, the high-resolution structure of a purified human caveolin assembly, the CAV1-8S complex, revealed a unique organization of 11 protomers arranged in a tightly packed, radially symmetric spiral disc. One face and the outer rim of this disc are hydrophobic, suggesting that the complex incorporates into membranes by displacing hundreds of lipids from one leaflet. The feasibility of this unique molecular architecture and its biophysical and functional consequences are currently unknown. Using Langmuir film balance measurements, we find that CAV1-8S is highly surface active, intercalating into lipid monolayers of various compositions. CAV1-8S can also incorporate into preformed bilayers, but only upon removal of phospholipids from the outer-facing leaflet. Atomistic and coarse-grained simulations of biomimetic bilayers support this  leaflet replacement model and also reveal that CAV1-8S accumulates 40-70 cholesterol molecules into a disordered monolayer between the complex and its distal lipid leaflet. We find that CAV1-8S preferentially associates with positively curved membrane surfaces due to its influence on the conformations of distal leaflet lipids, and that these effects laterally sort lipids. Large-scale simulations of multiple caveolin assemblies confirmed their association with large, positively curved membrane morphologies consistent with the shape of caveolae. Further, association with curved membranes regulates the exposure of caveolin residues implicated in protein-protein interactions. Altogether, the unique structure of CAV1-8S imparts unusual modes of membrane interaction with implications for membrane organization, morphology, and physiology.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECaveolae are membrane invaginations heavily implicated in cellular physiology and disease; however, how their unique shape and function are produced remains enigmatic. Here, following on recent characterization of the unusual structure of the CAV1-8S oligomer, we examine the molecular details of its interactions with its surrounding lipid membrane using simulations and reconstitution experiments. We describe a novel mode of membrane interaction-which we term  leaflet replacement-for the CAV1-8S complex that has not previously been observed for any other protein. The biophysical consequences of this unique molecular organization provide mechanistic insights into the functions and organization of caveolae in cells.
