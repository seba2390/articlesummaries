**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
Infectious diseases, also known as communicable disease or transmissible disease is illness that is caused due to pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. One of such infection is caused by zoonotic virus (bat-borne) known as Nipah virus (NiV). NiV is one of the worlds deadliest viruses leading to highest mortality rates. It is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to category C priority pathogen that belongs to genus Hepanivirus, and family Paramyxoviridae. The first occurrence of NiV was observed in Malaysia-Singapore during 1998-1999 and the most recent outbreak in Kozhikode district of Kerala in 2018.

Currently, no drugs or vaccines specific to NiV have proven to yield effective outcome at advanced stage of the disease. However, some therapies involving antiviral drug like Ribavirin along with other medicines have shown to recover patients, reducing the death rate by 36%. Due to extensive research various therapeutic strategies have been proven to successfully target the viral infection during the early stages in animal models. Several vaccines have been under investigation and clinical trials serving as a promising approach towards effective and safe vaccine in both livestock animals and humans.

This study underscores the essential contributions shaping the academic discourse in nipah virus research, bringing to light the most influential studies within the co-citation and co-occurrence network analysis. By identifying the keywords, we gain valuable insights into the foundational research driving advancements in this research area. The detailed mapping of the co-citation network further illuminates the interconnectedness of various research themes and the collaborative efforts that boost the field of nipah virus research in different horizons. The recognition of influential studies not only highlights the depth and breadth of scholarly engagement but also provides a roadmap for future research endeavours.

**Abstract:**
The growing interconnection between human, animal, and environmental health has escalated the need for integrated approaches to public health. The One Health framework addresses this necessity by promoting local, national, and global interdisciplinary collaboration. Population growth, intensive animal farming, and manmade environmental changes contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases of probable animal origin, such as COVID-19. Establishing the Quadripartite collaboration with four multilateral United Nations agencies underscores the increasing recognition of these interdependencies. This scoping review protocol aims to evaluate how One Health studies integrate human, animal, and environmental health, analyzing methodologies, scope, and interdisciplinary collaboration, to identify key achievements, existing gaps, and future research priorities. The projected literature search will include PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Virtual Health Library, Health Systems Evidence, and Social Systems Evidence. Additionally, grey literature will be retrieved from Opengrey, Thesis Commons, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations, by structured electronic search, as well as the first 100 entries in Google Scholar, manually. This protocol proposes to include studies, policies, regulations, strategies, and interventions published from 2004 onwards aimed at the prevention and integrated management of food safety, zoonotic diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and the impacts of climate change on health. No language filters will be applied. Two independent reviewers will analyze titles, abstracts, and full texts to conduct a two-phase review, with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. Data will be retrieved using a standardized data extraction form, and results will be presented in graphic and tabular format, accompanied by a narrative summary, to highlight the achievements of integrated One Health implementation. The expected result is the development of a scoping review protocol to map One Health studies and practices, which effectively integrate the human, animal, and environmental health dimensions applicable globally in public health scenarios.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

**Abstract:**
Despite intensive study, gaps remain in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to limited contextual metadata accompanying most large genomic surveillance datasets. We analyzed over 130,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, over 85,000 with matched epidemiological data, collected in Massachusetts from November 2021 to January 2023, to investigate viral transmission dynamics at high resolution. The data were drawn from diagnostic testing at >600 facilities representing schools, workplaces, public testing, and other sectors, and encompass the emergence of six major viral lineages, each representing a new outbreak. We found urban areas as key hubs for new lineage introduction and interurban transmission as facilitating spread throughout the state. Young adults, especially those on college campuses, served as early indicators of emerging lineage dominance. Resident-aged populations in college campuses and nursing homes exhibited a higher likelihood of being linked to within-facility transmission, while staff-aged at those facilities were more linked to their surrounding community. Individuals with recent vaccine doses, including boosters, had a lower likelihood of initiating transmission. This dataset shows the value of linking genomic and epidemiologic data at scale for higher resolution insights into viral dynamics and their implication for public health strategy.

**Abstract:**
IntroductionPneumonia is a leading cause of under-five mortality, with 30 million annual cases in India. Despite national guidelines, significant barriers to timely and appropriate care-seeking persist. Caregivers often face financial constraints, lack of awareness, mistrust in government facilities, and a preference for non-registered medical practitioners (non-RMP), delaying effective treatment. This study explores care-seeking behaviors, associated sociodemographic factors, and barriers to access to appropriate healthcare for childhood pneumonia in rural India.

MethodsThis study is part of a broader implementation research (IR) initiative and represents its formative phase. This mixed-methods study was conducted in Palwal district, Haryana, covering 42 villages (population: 107,440). A cross-sectional survey identified suspected pneumonia cases among 9,593 under-five children through house-to-house visits using a structured checklist. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, health insurance, care-seeking patterns, and provider preferences were collected. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) identified potential confounders in the association between care-seeking behaviour and key exposure variables. Additionally, qualitative in-depth interviews explored caregivers perceptions, decision-making, and healthcare barriers to pneumonia management. Quantitative data were analysed using logistic regression, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed using the Three Delays Model. Suspected under-five pneumonia cases caregivers and families were actively engaged in this formative phase to inform Phase II implementation strategies of broader IR, ensuring community-driven and contextually relevant strategies.

ResultsAmong 231 suspected pneumonia cases, 97% of caregivers sought medical care, but 71% consulted non-RMPs, and only 3.6% visited government facilities. Seeking appropriate care was associated with higher maternal education (AOR 6.5, 95% CI: 2.7, 9.7) and higher wealth index (AOR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.6). Thematic analysis revealed delays due to symptom misinterpretation, reliance on home remedies, financial constraints, gender biases, mistrust in public healthcare services, and logistical barriers.

ConclusionDespite high care-seeking rates, provider preferences, socio-cultural factors, and systemic barriers delay appropriate pneumonia treatment. Addressing these challenges requires improving awareness, enhancing public healthcare trust, and strengthening frontline health worker engagement. This study underscores the role of structured beneficiary involvement in refining pneumonia management strategies to ensure sustainable, community-driven interventions.

**Abstract:**
Psychedelics have garnered great attention in recent years as treatments for major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression due to their ability to alter consciousness and afflicted cognitive processes with lasting effects. Given these unique characteristics and the urgent need for efficacious treatments, psychedelics are being tested for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite promising results and growing interest, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics remain uncharacterized. Using a scoping review approach, we summarize current clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov that utilize classic psychedelics as interventions for SUDs with the goal of understanding the current state and outlook of the field. A second scoping review was conducted using PubMed and SCOPUS databases to identify the relevant publications addressing the pharmacotherapeutic potential of restoring dopamine homeostasis as a novel neurobiological mechanism of psychedelics. This mechanism may blunt drug-seeking behavior, promote drug abstinence, and underlie their clinical relevance for SUD in addition to previously characterized mechanisms.

**Abstract:**
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes significant morbidity, mortality, and growthth faltering among children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. While gut inflammation contributes to growth faltering, the role of ETEC in inflammation remains poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that ETEC-producing heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxins (ST) induced significant inflammation in humans, but LT-only strains are understudied. In this study, we evaluated the intestinal inflammation induced by the LT-only ETEC strain LSN03-016011/A in a human challenge model. Stool samples were analyzed for pre- and post-challenge myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines, ETEC shedding, and ETEC-specific antibody responses. MPO, IL-1{beta}, and IL-8 levels significantly increased post-ETEC challenge, but there was no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Participants protected from severe diarrhea had higher levels of pre-challenge IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-{gamma} compared to those not protected. The MPO and specific cytokine levels were significantly correlated with the seroconversion status to LT and the colonization factor antigen CS17. This study provides evidence that LT-ETEC strain can induce significant intestinal inflammation even in the absence of symptoms, highlighting the need for a vaccine and a better understanding of the impact of ETEC-attributable inflammation on child health in endemic areas.

Author summaryEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of enteric infections, resulting in diarrhea, malnutrition, and other long-term health effects. However, how ETEC - particularly strains that produce only the heat-labile toxin (LT) - can contribute to gut inflammation is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the impact of an LT-ETEC infection on gut inflammation and its relations to ETEC-specific immune responses using samples from participants in a controlled human infection study. We found that LT-ETEC induces a significant level of gut inflammation marker myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1{beta}, when the patients had moderate to severe diarrhea and even when diarrheal symptoms were mild or absent. Gut inflammation level correlated with immune responses to ETEC. These findings suggest that LT-ETEC infection causes significant gut inflammation, which plays a role in immune responses. Our results highlight the need for preventive strategies to reduce the burden of ETEC-related illness, particularly in regions where these infections are common, to prevent broader adverse consequences for gut health and child development.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundThe World Health Organization recommends perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), generally using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to children at high risk of severe P. falciparum malaria. Currently, PMC is given up to age two in perennial transmission settings. However, no recommendation exists for perennial settings with seasonal variation in transmission intensity, recently categorized as  sub-perennial. Tailored chemoprevention strategies are needed to protect children during seasons and ages of highest malaria risk. The seasonal dimension must adequately cover seasonally increased risk periods, alongside interventions that address year-round, lower intensity transmission. We propose a hybrid malaria chemoprevention (HMC) strategy, integrating two delivery components: 1) existing PMC, and 2) additional monthly SP doses during the higher-risk rainy season, ensuring a one-month gap between any two doses.

MethodsUsing a validated individual-based malaria model combined with pharmacological models of drug action (OpenMalaria), we examined the potential public health impact of the proposed HMC (for children 03-24 months), and an age-expanded HMC (referred to as HMC+, for children 03-36 months), under different drug sensitivity, coverage, and prevalence (5-70%) assumptions.

ResultsHMC and HMC+ demonstrated a median (interquartile range) of 2.1 (1.6-2.6), 2.9 (2.2-3.6) times higher efficacy (relative fold increase in burden averted) compared to only PMC against clinical, and 2.0 (0.6-3.4), 3.3 (0.8-5.8) against severe cases, respectively, in children under age three. This led to a median protective efficacy of 31.8% (25.4-38.2%), 44.9% (36.9-52.9%) against clinical, and 16.1% (7.0-25.2%), 26.4% (14.4-38.4%) against severe cases by HMC and HMC+ respectively, across the prevalence, drug sensitivity, and coverage assumptions. We found positive net impact for children under age five years, outweighing a limited potential of delayed malaria across settings.

ConclusionSubstantially increased public health benefits might be achieved by adding seasonally-targeted chemoprevention to current PMC in sub-perennial malaria transmission settings. Effectiveness-implementation studies should generate empirical evidence of public health impact including on the disease burden averted, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the hybrid approach. Such studies should also explore determinants of implementation success including operational feasibility, and acceptability of proposed dosing strategies which will facilitate deployment decisions.

**Abstract:**
Similarities between mental symptoms in Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and those in Post-COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PCVS) have been observed. Based on a representative survey of the population aged 18 to 69 years in Germany (n = 4,628), the epidemiologies of both PCS and PCVS were studied. Mental symptoms of PCS (fatigue/exhaustion/weakness, reduced performance, concentration and memory problems, sleep disorders and depressed mood) were reported by 12.1% and mental symptoms of PCVS were reported by 12.6% of all respondents. Concerning PCS, mental symptoms were reported more often by females compared to males (13.5% versus 10.7%), whereas no gender differences were found for PCVS. With the increasing number of booster vaccinations, mental PCVS decreased from 20.8% with one vaccination to 8.9% with four or more vaccinations. Overall, non-mRNA vaccines did not lead significantly to more mental symptoms than mRNA vaccines (12.9% versus 12.5%) but did differ concerning mental symptom patterns: concentration and memory problems (8.2% versus 3.3%), impaired performance (5.7% versus 4.2%) and sleep disorders (6.6% versus 3.2%) were reported more frequently in non-mRNA vaccines. The reported rate of mental PCVS being 12.6% is clearly higher than the 0.5% recorded by official documentation systems (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI)), suggesting a major underreporting. The data indicate that mental symptoms occurring in both PCS and PCVS are common, making the differential diagnosis between PCS and PCVS, as well as between both PCS and PCVS and independent mental disorders such as depressive disorders, an important but challenging task.

**Abstract:**
Background We aimed to estimate the burden of antibiotic-nonsusceptible non-bacteremic pneumonia and sinusitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in US adults ([&ge;]18 years). Methods We estimated antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococcal sinusitis and non-bacteremic pneumonia incidence as products of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates, serotype distribution, and serotype-specific antimicrobial nonsusceptibility prevalences by antibiotic class and guideline-recommended agents from 2016-2019. We derived pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates from national healthcare utilization surveys and administrative datasets; pneumococcal-attributable attributable percents and serotype distributions from published data; and serotype-specific nonsusceptibility estimates from Active Bacterial Core surveillance data. We evaluated nonsusceptibility for all serotypes and those targeted by 15-, 20- and 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15/20/21). Results An estimated 16.4% (95% confidence interval 12.8-21.4%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 19.0% (14.8-24.9%) of sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes, translating to 243,521 (179,673-333,675) and 1,844,726 (1,070,763-2,904,089) outpatient visits for pneumonia and sinusitis, respectively, and 10,155 (7,542-13,803) pneumonia hospitalizations annually. An estimated 31.2% (26.6-36.3%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 10.5% (9.4-12.0%) of pneumococcal sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]1 outpatient first-line antibiotic agent. Cases attributable to serotypes targeted by PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21 that were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes accounted for 7.4% (4.7-11.1%), 8.5% (5.8-12.1%), and 12.6% (9.2-17.5%) of all non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia cases, and 8.4% (5.3-12.5%), 9.4% (6.2-13.4), and 14.4% (10.4-20.0%) of all pneumococcal sinusitis cases. Conclusions We demonstrated high proportions of antibiotic nonsusceptibility in non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis in US adults. PCVs and antibiotic stewardship may mitigate antibiotic nonsusceptibility in pneumococcal disease.

**Abstract:**
Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a promising non-invasive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), though significant variability exists in patient responses. This quadruple-blind, sham-controlled crossover randomized clinical trial investigated whether clinical improvement was influenced by the spatial selection of stimulation sites or early cardiac rhythm modulations. Seventy-five MDD patients (33 women) were randomized to either personalized stimulation sites, identified via the strongest negative functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the default mode network (DMN), or fixed stimulation at the F3 position of the 10-20 EEG system. Electrocardiograms throughout stimulation monitored heart rate and its variability, focusing on heartbeat deceleration (RR slope) and changes in the root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats (RMSSD). Findings demonstrated that a higher RR slope within the first 45 seconds of stimulation predicted greater clinical improvement at six weeks, while a lower RMSSD change during the first 270 seconds correlated with improvement at one week. However, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between personalized and fixed stimulation sites. This study identified a significant relationship between early heart rhythm modulations and the antidepressant effects of accelerated iTBS in MDD. Although the spatial determination of stimulation sites did not enhance clinical improvement, iTBS-induced changes in cardiac rhythm during early sessions may develop into valuable biomarkers for stratifying patients, enabling more personalized and effective treatment strategies in the future.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: University students frequently experience challenges that affect their sleep quality, including academic stress, lifestyle habits, and socio-demographic factors. Common sleep disturbances, such as delayed sleep onset and poor sleep efficiency, often result in daytime dysfunction and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm. Methods: This cross-sectional study appraised sleep quality among undergraduate students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 530 undergraduate students were purposively selected from three public universities. Participants were chosen through convenience sampling, with students who had contracted COVID-19 during the study excluded from the sample. Results: The mean age of the university students was 21.1 (2.0) years. Regarding PSQI components, the participants showed moderate sleep latency (55.7%) and habitual sleep efficiency (56.0%), with mild levels of sleep disturbances at night (68.1%), daytime dysfunction (51.1%), and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm (48.5%). The global PSQI scores were poor for 59.4% of participants, while 40.6% had good scores, with a mean of 6.5(2.9). Among the students, 44.9% reported fair subjective sleep quality, followed by good (24.7%), very good (18.1%), and poor (12.3%) sleep quality. Lifestyle factors such as class attendance, online media usage, BMI, physical exercise, tea/coffee consumption, and smoking were significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Sleep quality factors like daytime sleep duration, nighttime sleep latency, and sleeping pill usage were also significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Significant associations were found between sleep quality and factors such as age, household income, daily study hours, BMI, daytime sleep, and sleep latency (p<0.05). Conclusion: The study revealed that longer sleep latency, daytime sleep, and sleeping pill usage were related with poorer sleep quality. It also emphasized that sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm were significant predictors of sleep quality.

**Abstract:**
In 2024, the Americas region experienced the largest dengue outbreak on record and Brazil was among the worst affected countries, reporting 6.6 million cases and 6,200 deaths. We report the long-term entomological and epidemiological effectiveness of city-wide deployment of wMel-strain Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti in Niteroi, a city of half a million people in Rio de Janeiro state, where Wolbachia releases across 70% of the urban population in 2017-2019 were expanded to remaining populated areas in 2023. wMel was durably established at [&ge;]95% prevalence in Ae. aegypti populations throughout Niteroi four years post-release, and up to seven years in the earliest release sites. This city-wide Wolbachia coverage provided sustained population-level protection against dengue throughout the five years post-intervention, including during the 2024 epidemic surge, averting an estimated three-quarters of the dengue case burden that would otherwise have been expected in Niteroi in 2024.

**Abstract:**
Background: Patients with rare cancers face substantial challenges due to limited evidence-based treatment options, resulting from sparse clinical trials. Advances in large language models (LLMs) and recommendation algorithms offer new opportunities to utilize all clinical trial information to improve clinical decisions. Methods: We used LLM to systematically extract and standardize more than 100,000 cancer trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Each trial was annotated using a customized scoring system reflecting cancer-treatment interactions based on clinical outcomes and trial attributes. Using this structured data set, we implemented three state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend potentially effective treatments across different cancer types. Results: The LLM-driven data extraction process successfully generated a comprehensive and rigorously curated database from fragmented clinical trial information, covering 78 cancer types and 5,315 distinct interventions. Recommendation models demonstrated high predictive accuracy (cross-validated RMSE: {0.49--0.62}) and identified clinically meaningful new treatments for melanoma, independently validated by oncology experts. Conclusions: Our study establishes a proof of concept demonstrating that the combination of LLMs with sophisticated recommendation algorithms can systematically identify novel and clinically plausible cancer treatments. This integrated approach may accelerate the identification of effective therapies for rare cancers, ultimately improving patient outcomes by generating evidence-based treatment recommendations where traditional data sources remain limited.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: Though dementia is a serious illness that progresses over many years, little is known about the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Objective: To test the impact of a virtual, nurse-led primary palliative care intervention on older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Methods: This randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed to compare the impact of {usual care} to {usual care plus a virtual, nurse-led, primary palliative care intervention} on community- dwelling, chronically ill older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Results: We hypothesize that patients in the virtual nurse intervention arm will have their primary palliative care needs identified and fulfilled compared to those in the usual care arm. Conclusions: Identification of the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of and/or with MCI, mild or moderate dementia will help refine intervention to effectively provide primary palliative care in a timely manner to these patients.

**Abstract:**
Introduction. HIV testing and treatment coverage among men in Zambia remains suboptimal, partly due to lower healthcare-seeking behavior compared to women. To address this gap, Circle of Hope (CoH), a local faith-based organization funded by the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), developed the community post (CP) model. CPs are staffed by multi-disciplinary teams that provide HIV-testing, anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) testing. This analysis assesses the impact of these CPs on HIV case finding, ART initiation, and VL suppression among men. Methods. Routine program data reported to PEPFAR by CoH Zambia were analyzed for two periods: pre-COVID 19 (April 2018-March 2020) and during the pandemic (April 2020-March 2022). Indicators included the number of HIV tests conducted and positive results received (overall and for index testing specifically), ART initiation among men living with HIV (MLHIV), 12-month retention on ART, and the proportion of clients with VL suppression (<1000 copies/mL). Results. Between April 2018 and March 2022, the number of CPs expanded from 9 to 38 across Zambia. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, men continued to represent a substantial share of clients: 49.5% to 41.4% of those tested, 38.5% to 42.0% of those diagnosed (p<0.001), and 38.9% to 43.3% of those initiated on ART (p<0.001). The number of men on ART rose from 3,320 (38%) to 13,580 (43%, p<0.000001). Retention and VL suppression among men also remained high, increasing slightly from 94% to 97% and 95% to 96%, respectively. Over 6,000 men were diagnosed through index testing services, with percent positivity consistently high, ranging from 54.4% to 61.1% (p<0.001). Conclusions. The CoH model was successful at identifying and linking MLHIV to HIV treatment services and assisting them to achieve and maintain viral suppression even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding this community-based model may help close HIV testing and treatment gaps among men and advance HIV epidemic control in Zambia and beyond.

**Abstract:**
Background There is a need for person-centred outcome measures (PCOMs) in tuberculosis (TB) clinical trials to capture the priorities of affected individuals relating to both disease and treatment, alongside the traditional efficacy and safety analysis. Methods We conducted a literature search to identify existing health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) measurement tools and instances where they have been used to evaluate TB disease in interventional studies. DR-TB survivors were recruited for focus group discussions in South Africa, Mongolia and Georgia to determine the most important aspects of disease and treatment experience from their perspective. A second round of focus groups then worked to prioritise these items and group them within different domains. A panel of researchers and academic clinicians evaluated existing PCOMs identified in the literature search using a published framework. Finally, an assessment was carried out by a experienced TB Community Advisory Group members for appropriateness and acceptability, and clinical trial site investigators for feasibility of the PCOMs. Results The initial round of 9 focus groups involving 57 participants identified priority items grouped under the fields overall quality of life, disease symptoms, and treatment and side effects. In the second round of four focus groups involving 26 participants, the highest ranked items under overall quality of life were duration of treatment, experience of swallowing pills, and how long before being able to contribute to the household. The most important symptoms were coughing, weight loss and breathlessness. The highest ranked side effects were nausea/vomiting, skin colour changes, and nerve problems. FACIT-TB was the only measurement tool assessed that was rated good for appropriateness, and excellent, good or fair in all other fields by community representatives, researchers and clinical trial site staff. Conclusions The FACIT-TB measurement tool was identified as the most appropriate disease-specific PCOM currently available for use in clinical trials investigating novel DR-TB therapeutics.

**Abstract:**
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) 2024 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment guidelines expand eligibility for nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment in individuals with chronic HBV infection. For countries to implement these guidelines, there is a critical need to understand the population who are treatment eligible. While HBV drug resistance (HBVDR) is uncommon, monitoring for any potential resistance is a relevant public health consideration. Methods: We studied a population in rural Uganda to describe the proportion of individuals eligible for treatment based on the 2024 WHO treatment guidelines. We determined how this proportion varies according to the eligibility criteria used, comparing the performance of different assessment tools. We calculated Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet Ratio Index; APRI, Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase-to-Platelet Ratio; GPR and transient elastography; TE and performed HBV sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology to determine the prevalence of HBVDR in treatment naive and treatment experienced individuals. Results: In this cohort, 24/63 (38%) individuals with CHB were eligible for treatment. This fell to 14/63 (22%) in a hypothetical scenario where TE was not available for the assessment of liver fibrosis. We demonstrate a lack of concordance between non-invasive tests (NIT) of liver disease in treatment-naive HBV mono-infected individuals. An APRI cut-off of 0.5 had a sensitivity of 23.0% for predicting a TE score of >7 kPa (F2 fibrosis). Sensitivity for detecting F2 fibrosis was increased to 38.5% using an APRI cut off of 0.36, and to 46.2% using the GPR. We did not identify any HBVDR in the HBV mono-infected treatment-naive population (n=58). 24/210 individuals were living with HIV/HBV coinfection; HBV was sequenced in 5 of these of whom 2 had genomic evidence of nucleos(t)ide analogue resistance (rt180M/204V). Conclusions: While the WHO 2024 treatment criteria offer an opportunity to expand access to care, there is a need to determine how assessment tools differ in determination of eligibility in different settings. HBVDR remains uncommon but more research is needed to understand its prevalence and clinical impact in African populations.

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

## Crosstalk between Proline Hydroxylation and Histidine Methylation Regulates Actin-Dependent Cell Mobility Control

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Abstract:**
Background: The growing availability of large genomic datasets presents an opportunity to discover new metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions useful for industrial or synthetic biological applications. Efforts to identify new enzyme functions in this huge number of sequences cannot be achieved without the help of bioinformatics tools and the development of new strategies. Standard methods for assigning a biological function to a gene are based on sequence similarity. However, another way is to mine databases to identify conserved gene clusters (i.e. syntenies). Indeed in prokaryotic genomes, genes involved in the same pathway are frequently encoded in a single locus with an operonic organisation. This Genomic Context (GC) conservation is considered as a reliable indicator of functional relationships, and thus is a promising approach to improve the gene function prediction. Methods. Here we present NetSyn (Network Synteny), a tool which aims to cluster protein sequences according to the similarity of their genomic context rather than their sequence similarity. Starting from a set of protein sequences of interest, NetSyn retrieves neighbouring genes from the corresponding genomes as well as their protein sequences. Homologous protein families are then computed to measure GC conservation between each pair of input sequences using a GC conservation score. A network is created where nodes represent the input proteins and edges the fact that two proteins share a common GC. The weight of the edges corresponds to the synteny conservation score. The network is then partitioned into clusters of proteins sharing a high degree of synteny conservation. Results. As a proof of concept, we used NetSyn on two different datasets. The first one is made of homologous sequences of an enzyme family (the BKACE family, previously named DUF849) to divide it into sub-families of specific activities. NetSyn was able to go a step further by providing additional subfamilies to those already published. The second dataset corresponds to a set of non-homologous proteins consisting of different Glycosyl Hydrolases (GH) with the aim of interconnecting them and finding conserved operon-like genomic structures. NetSyn was able to find a locus composed of 3 non homologous glycosyl hydrolases, involved in the degradation of xyloglucan, in 162 genomes. Discussion. NetSyn is able to cluster proteins according to their genomic context, making it possible to establish functional links between proteins without considering their sequence similarity alone. We showed that NetSyn is efficient in exploring large protein families to define iso-functional groups. It can also highlight functional interactions between proteins from different families and predicts new conserved genomic structures that have not yet been experimentally characterised. NetSyn can also be useful for pinpointing annotation errors that have been propagated across databases, and for suggesting annotations on proteins currently annotated as "unknown".

**Abstract:**
The locus coeruleus (LC), the major source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is among the earliest site of pathology in both Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD), and it undergoes catastrophic degeneration later in both disorders. Dysregulation of the LC is thought to contribute to prodromal symptoms of AD and PD such as anxiety and sleep disturbances, while frank LC loss promotes cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms responsible for its selective vulnerability are unknown. It has been suggested that neuromelanin (NM) pigment contributes to LC susceptibility, but causal relationships have been difficult to test because rodents do not naturally produce NM. Here, we report that viral-mediated expression of human tyrosinase induced pigmentation in mouse LC neurons that recapitulated key features of natural primate NM. One week of NM accumulation resulted in LC neuron hyperactivity, reduced tissue NE levels, transcriptional changes, and anxiety-like behavior. By 6-10 weeks, NM accumulation was associated with severe LC neuron neurodegeneration and microglial engulfment of the pigment granules, while the anxiety-like behavior abated. These phenotypes are reminiscent of LC dysfunction and cell death in AD and PD, validating this model for studying the consequences of NM accumulation in the LC as it relates to neurodegenerative disease.

Significance StatementAlzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) are two of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Because therapies that cure or even prevent their progression are lacking, research is focused on the identifying earliest signs of disease as targets for diagnosis and treatment. The locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of the neurotransmitter n norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is one of the first brain regions affected in both AD and PD. LC dysregulation promotes prodromal AD and PD symptoms, while its degeneration accelerates disease progression. Here we identify neuromelanin (NM) pigment as a LC vulnerability factor that induces neuronal hyperactivity followed by cell death. Approaches that mitigate NM accumulation and toxicity may target the earliest phases of neurodegenerative disease.

**Abstract:**
Brain pericytes maintain the blood-brain barrier (BBB), secrete neurotrophic factors and clear toxic proteins. Their loss in neurological disorders leads to BBB breakdown, neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Therefore, cell therapy to replace lost pericytes holds potential to restore impaired cerebrovascular and brain functions. However, the molecular composition and function of human iPSC-derived brain pericytes (iPSC-PC) remains poorly characterized. Here, we show by a quantitative analysis of 8,344 proteins and 20,572 phosphopeptides that iPSC-PC share 96% of total proteins and 98% of protein phosphorylation sites with primary human brain pericytes. This includes cell adhesion and tight junction proteins, transcription factors, and different protein kinase families of the human kinome. In pericyte-deficient mice, iPSC-PC home to host brain capillaries to form hybrid human-mouse microvessels with ligand-receptor associations. They repair BBB leaks and protect against neuron loss, which we show requires PDGRFB and pleiotrophin. They also clear Alzheimer's amyloid-beta; and tau neurotoxins via lipoprotein receptor. Thus, iPSC-PC may have potential as a replacement therapy for pericyte-deficient neurological disorders.

**Abstract:**
Disease phenotypes can be described as the consequence of interactions among molecular processes that are altered beyond resilience. Here, we address the challenge of assessing the possible alteration of intra- and inter-cellular molecular interactions among gene sets, which are intended to represent processes and or cellular phenotypes. We present an approach, designated as "Ulisse", which complements the existing methods of enrichment analysis and cell-cell communication analysis. It can be applied to a gene list as well as multiple ranked gene lists, typically derived in the context of omics or multi-omics studies. The approach highlights the presence of alterations in those components that control the interactions between processes or cells. Crosstalk quantification is supported by two null models. Further, the approach provides an additional way of identifying the genes associated with the phenotype. As a proof-of-concept, we applied Ulisse to study the alteration of pathway crosstalks and cell-cell communications in triple negative breast cancer samples, based on single-cell RNA sequencing. In conclusion, our work supports the usefulness of crosstalk analysis as an additional instrument in the "toolkit" of biomedical research for translating complex biological data into actionable insights.

**Abstract:**
In the human brain, the alpha rhythm in occipital cortex and the mu rhythm in sensorimotor cortex are among the most prominent rhythms, with both rhythms functionally implicated in gating modality-specific information. Separation of these rhythms is non-trivial due to the spatial mixing of these oscillations in sensor space. Using a computationally efficient processing pipeline requiring no manual data cleaning, we isolated alpha and/or mu rhythms from electroencephalography recordings performed on 1605 children aged 5-18. Using the extracted time series for each rhythm, we characterized the waveform shape on a cycle-by-cycle basis and examined whether and how the waveform shape differs across development. We demonstrate that alpha and mu rhythms both exhibit nonsinusoidal waveform shape that changes significantly across development, in addition to the known large changes in oscillatory frequency. This dataset also provided an opportunity to assess oscillatory measures for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found no differences in the resting-state features of these alpha-band rhythms for either ADHD or ASD in comparison to typically developing participants in this dataset. While waveform shape is ignored by traditional Fourier spectral analyses, these nonsinusoidal properties may be informative for building more constrained generative models for different types of alpha-band rhythms, yielding more specific insight into their generation.

**Abstract:**
Perceptual decision-making is the process by which an animal uses sensory stimuli to choose an action or mental proposition. This process is thought to be mediated by neurons organized as attractor networks1,2. However, whether attractor dynamics underlie decision behavior and the complex neuronal responses remains unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings from hundreds of neurons, together with an unsupervised, deep learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in frontal cortex and striatum of rats while the subjects accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes, the first dominated by sensory inputs, and the second dominated by the autonomous dynamics, with flow in a direction (i.e., "neural mode") largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that the transition to the second regime corresponds to the moment of decision commitment. We developed a simplified model that approximates the coupled transition in dynamics and neural mode and allows precise inference, from each trials large-scale neural population activity, of a putative neurally-inferred time of commitment ("nTc") on that trial. The simplified model captures diverse and complex single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping3-5, as well as trial-averaged curved trajectories6-8, and reveals distinctions between brain regions. The estimated nTc times were not time-locked to stimulus onset or offset, or to response onset, but were instead broadly distributed across trials. If nTc marks the moment of decision commitment, sensory evidence before nTc should affect the decision, while evidence afterward should not. Behavioral analysis of trials aligned to their estimated nTc times confirmed this prediction. Our results show that the formation of a perceptual choice involves a rapid, coordinated transition in both the dynamical regime and the neural mode of the decision process that corresponds to commitment to a decision, and suggest this moment as a useful entry point for dissecting mechanisms underlying rapid changes in internal state.

**Abstract:**
Microbes exhibit precise control over their composition and geometry in order to adapt and grow in diverse environments. However, the mechanisms that orchestrate this simultaneous regulation, and how they are causally linked, remains poorly understood. In this work, we derive and experimentally test a biophysical model of cell size regulation in Escherichia coli which relates the cellular surface-to-volume ratio to the total macromolecular composition and partitioning of the proteome between cellular compartments. Central to this model is the observation that the macromolecular density of the cytoplasm and the protein density within the cell membranes are maintained at a constant ratio across growth conditions. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, single-cell microscopy, and biochemical assays, we show this model quantitatively predicts a non-linear relationship between the surface-to-volume ratio, proteome localization, and the total ribosome content of the cell. This model holds under perturbations of intracellular ppGpp concentrations-thereby changing the ribosomal content-demonstrating that cellular geometry is not strictly determined by the cellular growth rate. These findings provide a biophysical link between the coregulation of proteome organization and cellular geometry, offering a quantitative framework for understanding bacterial size regulation across conditions.

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a mathematical model for the growth of transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) inclusion bodies in neuron soma. The parameter representing accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers is also introduced. The models equations allow for the numerical calculation of the concentrations of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, as well as free TDP-43 oligomers and those deposited into inclusion bodies. By simulating the deposition of free oligomers into inclusion bodies, the model predicts the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies. An approximate solution to the model equations is derived for the scenario where protein degradation machinery is dysfunctional, leading to infinite half-lives for TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and both free and deposited oligomers. This solution, valid for large times, predicts that the inclusion body radius increases proportionately to the cube root of time, while accumulated neurotoxicity increases linearly with time. To the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to model the relationship between the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies and time, as well as the first to introduce the concept of accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers. The sensitivity analysis of the approximate solution indicates that the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity are independent of the kinetic constants at large timescales. While the numerical solution of the full mathematical model continues to work with finite half-lives, the approximate solution becomes invalid for scenarios with physiologically relevant (finite) half-lives of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and free misfolded oligomers. In contrast to the scenario with infinite half-lives, the numerical solution reveals that for different values of the kinetic constants, the curves representing the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity converge to distinct curves as time progresses.

**Abstract:**
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is typically treated empirically with vancomycin, with therapy later tailored based on susceptibility results. However, these tests occur before vancomycin exposure and do not account for adaptation during empiric treatment that can alter S. aureus susceptibility to first-line drugs. To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU, impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes. Our findings suggest a probabilistic approach to antimicrobial therapy, advocating for rapid genomic diagnostics alongside susceptibility testing to better anticipate and respond to evolutionary changes.

SignificanceAntibiotic treatment can influence bacterial evolution, altering the effectiveness of subsequent therapies by inducing collateral resistance or sensitivity. This study reveals that evolution toward vancomycin-intermediate resistance in the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus proceeds through at least two distinct evolutionary pathways: one characterized by alterations in cell wall metabolism and another by changes in global stress response. These adaptive trajectories result in contrasting collateral sensitivities to first-line antibiotics. By introducing the Collateral Response Score, we assess the uncertainty in these outcomes, providing a probabilistic framework to evaluate how past antibiotic exposure shapes future treatment responses. Further validation studies are needed; however, we believe that improved forecasting of pathogen evolution can enhance antibiotic stewardship, inform therapeutic decisions, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

**Abstract:**
Recent studies have established a reciprocal causal link between aging and the activation of transposable elements, characterized in particular by a de-repression of LINE-1 retrotransposons. These LINE-1 elements represent 21% of the human genome, but only a minority of these sequences retain the coding potential essential for their mobility. LINE-1 encoded proteins can induce cell toxicity implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, our knowledge of the expression and localization of LINE-1-encoded proteins in the central nervous system is limited. Using a novel approach combining atlas-based brain mapping with deep-learning algorithms on large-scale pyramidal brain images, we unveil a heterogeneous, neuron-predominant and widespread ORF1p expression throughout the murine brain at steady-state. In aged mice, ORF1p expression increases significantly which is corroborated in human post-mortem dopaminergic neurons by an increase in young LINE-1 elements including those with open reading frames. Mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous mouse ORF1p revealed novel, neuron-specific protein interactors. These findings contribute to a comprehensive description of the dynamics of LINE-1 and ORF1p expression in the brain at steady-state and in aging and provide insights on ORF1p protein interactions in the brain.

**Abstract:**
Proteobacterial methanotrophs are dependent on the oxidation of methane for ATP production and assimilation of carbon into biomass. Interestingly, some types of gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs thrive in oxygen-depleted zones of lakes and other aquatic ecosystems despite their reliance on oxygen to support methane oxidation. The model gammaproteobacterial methanotroph, Methylomonas denitrificans FJG1, oxidizes methane coupled to nitrate reduction under hypoxia and highly upregulates its expression of bacteriohemerythrin (Bhr). Bhr is a homolog of eukaryotic hemerythrin, which is a protein associated with oxygen binding. Ten bhr homologs were identified in the genome of M. denitrificans FJG1, requiring phylogenetic and gene expression analyses to pinpoint which homolog is likely responsible for delivering oxygen to support methane oxidation to under low oxygen conditions. This study examined the prevalence and phylogeny of the 10 bhr homologs from M. denitrificans FJG1 in the genomes of other methanotrophs and across the Bacteria. The homolog denoted "bhr-00" was specific to methanotroph genomes, was highly expressed in M. denitrificans FJG1 under hypoxia, and its predicted structure was nearly identical to a purified oxygen-scavenging hemerythrin protein from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath. Other bhr homologs upregulated from denitrifying cultures of M. denitrificans FJG1 included those with gene neighborhoods related to oxygen sensing, denitrification and chemotaxis. Together, this study uncovered potential multifunctional roles of bacteriohemerythrin genes of M. denitrificans FJG1 under low oxygen conditions and identified the bhr homolog that most likely enables and supports oxygen delivery to methane monooxygenase enzymes in anoxic ecosystems.

**Abstract:**
Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker[-&gt;]Brainstem[-&gt;]Thalamus[-&gt;]Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking activity upon multi-whisker stimulation, resembling the stable response pattern observed in barrels. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions.

**Abstract:**
The Global Pandemic Lineage (GPL) of the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been described as a main driver of amphibian extinctions on nearly every continent. Near complete genome of three Bd-GPL strains have enabled studies of the pathogen but the genomic features that set Bd-GPL apart from other Bd lineages is not well understood due to a lack of high-quality genome assemblies and annotations from other lineages. We used long-read DNA sequencing to assemble high-quality genomes of three Bd-BRAZIL isolates and one non-pathogen outgroup species Polyrhizophydium stewartii (Ps) strain JEL0888, and compared these to genomes of previously sequenced Bd-GPL strains. The Bd-BRAZIL assemblies range in size between 22.0 and 26.1 Mb and encode 8495-8620 protein-coding genes for each strain. Our pan-genome analysis provided insight into shared and lineage-specific gene content. The core genome of Bd consists of 6278 conserved gene families, with 202 Bd-BRAZIL and 172 Bd-GPL specific gene families. We discovered gene copy number variation in pathogenicity gene families between Bd-BRAZIL and Bd-GPL strains though none were consistently expanded in Bd-GPL or Bd-BRAZIL strains. Comparison within the Batrachochytrium genus and two closely related non-pathogenic saprophytic chytrids identified variation in sequence and protein domain counts. We further test these new Bd-BRAZIL genomes to assess their utility as reference genomes for transcriptome alignment and analysis. Our analysis examines the genomic variation between strains in Bd-BRAZIL and Bd-GPL and offers insights into the application of these genomes as reference genomes for future studies.

**Abstract:**
Deep learning-based compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction models are promising in the field of molecular biology, particularly for facilitating the drug discovery process. In practical applications, CPI models should achieve a high generalization performance, quantify prediction confidence, and ensure explainability. Here, we propose ChemGLaM, a chemical genomics language model for reliable and explainable CPI predictions, by addressing these three crucial aspects. ChemGLaM integrates independently pre-trained chemical and protein language models through an interaction block with a cross-attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in predicting novel CPIs. Incorporating uncertainty estimation and attention visualization enables ChemGLaM to enhance the success rate of virtual screening and to provide molecular insights into CPIs. Furthermore, we demonstrate its practical applicability by constructing a public database for large-scale CPI predictions and enabling drug/target exploration for candidate treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ChemGLaM represents a significant step toward overcoming the challenges of AI-driven drug discovery and addressing unmet medical needs.

**Abstract:**
In rodents, estrogens aromatized from androgens in the brain are essential for the development of male-typical behaviors. In many other vertebrates including humans and teleost fish, however, androgens facilitate these behaviors directly via the androgen receptor without aromatization into estrogens. Here we report that mutagenesis-derived male medaka fish lacking Cyp19a1b (a subtype of aromatase predominantly expressed in the brain) exhibit severely impaired male-typical mating and aggression, despite elevated brain androgen levels. These phenotypes can be rescued by estrogen administration, indicating that brain-derived estrogens are pivotal for male-typical behaviors even in teleosts. Our results further suggest that these estrogens facilitate male-typical behaviors by potentiating androgen action in the brain via the direct stimulation of androgen receptor transcription, thereby revealing a previously unappreciated mode of action of brain-derived estrogens. We additionally show that female fish lacking Cyp19a1b are less receptive to male courtship and conversely court other females, highlighting the significance of brain-derived estrogens in establishing sex-typical behaviors in both sexes.

## Striated fibre assemblins localise in the feeding groove of the 'typical excavate' Paratrimastix pyriformis

**Abstract:**
The spatial arrangement of microtubules in the cytoskeleton in the cells of protists has been used for decades for taxonomy and phylogenetic inference at various levels. In contrast, the protein composition of non-microtubular structures is mostly unknown. Exceptions are system I fibers in algae, which are built of striated fiber assemblins (SFAs). Interestingly, SFAs are also components of a range of other, dissimilar structures, playing a role in the cortex of ciliates, cell division in apicomplexans, and adhesion of the parasite Giardia to the intestine. In a broad bioinformatic survey, we show the existence of three ancestral eukaryotic paralogues of SFA, and note that they are present in all "typical excavates:" small heterotrophic flagellates bearing a ventral feeding groove. In one representative, Paratrimastix pyriformis, we detected two SFA paralogs using specific antibodies and expansion microscopy. We show that they co-localize selectively with several microtubules and structures attached to the basal body of the posterior flagellum, namely the right microtubular root, B-fiber, C-fiber, and composite fiber. We demonstrate that one of the paralogs self-assembles in vitro into striated filaments which, under negative staining and cryo-electron microscopy, resemble system I fibers as seen in previous studies. Given the facts that all three SFA paralogs appear to be ancestral to most eukaryotic lineages, as is probably the morphology of "typical excavates" with a ventral groove, we speculate that a role in the development or function of the feeding apparatus of the common ancestor of most if not all eukaryotes was the primary function of these proteins.

**Abstract:**
Understanding how the eyes, head, and hands coordinate in natural contexts is a critical challenge in visuomotor coordination research, often constrained by sedentary tasks, cued actions, or restricted settings. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment where participants could self-generate pick-and-place actions on a life-size shelf in a virtual environment, recording concurrent gaze and body movements. Subjects exhibited intricate translation and rotation movements of the eyes, head, and hands during the task. We employed a time-dependent principal component analysis to study the relationship between the movements of the eyes, head, and hands relative to the onset of the action. We reduced the overall dimensionality into 2D representations, capturing up to 65% of the movement variance just in time with the actions. Our analysis revealed a synergistic coupling of the eye-head and eye-hand systems, as well as a strong coupling within the head-hand system. The eyes synchronized with the head and hands close to the action onset, with variations in coupling observed in horizontal and vertical planes, indicating distinct mechanisms for coordination in the brain. Crucially, the head and hands remained tightly coupled throughout the observation period, suggesting a shared neural code driving these effectors. Notably, the low-dimensional representations of the eye-head-hand movement vectors showed maximum predictive accuracy of the actions location ~200ms before the action onset, highlighting just-in-time coordination among the three effectors. Furthermore, the predictive accuracy was significantly influenced by the location of the upcoming action. Our study emphasizes the differential visuomotor control subject to the task structure, providing insights into the dynamic interplay of eye, head, and hand movements during natural behavior.

NEW & NOTEWORTHYStudying natural, self-initiated, complex visuomotor coordination, we observe low-dimensional dynamics with distinct patterns along horizontal and vertical axes. The eyes horizontal movement showed notable independence, aligning with head and hand movements just in time for action. Notably, around critical events, the dimensionality of the complex movements is further reduced, indicating dynamic correspondence of eye-head-hand coordination.

**Abstract:**
Stimulation of specific cell groups under different network regimes (e.g., spontaneous activity or sensory-evoked activity) can provide insights into the neural dynamics of cortical columns. While these protocols are challenging to perform experimentally, modelling can serve as a powerful tool for such explorations. Using detailed electrophysiological and anatomical data from mouse V1, we built a novel spiking network model of a cortical column, which incorporates pyramidal cells and three distinct interneuron types (PV, SST, and VIP cells, specified per lamina), as well as the dynamic and voltage-dependent properties of AMPA, GABA, and NMDA receptors. We first demonstrate that thalamocortical feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) stimuli arriving in the column have opposite effects, leading to net columnar excitation and inhibition respectively and revealing translaminar gain control via full-column inhibition by layer 6. We then perturb one cell group (i.e. a cell type in a specific layer) at a time and observe the effects on other cell groups under distinct network states: spontaneous, feedforward-driven, feedback-driven, and a combination of feedforward and feedback. Our findings reveal that when a given group is perturbed, the columnar response varies significantly based on its state, with strong sensory feedforward input decreasing columnar sensitivity to all perturbations and feedback input serving as modulator of intra columnar interactions. Given that activity changes within specific neuronal populations are difficult to predict a priori in experiments, our model may constitute a useful tool to predict outcomes of perturbations and assist in experimental design.

Author SummaryIn this study, we explored how stimulating specific groups of neurons under different conditions (spontaneous or stimulus-evoked states) can help us understand the dynamics of visual cortical columns in mouse cortex. We developed a data-constrained model of a cortical column that includes several cell types (excitatory neurons as well as multiple inhibitory neuron types) and synaptic receptors. Our findings reveal that signals coming from higher brain areas (feedback input) and sensory input (feedforward input) have different impacts on the column: sensory inputs generally increase activity within the column, while feedback tends to decrease it. We then considered input targeting one cell type at a time to see how it affects the internal dynamics. Our results show that neural responses to selected input vary depending on whether the cortical column is in a resting state or being stimulated by feedforward input or feedback input. This model is a useful tool for predicting the outcomes of these cell interactions, which can help in planning real-world experiments and understanding how our brain processes information.

**Abstract:**
Synapses formed by equivalent pairs of pre- and postsynaptic neurons have similar electrophysiological characteristics, belonging to the same type. However, these are generally confined to microscopic brain regions, precluding their proteomic analysis. This fact has greatly limited our ability to investigate the molecular basis of synaptic physiology. We introduce a procedure to characterise the synaptic proteome of microscopic brain regions and explore the molecular diversity among the synapses forming the trisynaptic circuit in the hippocampus. While we observe a remarkable proteomic diversity among these synapses, we also report that proteins involved in the regulation of the function of glutamate receptors are differentially expressed in all of them. Moreover, neuron-specific gene expression programs would contribute to their regulation. Here, we introduce a combined proteomics and transcriptomics analysis uncovering a previously unrecognised neuron-specific control of synaptic proteome diversity, directed towards the regulation of glutamate receptors and their regulatory proteins.

**Abstract:**
Single-cell multiomic techniques have sparked immense interest in developing a comprehensive multi-modal map of diverse neuronal cell types and their brain wide projections. However, investigating the spatial organization, transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of brain wide projection neurons is hampered by the lack of efficient and easily adoptable tools. Here we introduce Projection-TAGs, a retrograde AAV platform that allows multiplex tagging of projection neurons using RNA barcodes. By using Projection-TAGs, we performed multiplex projection tracing of the mouse cortex and high-throughput single-cell profiling of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of the cortical projection neurons. Projection-TAGs can be leveraged to obtain a snapshot of activity-dependent recruitment of distinct projection neurons and their molecular features in the context of a specific stimulus. Given its flexibility, usability, and compatibility, we envision that Projection-TAGs can be readily applied to build a comprehensive multi-modal map of brain neuronal cell types and their projections.

## Mimicking opioid analgesia in cortical pain circuits

**Abstract:**
The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural dynamics to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviors and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep-learning behavioral analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an unpleasant, affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective-motivational behaviors without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic mu-opioid receptor promoter to drive chemogenetic inhibition. This opioid-mimetic gene therapy recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain, thereby offering a new strategy for precision pain management targeting a key nociceptive cortical opioid circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

**Abstract:**
The events that lead to protein misfolding diseases are not fully understood. Many proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., TDP43) interact with nucleic acids, including RNA G-quadruplexes. In this work, we investigate whether RNA G-quadruplexes play a role in TDP43 condensation in biophysical and cellular models. We find that G-quadruplexes modulate TDP43 aggregation in vitro and condensation in multiple cell types, including yeast, HEK293T, and motor-neuron-like NSC-34 cells. In yeast cells, treatment with G-quadruplexes causes increased TDP43 accumulation in cells before cellular death. In HEK293T cells expressing TDP43, incubation with G-quadruplex-binding small molecules causes an increase in G4 stability that also stabilizes TDP43 and reduces TDP43 condensation induced by proteasomal or oxidative stress. Finally, in NSC-34 cells overexpressing exogenous TDP43, we show that G-quadruplexes co-localize with TDP43 condensates under stress conditions and treatment with G-quadruplex-binding small molecules decreases TDP43-mediated toxicity. Together, these findings suggest that a novel future approach to explore for treating protein misfolding diseases may be to target specific RNA structures such as G-quadruplexes.

**Abstract:**
Archaeal tubulin-like cytoskeletal protein CetZ1 is required for rod-cell morphogenesis during the development of motile cells in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. It has been unknown whether CetZ1 or its paralogs contribute to motility solely through the effects of rod cell shape on swimming speed, or in other ways too. Here, we found that CetZ1 also plays significant roles in the polar assembly of the motility machinery including the archaellum base protein ArlD1, the chemotaxis sensory array adapter CheW1, and signal transducer CheY. Notably, overexpression of cetZ1 or cetZ2 differentially influenced motility and the polar assembly of the motility machinery, but caused no detectable change in the rod shape of motile cells. CetZ1 localized at the poles of motile cells, but its imperfect co-localization with the motility machineries suggests it may promote their assembly indirectly, such as via a role in organisation or structure of the cell poles.

**Abstract:**
Ion channels are necessary for proper water and nutrient absorption in the intestine, thereby supporting cellular metabolism and organismal growth. While a role for Na+ co-transporters and pumps in intestinal nutrient absorption is well defined, how individual K+ uniporters function in this process is poorly understood. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that a gain-of-function mutation in twk-26, which encodes a two-pore domain K+ ion channel orthologous to human KCNK3, facilitates nutrient absorption and suppresses the metabolic and developmental defects caused by loss of DRL-1/FLR-4 signaling. Mutations in drl-1 and flr-4, which encode two unique kinases that are components of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the downstream flr-1 Na+ ion channel, cause severe growth defects, reduced lipid storage, and a dramatic increase in autophagic lysosomes, which mirror dietary restriction phenotypes. We reveal that this dietary restriction phenotype is likely the result of impaired intestinal amino acid absorption, which is restored upon activation of TWK-26. Furthermore, we show that loss of flr-4 disrupts intracellular and extracellular pH gradients, suggesting that the FLR-4 pathway may be necessary to maintain intestinal ion homeostasis and facilitate nutrient absorption. The altered pH gradients in the flr-4 mutant are partially restored by activation of TWK-26, demonstrating a novel role for this K+ ion channel in governing intestinal physiology and metabolism.

**Abstract:**
In the canonical interpretation of dopaminergic neuron activity during Pavlovian conditioning, initially cell firing is triggered by unexpected rewards. Upon learning, activation instead follows the reward-predictive conditioned stimulus, and when expected rewards are withheld, firing is inhibited. However, little is known about dopaminergic neuron activity during the actual learning process in complex operant tasks. Here, we recorded optogenetically identified dopaminergic neurons of ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice training in multiple, successive operant sensory discrimination tasks. A delay between nose-poke choices and trial outcome signals (for reward or punishment) probed for predictive activity. During training, but prior to criterion performance, firing rates signaled correct versus incorrect choices, but prior to outcome signals. Thus, the neurons predicted whether choices would be rewarded, despite the animals' subthreshold behavioral performance. Surprisingly, these neurons also fired after reward delivery, as if the rewards had been unexpected according to the canonical view, but activity was inhibited after punishment signals, as if the reward had been expected after all. These inconsistencies suggest revision of theoretical formulations of dopaminergic neuronal activity to embody multiple roles in temporal difference learning and actor-critic models. Furthermore, on training trials when these neurons predicted that a given choice was correct and would be rewarded, surprisingly, the mice adhered to other non-rewarded and untrained task strategies (e.g., spatial alternation). The DA neurons' reward prediction activity could serve as critic signals for the choices just made. This consistent with the notion that the brain must reconcile multiple Bayesian belief representations during learning.

**Abstract:**
Target of Rapamycin (TOR) complexes and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are crucial signaling hubs that coordinate adaptive responses to environmental inputs. While GPCR-mediated regulation of TOR has been extensively studied, little is known about TOR-mediated regulation of GPCRs. Here, we establish TOR as a regulator of GPCR signaling via its control of receptor endocytosis in the yeast mating system. By pairing fluorescence microscopy with yeast genetic approaches, we identify the machinery that bridges TOR nutrient sensing to GPCR internalization. Furthermore, we find that autophagic machinery is employed during mating to deliver active receptor to the vacuole (lysosome), suppressing the mating pathway. These results demonstrate that TOR regulates the localization and signaling of the yeast mating GPCR in both ligand-dependent and -independent contexts. These pathways are highly conserved, suggesting that TOR-regulation of GPCRs may be a broadly conserved mechanism for integrating competing signals involving metabolic state and external communications.

**Abstract:**
The language of biology, encoded in DNA, RNA, and proteins, forms the foundation of life but remains challenging to decode due to its complexity. Traditional computational methods often struggle to integrate information across these molecules, limiting a comprehensive understanding of biological systems. Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with pre-trained models offer new possibilities for interpreting biological language. Here, we introduce LucaOne, a pre-trained foundation model trained on nucleic acid and protein sequences from 169,861 species. Through large-scale data integration and semi-supervised learning, LucaOne demonstrates an understanding of key biological principles, such as DNA-Protein translation. Using few-shot learning, it effectively comprehends the central dogma of molecular biology and performs competitively on tasks involving DNA, RNA, or protein inputs. Our results highlight the potential of unified foundation models to address complex biological questions, providing an adaptable framework for bioinformatics research and enhancing the interpretation of life's complexity.

**Abstract:**
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer that is unresponsive to hormonal therapies. One potential TNBC-specific therapeutic target is NQO1, as it is highly expressed in many TNBC patients and lowly expressed in non-cancer tissues. Here we use a derivative of DNQ, isobutyl-deoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ) that is more potent and specific in killing TNBC cells than NQO1-activator {beta}-lapachone while displaying strong NQO1-dependence. We evaluated the cellular signaling changes that occur following 4-hour treatment of TNBC cells with either single agent or combination IB-DNQ and / or PARP inhibitor (Rucaparib). Short treatments (4 hours) with IB-DNQ alone or combined with the PARP inhibitor Rucaparib revealed few changes in protein abundance but significant rapid alterations in protein phosphorylation and thermal stability, with clear synergy in the combination treatment. Key phosphorylated targets linked to RNA Polymerase II inhibition and DNA damage response were altered during our short time treatment. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) identified novel, combination-specific changes in protein biophysical state suggesting new therapeutic vulnerabilities in TNBC cells. Our findings highlight how even brief treatments can uncover distinct biophysical protein changes via TPP, offering a resource for mechanistic studies of IB-DNQ mechanism of action and the development of NQO1-activated therapeutics for TNBC treatment.

**Abstract:**
Accumulation of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the hippocampus triggers cognitive memory decline in Alzheimers disease (AD). The incidence and mortality of sporadic AD were tightly associated with diabetes and hyperlipidemia, while the exact linked molecular is uncertain. Here, we reported that serum Kallistatin concentrations were meaningfully higher in AD patients, with a higher concentration of fasting blood glucose and triglyceride. In addition, the constructed Kallistatin-transgenic (KAL-TG) mice defined its cognitive memory impairment phenotype and lower LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons accompanied by increased A{beta} deposition and tau phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Kallistatin could directly bind to the Notch1 receptor and thereby upregulate BACE1 expression by inhibiting PPAR{gamma} signaling, resulting in A{beta} cleavage and production. Besides, Kallistatin could promote the phosphorylation of tau by activating GSK-3{beta}. Fenofibrate, a hypolipidemic drug, could alleviate cognitive memory impairment by down-regulating A{beta} and tau phosphorylation of KAL-TG mice. Collectively, our data clarified a novel mechanism for A{beta} accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation regulation by Kallistatin, which might play a crucial role in linking metabolic syndromes and cognitive memory deterioration, and suggested that fenofibrate might have the potential for treating metabolism-related AD.

**Abstract:**
Spatial biology experiments integrate the molecular and histological landscape of tissues to provide a previously inaccessible view of tissue biology, unlocking the architecture of complex multicellular tissues. Within spatial biology, spatial transcriptomics platforms are among the most advanced, allowing researchers to characterize the expression of thousands of genes across space. These new technologies are transforming our understanding of how cells are organized in space and communicate with each other to determine emergent phenotypes. This is particularly important in cancer research, as tumor evolution is shaped not only by the genetic properties of cancer cells but also by how they interact with the tumor microenvironment and their spatial organization. While many platforms can generate spatial transcriptomics profiles, it is still unclear in which context each platform better suits the needs of its users. Here we compare the results obtained using 5 different spatial transcriptomics (VISIUM, VISIUM CytAssist, VisiumHD, Xenium, and CosMx) and one spatial proteomics (VISIUM CytAssist) platforms across serial sections of 6 FFPE samples from primary human tumors covering some of the most common forms of the disease (lung, breast, colorectal, bladder, lymphoma and ovary). We observed that the VISIUM platform with CytAssist chemistry yielded superior data quality than manual VISIUM. On the other hand, Xenium consistently produced more reliable results for in situ platforms, with better gene clustering and fewer false positives than CosMx. Importantly, these platform-based variations didn't significantly affect cell type identification. VisiumHD offers the best options of both worlds, with subcellular resolution and whole-transcriptome coverage, albeit with some limitations that need to be accounted for in downstream analyses. Finally, by comparing VISIUM protein profiles with the spatial transcriptomics data from all four platforms on each sample, we identified several genes with mismatched RNA and protein expression patterns, highlighting the importance of multi-omics profiling to reveal the true biology of human tumors.

## Surface Wetting Is a Key Determinant of α-Synuclein Condensate Maturation

**Abstract:**
-Synuclein self-assembles into amyloid fibrils during neurodegeneration. The protein can also self-assemble via liquid-liquid phase separation to form biomolecular condensates. The link between these processes is evident, as -synuclein condensates can mature into amyloids. However, the mechanisms driving this maturation remain largely unknown, particularly when incorporating pathological post-translational modifications known to affect -synuclein self-assembly in the absence of LLPS, such as N-terminal truncation. Moreover, condensates are primarily studied as isolated entities; however, it is increasingly evident that they interact with various cellular components and surfaces. Here, we developed a microscopy-based quantitative real-time imaging protocol to investigate how N-terminal truncation influences -synuclein condensate formation, well surface wetting, and maturation. We found that increasing -synuclein truncation, which reduces N-terminal hydrophobicity, inhibits condensate sedimentation, enhances surface wettability, and accelerates maturation. Additionally, by increasing well surface hydrophobicity we decreased -synuclein condensate wettability, delaying their maturation. Thus, we propose that enhanced wettability, which increases the condensate surface-to-volume ratio, promotes -synuclein nucleation at the condensate-bulk solution interface, thereby accelerating maturation. Our results reveal distinct mechanistic roles for -synuclein N-terminal residues and indicate that condensate wetting on cellular surfaces, such as synaptic vesicles, may drive toxic aggregate formation during neurodegeneration.

**Abstract:**
Spatial transcriptomics technologies aim to localize gene expression in tissues and typically use capture surfaces that have undergone spatial indexing or optical decoding to relate surface sequences to spatial positions. Slide-tags is a recently developed method by Russell et al. that inverts this principle, instead diffusing probes from a pre-decoded bead array into tissues, tagging nuclei with spatial bead barcodes. We reanalyzed this data and discovered a latent, spatially informative cell-bead network formed incidentally as a result of barcode diffusion and the biophysical properties of the tissue. By optimizing proximity constraints encoded in the cell-bead network structure, we could infer cell locations without any spatial indexing, placing Slide-tags among a new generation of optics-free, network-based imaging-by-sequencing approaches, a fundamental departure from classical spatial sequencing technologies based on pre-indexed arrays.

**Abstract:**
Animals must balance the urgent need to find food during starvation with the critical necessity to avoid toxic substances to ensure their survival. In Drosophila, specialized Gustatory Receptors (GRs) expressed in Gustatory Receptor Neurons (GRNs) are critical for distinguishing between nutritious and potentially toxic food. GRNs project their axons from taste organs to the Subesophageal Zone (SEZ) in the Central Brain (CB) of Drosophila, where gustatory information is processed. Although the roles of GRs and GRNs are well-documented, the processing of gustatory information in the SEZ remains unclear. To better understand gustatory sensory processing and feeding decision-making, we molecularly characterized the first layer of gustatory interneurons, referred to as Gustatory Second-Order Neurons (G2Ns), which receive direct input from GRNs. Using trans-synaptic tracing with trans-Tango, cell sorting, and bulk RNAseq under fed and starved conditions, we discovered that G2Ns vary based on gustatory input and that their molecular profile changes with the fly's metabolic state. Further data analysis has revealed that a pair of neurons in the SEZ, expressing the neuropeptide Leucokinin (SELK neurons), receive simultaneous input from GRNs sensing bitter (potentially toxic) and sweet (nutritious) information. Additionally, these neurons also receive inputs regarding the starvation levels of the fly. These results highlight a novel mechanism of feeding regulation and metabolic integration.

Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures support long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and childrens home literacy environments, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to first-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop by birth but undergo further refinement between infancy and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.

Significance StatementReading is crucial for academic, vocational, and health outcomes, but acquiring proficient reading skills is a protracted developmental process involving lower-level subskills and brain structures that undergo rapid development starting in infancy. We examined how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development support long-term acquisition of reading using a reproducible pipeline we developed specifically for infant-to-school-age longitudinal MRI data. Findings suggest that the brain bases of reading-related skills begin to develop by birth but continue building between infancy and preschool. This study emphasizes the importance of considering academic skill acquisition as a dynamic process preceding the emergence of the skill, and it offers a roadmap for future studies to examine relationships between early brain development and academic skill acquisition.

**Abstract:**
Many archaea appear to divide through the coordinated activities of two FtsZ homologues (FtsZ1 and FtsZ2) and another bacterial cell division homologue (SepF), which are part of the midcell division ring. Here, we identify an additional protein (HVO_0739, renamed CdpA) that is involved in cell division in Haloferax volcanii, with homologues in other Haloarchaea. CdpA localizes at the mid-cell division ring, and this requires the presence of the ring-assembly protein FtsZ1. The division constriction protein FtsZ2 also influenced the proper midcell assembly and structure of CdpA. In the absence of CdpA, cells frequently failed to divide properly, and FtsZ1 formed poorly condensed pseudo-helical structures spanning across a broad region of the cell, whereas FtsZ2 showed mispositioned foci, nano-rings, and filaments. The rate of directional movement of FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 structures around the division ring appeared minimally affected by loss of CdpA, which resulted in continual repositioning of the aberrant FtsZ structures in the cells. In contrast to the FtsZ proteins, CdpA formed relatively immobile foci around the ring. Protein domain function studies, pull-down assays, and multimer structure predictions suggest that CdpA is part of a membrane complex that tethers FtsZ2 and other division proteins to the midcell membrane. Our discovery of an archaeal FtsZ organisation and midcell anchor protein offers new insights into cell division mechanisms that are similar across the tree of life.

**Abstract:**
The organization of cell-cell contacts is fundamental for multi-cellular life and operation of organs. Synapses, prototypic contact sites for neuronal communication, are key to brain function and work over the last decades identified multiple synaptic cell adhesion molecules (sCAMs) that drive their organization. Whether these sCAMs operate independently or in coordination through yet unknown linker proteins remained elusive. Here, we used a systematic large-scale multi-epitope affinity-purification approach combined with quantitative mass spectrometry and immuno-EM to comprehensively map trans-synaptic protein networks in the mouse brain. We discover a presynaptic core-module assembled from the two major sCAM families, Neurexins1-3 and LAR-type receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRD,S,F), and the previously uncharacterized tetraspanin proteins T178A, B. These ternary Neurexin-T178-PTPR complexes form through their transmembrane domains and assemble during biogenesis in the ER. Loss of T178B results in module dissociation, strong reduction of LAR-PTPRs and redistribution of synaptic Neurexins. At synapses, the Neurexin-T178-PTPR module recruits stable and extended trans-synaptic protein networks with defined pre- and post-synaptic partners and secreted extracellular linkers. The network architecture robustly interlinks the distinct functional modules/machineries of the presynaptic active zone and establishes tight associations with XKR-type lipid scramblases and postsynaptic GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors. Our data identify a universal presynaptic core-module for synaptic adhesion and trans-synaptic signaling in the mammalian brain.

**Abstract:**
Cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography provide crucial experimental data for obtaining atomic-detail models of biomacromolecules. Refining these models relies on library-based stereochemical restraints, which, in addition to being limited to known chemical entities, do not include meaningful noncovalent interactions relying solely on nonbonded repulsions. Quantum mechanical (QM) calculations could alleviate these issues but are too expensive for large molecules. We present a novel AI-enabled Quantum Refinement (AQuaRef) based on AIMNet2 neural network potential mimicking QM at substantially lower computational costs. By refining 41 cryo-EM and 30 X-ray structures, we show that this approach yields atomic models with superior geometric quality compared to standard techniques, while maintaining an equal or better fit to experimental data. Notably, AQuaRef aids in determining proton positions, as illustrated in the challenging case of short hydrogen bonds in the parkinsonism-associated human protein DJ-1 and its bacterial homolog YajL.

**Abstract:**
Background: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane-bound receptors that transmit critical signals from extracellular to intracellular spaces. Transcriptomic data of resected breast tumors show that low mRNA expression of orphan GPCR GPR52 correlates with reduced overall survival in patients with breast cancer, leading to the hypothesis that loss of GPR52 supports breast cancer progression. Methods: CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knockout GPR52 in the human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, and in the non-cancerous breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. 2D and 3D in vitro studies, electron microscopy, Matrigel culture, and a zebrafish xenograft model were used to assess the morphology and behavior of GPR52 KO cells. RNA-sequencing and proteomic analyses were also conducted on these cell lines, and transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to compare GPR52-null and wild-type (WT) signatures in breast cancer. Results: Loss of GPR52 was found to be associated with increased cell-cell interaction in 2D cultures, altered 3D spheroid morphology, and increased propensity to organize and invade collectively in Matrigel. Furthermore, GPR52 loss was associated with features of EMT in MDA-MB-468 cells, and zebrafish injected with GPR52 KO cells developed a greater total cancer area than those injected with control cells. RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses of GPR52-null breast cancer cells revealed an increased cAMP signaling signature. Consistently, we found that treatment of wild-type (WT) cells with forskolin, which stimulates the production of cAMP, induces phenotypic changes associated with GPR52 loss, and inhibition of cAMP production rescued some GPR52 KO phenotypes. Conclusion: GPR52 is an orphan GPCR and its role in cancer progression has not been previously characterized. We found that GPR52 loss in breast cancer cells can lead to increased cell clustering, collective invasion, and EMT in vitro. These are features of increased cancer aggression. Our results reveal that GPR52 loss is a potential mechanism by which breast cancer progression may occur and support the investigation of GPR52 agonism as a therapeutic option for breast cancer.

**Abstract:**
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) occur primarily in the small intestine, lung and pancreas. Due to their rarity compared to other malignancies in these organs, their complex biology remains poorly understood, including their oncogenesis, tumor composition and the intriguing phenomena of mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN). Here we profiled ten low-grade small intestine NET (SiNET) tumor samples as well as one mixed lung tumor by single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq. We find that SiNETs are largely separated into two distinct subtypes, in which the neuroendocrine cells upregulate epithelial or neuronal markers, respectively. Surprisingly, in both subtypes the neuroendocrine cells are largely non-proliferative while higher proliferation is observed in multiple non-malignant cell types. Specifically, B and plasma cells are highly proliferative in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype, potentially reflecting the outcome of high Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) expression in those tumors, which may constitute a relevant target. Finally, our analysis of a mixed lung neuroendocrine tumor identifies a population of putative progenitor cells that may give rise to both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (squamous) cells, potentially explaining the origin of the mixed histology. Taken together, our results provide important insights and hypotheses regarding the biology of neuroendocrine neoplasms.

**Abstract:**
Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced our understanding of meaning representation in the human brain. However, increasingly large LLMs have been questioned as valid cognitive models due to their extensive training data and their ability to access context hundreds of words long. In this study, we investigated whether instruction tuning, another core technique in recent LLMs beyond mere scaling, can enhance models' ability to capture linguistic information in the human brain. We evaluated the self-attention of base and fine-tuned LLMs of different sizes against human eye movement and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity patterns during naturalistic reading. We show that scaling has a greater impact than instruction tuning on model-brain alignment, reinforcing the scaling law in brain encoding performance. These finding have significant implications for understanding the cognitive plausibility of LLMs and their role in studying naturalistic language comprehension.

**Abstract:**
Intravital microscopy (IVM) enables live imaging of animals at single-cell level, offering essential insights into cancer progression. This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological and dynamic single cell features. BEHAV3D-TP integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers without advanced computational expertise to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.

**Abstract:**
Sound encoding depends on the precise and reliable neurotransmission at the afferent synapses between the sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation, as well as interplay between the pre- and postsynaptic components remain largely unclear. Here, we tested the role of the synaptic adhesion molecule and Nogo/RTN4 receptor homolog RTN4RL2 (also referred to as NgR2) in the development and function of afferent IHC-SGN synapses. Upon deletion of RTN4RL2 in mice (RTN4RL2-/-), presynaptic IHC active zones showed enlarged synaptic ribbons and a depolarized shift in the activation of CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels. The postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of SGNs were smaller and deficient of GluA2-4 despite maintained Gria2 mRNA expression in SGNs. Next to synaptically engaged PSDs we observed &#x0022orphan&#x0022 PSDs located away from IHCs. They likely belong to a subset of SGN peripheral neurites that do not contact the IHCs in RTN4RL2-/- cochleae as found by volume electron microscopy reconstruction of SGN neurites. Auditory brainstem responses of RTN4RL2-/- mice showed increased sound thresholds indicating impaired hearing. Together, these findings suggest that RTN4RL2 contributes to the proper formation and function of auditory afferent synapses and is critical for normal hearing.

**Abstract:**
Yeast Def1 promotes transcription elongation and RNA polymerase II degradation during genotoxic stress. Def1 is cytoplasmic, and DNA damage signals cause its proteolytic processing, liberating its N-terminus to enter the nucleus. Cytoplasmic functions for this abundant protein have not been identified. Proximity-labeling (BioID) experiments indicate that Def1 binds many proteins involved in posttranscriptional control and translation of mRNAs. Deleting DEF1 reduces both mRNA synthesis and decay rates and directly tethering Def1 to a reporter mRNA suppressed expression, suggesting that Def1 directly regulates mRNAs post-transcriptionally. Surprisingly, we found that Def1 interacts with polyribosomes, which requires its N-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain and ubiquitylation of eS7a (Rsp7A) in the small subunit of the ribosome by the Not4 protein in the Ccr4-Not complex. Ribo-seq analysis revealed that deleting DEF1 affected the translation efficiency of a specific subset of transcripts, a genome-wide shift in ribosome footprints on mRNAs and an increase in the dwelling of ribosomes at non-optimal codons. This, together with the high sensitivity of def1{Delta} to translation inhibitors further suggest impaired translation. The polyglutamine-rich unstructured C-terminus of Def1 is required for its interaction with decay and translation factors, suggesting that Def1 acts as a ubiquitin-dependent scaffold to link translation status to mRNA decay. Thus, we have identified a novel function for this transcription and DNA damage response factor in post-transcriptional regulation in the cytoplasm and establish Def1 as a master regulator of gene expression, functioning from transcription to translation.

**Abstract:**
SomaScan and Olink are affinity-based platforms that aim to estimate the relative abundance of thousands of human proteins with a broad range of endogenous concentrations. In this study, we investigated the effects of in vitro hemolysis and repeated freeze-thaw cycles in protein abundance quantification across 10,776 (11K SomaScan) and 1472 (Olink Explore 1536) analytes, respectively. Using SomaScan, we found two distinct groups, each one consisting of 4% of all aptamers, affected by either hemolysis or freeze-thaw cycles. Using Olink, we found 6% of analytes affected by freeze-thaw cycles and nearly half of all measured probes significantly impacted by hemolysis. Moreover, we observed that Olink probes affected by hemolysis target proteins with a larger number of annotated protein-protein interactions. We found that Olink probes affected by hemolysis were significantly associated with the erythrocyte proteome, whereas SomaScan probes were not. Given the extent of the observed nuisance effects, we propose that unbiased, quantitative methods of evaluating hemolysis, such as the hemolysis index successfully implemented in many clinical laboratories, should be adopted in proteomics studies. We provide detailed results for each SomaScan and Olink probe in the form of extensive Supplementary Data files to be used as resources for the growing user communities of both platforms.

**Abstract:**
Social cognition develops through a complex interplay between neural maturation and environmental factors, yet the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Using a naturalistic fMRI paradigm, we investigated the effects of age and parental caregiving on social brain development and Theory of Mind (ToM) in 34 mother-child dyads. The functional maturity of social brain networks was positively associated with age, while mother-child neural synchronization during movie viewing was related to dyadic relationship quality. Crucially, parenting and child factors interactively shaped social cognition outcomes, mediated by ToM abilities. Our findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay of neurocognitive development and interpersonal synchrony in early childhood social cognition, and provide novel evidence for Bandura's theory of social learning and reciprocal determinism. This integrative approach, bridging brain, behavior, and parenting environment, advances our understanding of the complex mechanisms shaping social cognition. The insights gained can inform personalized interventions promoting social competence, emphasizing the critical importance of nurturing parental relationships in facilitating healthy social development.

**Abstract:**
The emerging electron microscopy connectome datasets provides connectivity maps of the brains at single cell resolution, enabling us to estimate various network statistics, such as connectedness. We desire the ability to assess how the functional complexity of these networks depends on these network statistics. To this end, we developed an analysis pipeline and a statistic, XORness, which quantifies the functional complexity of these networks with varying network statistics. We illustrate that actual connectomes have high XORness, as do generated connectomes with the same network statistics, suggesting a normative role for functional complexity in guiding the evolution of connectomes, and providing clues to guide the development of artificial neural networks.

## Bioinformatic discovery of type 11 secretion system (T11SS) cargo across the Proteobacteria

**Abstract:**
Type 11 secretion systems (T11SS) are broadly distributed among proteobacteria, with more than 3,000 T11SS family outer membrane proteins (OMPs) comprising 10 major sequence similarity network (SSN) clusters. Of these, only 7, all from animal-associated cluster 1, have been experimentally verified as secretins of cargo, including adhesins, hemophores, and metal binding proteins. To identify novel cargo of a more diverse set of T11SS, we identified gene families co-occurring in gene neighborhoods with either cluster 1 or marine microbe-associated cluster 3 T11SS OMP genes. We developed bioinformatic controls to ensure perceived co-occurrences are specific to T11SS, and not general to OMPs. We found that both cluster 1 and cluster 3 T11SS OMPs frequently co-occur with single carbon metabolism and nucleotide synthesis pathways, but that only cluster 1 T11SS OMPs had significant co-occurrence with metal and heme pathways, as well as with mobile genetic islands, potentially indicating diversified function of this cluster. Cluster 1 T11SS co-occurrences included 2,556 predicted cargo proteins, unified by the presence of a C-terminal {beta}-barrel domain, which fall into 141 predicted UniRef50 clusters and approximately 10 different architectures: 4 similar to known cargo and 6 uncharacterized types. We experimentally demonstrate T11SS-dependent secretion of an uncharacterized cargo type with homology to Plasmin sensitive protein (Pls). Unexpectedly, genes encoding marine cluster 3 T11SS OMPs only rarely co-occurred with the C-terminal {beta}-barrel domain and instead frequently co-occurred with DUF1194-containing genes. Overall, our results show that with sufficiently large-scale and controlled genomic data, T11SS-dependent cargo proteins can be accurately predicted.

**Abstract:**
Kinetochores link chromosomes to dynamic microtubules of the mitotic spindle. To ensure equal chromosome segregation, sister chromatids must achieve biorientation. The conserved kinase Aurora B phosphorylates outer kinetochore proteins on attachments lacking tension, allowing re-establishment of new connections until biorientation is achieved. Aurora B localizes to the centromere as part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), but the underlying recruitment pathways can be eliminated without disrupting biorientation. It therefore remains unclear how the kinase operates during error correction. Here, we identify the conserved Spc105/Kre28 complex as an outer kinetochore receptor of the Aurora kinase Ipl1 and its activator Sli15 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that mutations in the helix bundle domain of Spc105/Kre28 impair mitotic error correction, resembling the effects of ipl1 or sli15 mutants. The defects can be suppressed by artificial recruitment of Ipl1. In biochemical experiments Ipl1/Sli15 directly associates with Spc105/Kre28, and a conserved segment in the Sli15 central domain is crucially involved in the binding mechanism. These results have important implications for the mechanism of tension-dependent error correction during chromosome biorientation.

## Mapping grey and white matter activity in the human brain with isotropic ADC-fMRI

**Abstract:**
Functional MRI (fMRI) using the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal provides valuable insight into grey matter activity. However, uncertainty surrounds the white matter BOLD signal. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) offers an alternative fMRI contrast sensitive to transient cellular deformations during neural activity, facilitating detection of both grey and white matter activity. Further, through minimising vascular contamination, ADC-fMRI has the potential to overcome the limited temporal specificity of the BOLD signal. However, the use of linear diffusion encoding introduces sensitivity to fibre directionality, while averaging over multiple directions comes at great cost to temporal resolution. In this study, we used spherical b-tensor encoding to impart diffusion sensitisation in all directions per shot, providing an ADC-fMRI contrast capable of detecting activity independently of fibre directionality. We provide evidence from two task-based experiments on a clinical scanner that isotropic ADC-fMRI is more temporally specific than BOLD-fMRI, and offers more balanced mapping of grey and white matter activity. We further demonstrate that isotropic ADC-fMRI detects white matter activity independently of fibre direction, while linear ADC-fMRI preferentially detects activity in voxels containing fibres perpendicular to the diffusion encoding direction. Thus, isotropic ADC-fMRI opens avenues for investigation into whole-brain grey and white matter functional connectivity.

**Abstract:**
Kinesin motor proteins facilitate microtubule-based transport by converting chemical energy into mechanic forces, but this activity is autoinhibited until cargo is loaded. Regulatory mechanisms underlying this autoinhibitory conformation are not well understood. Here, we show that a NEver in mitosis Kinase NEKL-3 directly phosphorylates a flexible elbow region between two coiled coil domains connecting the motor head and tail of an intraflagellar transport kinesin, OSM-3. The phosphor dead (PD) mutation, but not phosphor mimic (PM) mutation, induce constitutive motility of OSM-3 in vitro. Using knock-in animals, we discovered that both PD and PM mutations shorten the C. elegans sensory cilia. The constitutively active OSM-3PD fails to enter cilia and abnormally accumulates in neurites, mimicking another hyperactive mutation, OSM-3G444E. Conversely, OSM-3PM enters cilia but moves at a reduced speed, indicating an inhibitory role of elbow phosphorylation in kinesin motility. These findings highlight the crucial role of elbow phosphorylation in regulating kinesin autoinhibition.

**Abstract:**
The Flower protein was suggested to couple the fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) to their recycling in different model organisms. It is supposed to trigger activity-dependent bulk endocytosis by conducting Ca2+ at endocytic sites. However, this mode of action is debated. Here, we investigated the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog FLWR-1 in neurotransmission. Our results confirm that FLWR-1 facilitates the recycling of SVs at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Ultrastructural analysis of synaptic boutons after hyperstimulation revealed an accumulation of large endocytic structures in flwr1 mutants. These findings do not support a role of FLWR-1 in the formation of bulk endosomes but rather a function in their breakdown. Unexpectedly, loss of FLWR-1 led to increased neuronal Ca2+ levels in axon terminals during stimulation, particularly in GABAergic motor neurons, causing excitation-inhibition imbalance. We found that this increased NMJ transmission might be caused by deregulation of MCA-3, the nematode orthologue of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA). In vivo molecular interactions indicated that FLWR-1 may be a positive regulator of the PMCA and might influence its recycling through modification of plasma membrane levels of PI(4,5)P2.

**Abstract:**
Membrane pore-forming proteins (PFPs) form ring-shaped membrane-translocating oligomers on membranes, contributing to infection, immunity, and cell death functions. Binary toxins produced by some bacteria consist of an enzymatic component that acts as a toxin and a membrane-binding component that forms a pore that delivers the enzymatic component into target cells. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has advanced our understanding of these translocation mechanisms by revealing several binary toxin complexes structures. However, the mechanisms underlying the initial pore formation remain unclear. We determined the structures of several oligomeric forms of the membrane-binding component, Ib, of the Iota toxin from Clostridium perfringens at various stages of pore formation. Structural comparisons revealed that the symmetrically arranged soluble oligomer (prepore) became a transmembrane oligomer (pore). These findings enhance our understanding of the PFP mechanisms and provide a structural basis for developing nanodevices using membrane pores.

**Abstract:**
Biological processes are fundamentally dynamic, yet existing methods for capturing these temporal changes are limited. We present scDynaBar, a novel approach that integrates CRISPR-Cas9 dynamic barcoding with single-cell sequencing to enable the recording of temporal cellular events. In this system, genetic barcodes accumulate mutations over a 25-day period and then are sequenced together with the transcriptome of each single cell. We propose that this gradual accumulation of genetic diversity can be exploited to create an ordered record of a cellular event. We apply this approach to track the transition from a pluripotent state to a two-cell (2C)-like state in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The results provide compelling evidence for the transient nature of the 2C-like state. Additionally, our system shows consistent mutation rates across diverse cell types in a mouse gastruloid model, underscoring its robustness and versatility across various biological contexts. This technique not only improves our ability to study single-cell dynamics but also creates new opportunities for recording other temporal signals, in other words, using dynamic barcoding as a molecular clock in individual cells.

**Abstract:**
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that represent the largest and most therapeutically targeted receptor class, accounting for 30% of currently marketed drugs. Two binding motifs for membrane cholesterol, the cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) domain and the cholesterol consensus motif (CCM), have been postulated. Using a simulation of the molecular dynamics of cholesterol association with the receptor, we predicted the binding of membrane cholesterol to non-canonical sites, distinct from CRAC and CCM, at muscarinic and opioid receptors. We identified a binding site common to muscarinic and opioid receptors at TM6, with arginine 6.35 as the major residue. Membrane cholesterol depletion mimics the effects of R6.35 mutations, confirming its role in receptor modulation. Targeting cholesterol-binding sites offers novel pharmacotherapeutic strategies, including tissue-specific sterol-based modulation.

**Abstract:**
Systemic inflammation can lead to neuroinflammation with acute consequences such as delirium and long-lasting deleterious effects including cognitive decline and the exacerbation of neurodegenerative disease progression. Here we show that transcription factor Nrf2 controls brain endothelial cell homeostasis and barrier strength. We found that peripheral inflammation caused infiltration of macrophages, microglial activation and inflammatory reactive astrogliosis, all of which could be prevented by RTA-404, an activator of the transcription factor Nrf2 and close structural relative of the recently FDA-approved Nrf2 activator RTA-408 (Omaveloxolone). To identify the key cellular mediator(s), we generated an endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 knockout mouse. Strikingly, the effects of RTA-404 on brain endothelial activation and downstream neuroinflammatory events was abolished by endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 deletion. This places endothelial cell Nrf2 as a peripherally accessible therapeutic target to reduce the CNS-adverse consequences of systemic inflammation.

**Abstract:**
As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge capable of evading neutralizing antibodies, it has become increasingly important to fully understand the breadth and functional profile of T cell responses to determine their impact on the immune surveillance of variant strains. Here, sampling healthy individuals, we profiled the kinetics and polyfunctionality of T cell immunity elicited by mRNA vaccination. Modeling of anti-spike T cell responses against ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that epitope immunodominance and cross-reactivity are major predictive determinants of T cell immunity. To identify immunodominant epitopes across the viral proteome, we generated a comprehensive map of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes within non-spike proteins that induced polyfunctional T cell responses in convalescent patients. We found that immunodominant epitopes mainly resided within regions that were minimally disrupted by mutations in emerging variants. Conservation analysis across historical human coronaviruses combined with in silico alanine scanning mutagenesis of non-spike proteins underscored the functional importance of mutationally-constrained immunodominant regions. Collectively, these findings identify immunodominant T cell epitopes across the mutationally-constrained SARS-CoV-2 proteome, potentially providing immune surveillance against emerging variants, and inform the design of next-generation vaccines targeting antigens throughout SARS-CoV-2 proteome for broader and more durable protection.

**Abstract:**
Plasma membrane rupture and the release of cytosolic contents are hallmarks of necrotic cell death. The plasma membrane protein ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) actively promotes cell lysis by polymerizing into membrane embedded filaments that induce the formation of large plasma membrane lesions. Yet the signals controlling NINJ1 oligomerization and lesion opening remain unknown. Here, we combine cell biology and biophysical measurements to characterize the steps preceding NINJ1-induced PMR. Our results show that NINJ1 lesions form through a 2-step mechanism requiring oligomerization, which is triggered by signal 1, and subsequent lesion opening driven by signal 2, which we determine to be cell swelling without a concomitant increase in intracellular pressure. The close homolog NINJ2 oligomerizes with similar kinetics to NINJ1 but fails to form lesions during cell swelling. NINJ1-NINJ2 chimeras identify that the unstructured N-terminal region of NINJ1 controls lesion opening. In summary, our data establish a 2-step model for NINJ1-driven necrosis.

**Abstract:**
Tandem repeats (TRs) - highly polymorphic, repetitive sequences dispersed across the human genome - are crucial regulators of gene expression and diverse biological processes, but have remained underexplored relative to other classes of genetic variation due to historical challenges in their accurate calling and analysis. Here, we leverage whole genome and single-cell RNA sequencing from over 5.4 million blood-derived cells from 1,925 individuals to explore the impact of variation in over 1.7 million polymorphic TR loci on blood cell type-specific gene expression. We identify over 62,000 single-cell expression quantitative trait TR loci (sc-eTRs), 16.6% of which are specific to one of 28 distinct immune cell types. Further fine-mapping uncovers 4,283 sc-eTRs as candidate causal drivers of gene expression in 13.6% of genes tested genome-wide. We show through colocalization that TRs are likely mediators of genetic associations with immune-mediated and hematological traits in over 700 genes, and further identify novel TRs warranting investigation in rare disease cohorts. TRs are critical, yet long-overlooked, contributors to cell type-specific gene expression, with implications for understanding rare disease pathogenesis and the genetic architecture of complex traits.

**Abstract:**
Structural covariance in brain anatomy is thought to reflect inter-regional sharing of developmental influences - although this hypothesis has proved hard to causally test. Here, we use neuroimaging in humans and mice to study sex-differences in anatomical covariance - asking if regions that have developed shared sex differences in volume also show shared sex differences in volume covariance. This study design illuminates both the biology of sex-differenes and theoretical models for anatomical covariance - benefitting from tests of inter-species convergence. We find that volumetric structural covariance is stronger in adult females compared to adult males for both wild-type mice and healthy human subjects: 98% of all comparisons with statistically significant covariance sex differences in mice are female-biased, while 76% of all such comparisons are female-biased in humans (q < 0.05). In both species, a region's covariance and volumetric sex-biases have weak inverse relationships to each other: volumetrically male-biased regions contain more female-biased covariation (mice: r = -0.185, p = 0.002; humans: r = -0.189, p = 0.001). Our results identify a conserved tendency for females to show stronger neuroanatomical covariance than males, evident across species, which suggests that stronger structural covariance in females could be an evolutionarily conserved feature that is partially related to volumetric alterations through sex.

**Abstract:**
AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCurrent electrophysiological approaches can track the activity of many neurons, yet it is usually unknown which cell-types or brain areas are being recorded without further molecular or histological analysis. Developing accurate and scalable algorithms for identifying the cell-type and brain region of recorded neurons is thus crucial for improving our understanding of neural computation. In this work, we develop a multimodal contrastive learning approach for neural data that can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks, including inference of cell-type and brain location. We utilize this approach to jointly embed the activity autocorrelations and extracellular waveforms of individual neurons. We demonstrate that our embedding approach, Neuronal Embeddings via MultimOdal contrastive learning (NEMO), paired with supervised fine-tuning, achieves state-of-the-art cell-type classification for two opto-tagged datasets and brain region classification for the public International Brain Laboratory Brain-wide Map dataset. Our method represents a promising step towards accurate cell-type and brain region classification from electrophysiological recordings.

**Abstract:**
Mitochondria, the double membrane-bound organelles of endosymbiotic origin, are crucial centers for cellular energy production and several essential metabolic pathways. Recent studies reveal that mitochondria become dysfunctional following numerous cellular stresses, and during pathologies, demanding an extensive investigation of mitochondrial turnover mechanisms. Apart from the specific response pathways to tackle different stresses, mitophagy or degradation of mitochondria by autophagy is a critical quality control mechanism that clears irreversibly damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy is majorly executed either by receptor-mediated or PINK-Parkin-dependent pathways. Here, we show that the human orthologue of yeast Vms1, ANKZF1, participates in PINK-Parkin-mediated mitophagy. We show that ANKZF1 is extensively recruited to damaged mitochondria along with Parkin during mitochondrial proteotoxic stress induced by the expression of a single misfolded/aggregated protein or during uncoupler-induced membrane depolarization. Importantly, ANKZF1 recruitment to damaged mitochondria is significantly enhanced in the presence of Parkin, and ANKZF1 physically interacts with Parkin and LC3 during mitochondrial proteotoxic or depolarization stresses. ANKZF1 harbors six putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs), LIR4 present at residues 333-336 is particularly important for ANKZF1-LC3 interaction. Furthermore, we show that ANKZF1 knockout cells are compromised in clearing stress-damaged mitochondria by mitophagy, indicating an important role of ANKZF1 in mitochondrial turnover during stress. In summary, we show a new role of ANKZF1 in eliminating the stress-damaged mitochondria, reiterating the mito-protective role of Vms1/ANKZF1 during mitochondrial stresses.

## Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate restores TDP-43 pathology-driven genome repair deficiency in motor neuron diseases

**Abstract:**
TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In our recent discovery, we identified that TDP-43 plays an essential role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair via the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. Here, we found persistent DNA damage in the brains of ALS/FTD patients, primarily in the transcribed regions of the genome. We further investigated the underlying mechanism and found that polynucleotide kinase 3-phosphatase (PNKP) activity was severely impaired in the nuclear extracts of both patient brains and TDP-43-depleted cells. PNKP is a key player in DSB repair within the transcribed genome, where its 3-P termini processing activity is crucial for preventing persistent DNA damage and neuronal death. The inactivation of PNKP in ALS/FTD was due to reduced levels of its interacting partner, phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose 2,6 bisphosphatase (PFKFB3), and its biosynthetic product, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), an allosteric modulator of glycolysis. Recent work from our group has shown that F2,6BP acts as a positive modulator of PNKP activity in vivo. Notably, exogenous supplementation with F2,6BP restored PNKP activity in nuclear extracts from ALS/FTD brain samples and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells harboring pathological mutations. Supplementation of F2,6BP also reduced the pathogenic phosphorylation of TDP-43 and cytosolic protein aggregation, both hallmarks of ALS pathology, in patient-derived mutant cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that supplementation of F2,6BP restores genome integrity and partially rescues motor phenotype in a Drosophila model of ALS. Our findings underscore the possibility of exploring the therapeutic potential of F2,6BP or its analogs in TDP-43 pathology-associated motor neuron diseases.

## Astrocytic connexin43 phosphorylation contributes to seizure susceptibility after mild Traumatic Brain Injury

**Abstract:**
Astrocytes play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis through functional gap junctions (GJs) primarily formed by connexin43 (Cx43) in the cortical gray matter. These GJs facilitate electrical and metabolic coupling between astrocytes, allowing the passage of ions, glucose, and metabolites. Dysregulation of Cx43 has been implicated in various pathologies, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired epilepsy. After mild TBI/concussion, we previously identified a subset of atypical astrocytes, which are correlated with the development of spontaneous seizures. These astrocytes exhibit reduced Cx43 expression and coupling. However, atypical astrocytes represent a relatively small subset of astrocytes within the cortical gray matter and previous studies suggest an overall increase of Cx43 protein after TBI. Additionally, Cx43 also has non-junctional and channel-independent functions, which include hemichannel communication with the extracellular milieu, cell adhesion, protein trafficking, protein-protein interactions, and intracellular signaling. In the present study, we set out to determine how mild TBI initiates alterations to Cx43 protein expression and localization, how they may be regulated, and whether they contribute to seizure susceptibility. We demonstrate remarkable heterogeneity of Cx43 protein levels from astrocyte to astrocyte. In accordance with our previous findings, a subset of astrocytes lost Cx43 expression, yet total cortical Cx43 protein increased. At the subcellular level, junctional Cx43 protein levels remained stable, while hemichannels and/or cytoplasmic Cx43 were increased. Phosphorylation of Cx43 at serine 368, a key regulatory site influencing GJ assembly and function, increased after mild TBI. Critically, Cx43S368A mutant mice, lacking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. These findings suggest that TBI-induced Cx43 phosphorylation enhances seizure susceptibility, while inhibiting this modification presents a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure development.

Significance statementConnexin43 (Cx43) is the main protein comprising astrocyte gap junctions which mediate astrocyte coupling into cellular networks, but it also has other non-junctional functions. Many pathologies present with altered Cx43 regulation. In this study, we assessed Cx43 alterations after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a mouse model. We found that while some astrocytes lost Cx43 expression, other astrocytes had increased cytoplasmic and hemichannel Cx43. This increase correlated with an increase in phosphorylated Cx43 at serine 368. Cx43S368A mutant mice, lacking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced susceptibility to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). These findings suggest that TBI-induced Cx43 phosphorylation enhances seizure susceptibility.

**Abstract:**
Protein abundance tends to be more evolutionarily conserved than mRNA levels both within and between species, yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are widespread cis-regulatory elements in eukaryotic genomes that regulate translation, but it remains unclear whether and how uORFs contribute to stabilizing protein levels. In this study, we performed ribosome translation simulations on mRNA to quantitatively assess the extent to which uORF translation influences the translational variability of downstream coding sequences (CDSs) across varying contexts. Our simulations revealed that uORF translation dampens CDS translational variability, with buffering capacity increasing in proportion to uORF efficiency, length, and number. We then compared the translatomes at different developmental stages of two Drosophila species, demonstrating that uORFs buffer mRNA translation fluctuations during both evolution and development. Experimentally, deleting a uORF in the bicoid (bcd) gene-a prominent example of translational buffering-resulted in extensive changes in gene expression and phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster. Additionally, we observed uORF-mediated buffering between primates and within human populations. Together, our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which uORFs stabilize gene translation during development and across evolutionary time.

**Abstract:**
Protein-small molecule interactions, or receptor-ligand interactions, are essential for understanding biological processes and advancing drug design. Despite advancements, existing prediction models of these interactions still lack the capabilities and accuracy needed to replace traditional screening. In this paper, we introduce DockFormer, a method that leverages multi-modal learning to predict both the binding affinity and structure of these interactions. DockFormer employs fully flexible docking, where no part of the receptor remains rigid, by adapting the AlphaFold2 architecture. Instead of relying on protein sequences and Multiple Sequence Alignments, DockFormer uses predicted receptor structures as input. This modification enables the model to concentrate on ligand docking prediction rather than protein folding, while preserving full receptor flexibility. The streamlined design also reduces the model size to just 8 layers, compared to AlphaFold2's 48 layers, greatly accelerating the inference process and making it more efficient for large-scale screening. When evaluated on affinity benchmarks such as CASF-2016, PLINDER, and the recently released CASP16 ligand screening benchmark, DockFormer performs comparably to or better than state-of-the-art methods, which typically rely on templates or bound structures as input. On structural benchmarks such as Posebusters and PLINDER, DockFormer demonstrated success rates of 20% and 15%, respectively.

**Abstract:**
Genetically modified, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising allogeneic source for the generation of functionally enhanced, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. However, the signaling of CARs during early T cell development and the removal of the endogenous T cell receptor required to prevent alloreactivity pose significant challenges to the production of mature conventional CAR T cells from iPSCs. Here, we show that TCR-null, CD8{beta} CAR T cells can be efficiently generated from iPSCs by engineering stage-specific onset of CAR expression and signaling to both permit conventional T cell development and to induce efficient positive selection. CAR T cells produced using this approach displayed a uniform, naive T cell phenotype and demonstrated superior antigen-specific cytotoxicity compared to iPSC-derived effector memory CAR T cells. Multimodal sequencing revealed CAR-mediated positive selection induced the persistent upregulation of key transcription factors involved in naive T cell development. Achieving precise control of CAR expression and signaling in developmentally sensitive T precursors will be critical to realizing the full potential for "off-the-shelf", iPSC-derived cellular therapies.

**Abstract:**
Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) provides high-resolution imaging and morphological information over large fields of view, while Computational Scattered Light Imaging (ComSLI) excels at mapping interwoven fiber organization in unstained tissue sections. This study introduces Fourier Ptychographic Scattered Light Microscopy (FP-SLM), a new multi-modal approach that combines FPM and ComSLI analyses to create both high-resolution phase-contrast images and fiber orientation maps from a single dataset. The method is demonstrated on a state-of-the-art setup that was originally used for FPM and one that was originally used for ComSLI, and the outputs are quantitatively compared to each other on brain sections (frog, monkey) and sections from thigh muscle and knee (mouse). FP-SLM delivers high-resolution images while revealing fiber organization in nerve, muscle, tendon, cartilage, and bone tissues. The approach is validated by comparing the computed fiber orientations with those derived from structure tensor analysis of the high-resolution images. The comparison shows that FPM and ComSLI are compatible with each other and yield fully consistent results. Remarkably, this combination surpasses the sum of its parts, so that applying ComSLI analysis to FPM recordings and vice-versa outperforms both methods alone. FP-SLM can be retrospectively applied to analyze any existing dataset acquired from a setup that was originally built for FPM or ComSLI alone (consisting of LED array and low numerical aperture), without need to build or design an extra setup. This significantly expands the application range of both techniques and enhances the study of complex tissue architectures in biomedical research.

Here we show that the SEC/MUNC protein KEULE is a dynamic marker for individual secretory events and employ it as a live cell probe, that together with high-precision image analysis of thousands of events, reveal that cortical microtubule arrays act as two-dimensional templates that pattern exocytosis at the nano-scale in higher plant cells. This mechanism is distinct from previously described mechanisms involving motor-driven transport and defines ordered and adjacent linear domains where secretory events are higher and lower than expected, effectively redistributing exocytosis over most of the cell membrane. In addition, analysis of KEULE kinetics revealed distinct phases of assembly/disassembly that are differentially sensitive to experimental treatments that reduce exocytosis, revealing SEC/MUNC dynamics as a versatile and information rich read-out of exocytosis in vivo.

**Abstract:**
Symbiotic systems of photosynthetic microorganisms and fungi are widespread in terrestrial biomes and lichens are probably the most advanced and complex. Conversely, the least complex systems are "green biofilms" with a completely unexplored mycobiome. We describe here a new system intermediate between green biofilms and lichens - semilichens. Light and fluorescence microscopy, eDNA sequencing, molecular phylogeny, Chlorophyll a fluorescence and 13C labelling/metabolomics were used to study algal and fungal identity, morphology and physiology of the symbiosis. Tight contact between algae and a single predominant fungus (mycobiont) is revealed in semilichens. The algae are from the symbiotic lineages of Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae, the fungi belong to Arthoniomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Lecanoromycetes and Lichinomycetes. Algae are alive and perform substantial photosynthetic activity. 13C labelled photosynthates are partially converted into specific fungal polyols (arabitol, mannitol) demonstrating the C-flow from algae to fungi. The new symbiotic system was defined and compared with other terrestrial algal-fungal symbioses. It is characterized by minimalist environmental requirements and extremely low production of biomass. As a result, it also inhabits environments unfavourable for lichens. Our research supports the hypothesis that the long-term existence of algae and fungi in terrestrial conditions affected by frequent and repeated drying is likely dependent on their mutual coexistence.

**Abstract:**
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins crucial to numerous diseases, yet many remain poorly characterized and untargeted by drugs. Chimeric GPCRs have emerged as valuable tools for elucidating GPCR function by facilitating the identification of signaling pathways, resolving structures, and discovering novel ligands of poorly understood GPCRs. Such chimeric GPCRs are obtained by merging a well- and less-well-characterized GPCR at the intracellular limits of their transmembrane regions or intracellular loops, leveraging knowledge transfer from the well-characterized GPCR. However, despite the 212 chimeric GPCRs engineered to date, the design process remains largely trial-and-error and lacks a standardized approach. To address this gap, we introduce GPCRchimeraDB (https://www.bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/), the first comprehensive database dedicated to chimeric GPCRs. It catalogs 212 chimeric receptors, identified through literature review, and includes 1,755 class A natural GPCRs, enabling connections between chimeras and their parent receptors while facilitating the exploration of novel parent combinations. Both chimeric and natural GPCR entries are extensively described at the sequence, structural, and biophysical level through a range of visualization tools, with annotations from resources like UniProt and GPCRdb and predictions from AlphaFold2 and b2btools. Additionally, GPCRchimeraDB offers a GPCR sequence aligner and a feature comparator to investigate differences between natural and chimeric receptors. It also provides design guidelines to support rational chimera engineering. GPCRchimeraDB is therefore a resource to facilitate and optimize the design of new chimeras, so helping to gain insights into poorly characterized receptors and contributing to advances in GPCR therapeutic development.

**Abstract:**
Cytoplasmic inclusions containing TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) are recognized as a major pathological feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Cyclophilin A (PPIA) interacts with TDP-43 and influences its aggregation and function. This interaction is facilitated by PPIA Lys-acetylation. We investigated the effect of lysine deacetylation inhibition to uncover the underlying mechanisms of TDP-43 proteinopathy in relation to PPIA acetylation, and to identify new therapeutic avenues. Through a screening of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in a cellular model of TDP-43 proteinopathy, we identified vorinostat/SAHA, capable of increasing PPIA acetylation, as the most effective in reversing TDP-43 mislocalization. We confirmed its effect in PBMCs from ALS patients and explored its impact on proteinopathy and PPIA acetylation in the Thy1-hTDP-43 mouse model. Thy1-hTDP-43 mice treated with SAHA showed a delayed onset of TDP-43 pathology, associated with PPIA nucleus-cytoplasm redistribution, lower neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, and improved neuromuscular function markers. However, the effect was only temporary. When combined with the heat shock protein (HSP) co-inducer arimoclomol, a mitigation of the neurodegeneration was sustained. A synergistic effect was observed in periphery, greatly enhancing tubulin acetylation and reducing pTDP-43 accumulation in the sciatic nerve and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) {gamma}-subunit expression in gastrocnemius muscle. This study suggests that HDAC inhibition, by increasing acetylated PPIA, could be beneficial in restoring TDP-43 localization and function. The combination of lysine deacetylation inhibition and HSP induction shows a synergistic effect in vivo and has potential as a therapeutic approach for patients.

**Abstract:**
Copious expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is associated with poor survival in many types of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia. We observed that a specific acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) cell line (6133) derived from RBM15-MKL1 knock-in mice exhibited heterogeneity in Prmt1 expression levels. Interestingly, only a subpopulation of 6133 cells expressing high levels of Prmt1 caused leukemia when transplanted into congenic mice. The PRMT1 inhibitor, MS023, effectively cured this PRMT1-driven leukemia. Seahorse analysis revealed that PRMT1 increased the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and decreased the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Consistently, PRMT1 accelerated glucose consumption and led to the accumulation of lactic acid in the leukemia cells. The metabolomic analysis supported that PRMT1 stimulated the intracellular accumulation of lipids, which was further validated by FACS analysis with BODIPY 493/503. In line with fatty acid accumulation, PRMT1 downregulated the protein level of CPT1A, which is involved in the rate-limiting step of fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, administering the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) delayed AMKL progression and promoted cell differentiation. Ectopic expression of Cpt1a rescued the proliferation of 6133 cells ectopically expressing PRMT1 in the glucose-minus medium. In conclusion, PRMT1 upregulates glycolysis and downregulates fatty acid oxidation to enhance the proliferation capability of AMKL cells.

## Small-molecule modulation of Beta-arrestins

**Abstract:**
Beta-arrestins are multifunctional regulators of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, orchestrating diverse downstream signaling events and physiological responses across the vast GPCR superfamily. While GPCR pharmacology has advanced to target orthosteric and allosteric sites, as well as G proteins and GRKs, comparable chemical tools to study beta-arrestins remain lacking. Here, we report the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors that selectively target beta-arrestins and delineate their mechanism of action through integrated pharmacological, biochemical, biophysical, and structural analyses. These inhibitors disrupt beta-arrestin-engagement with agonist-activated GPCRs, impairing desensitization, internalization, and beta-arrestin-dependent functions while sparing G protein-receptor coupling. Cryo-EM, MD simulations, and structure-guided mutagenesis reveal that one modulator, Cmpd-5, engages a cryptic pocket formed by the middle, C-, and lariat loops of beta-arrestin1-a critical receptor-binding interface-stabilizing a distinct conformation incompatible with GPCR engagement. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic framework for beta-arrestin modulation, introducing transducer-targeted strategies to fine-tune GPCR signaling and guide the development of pathway-specific therapeutics.

## Structural insights into heterohexameric assembly of epilepsy-related ligand-receptor complex LGI1-ADAM22

**Abstract:**
Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 protein (LGI1) is a secreted neuronal protein consisting of the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and C-terminal epitempin repeat (EPTP) domains. LGI1 is linked to epilepsy, a neurological disorder that can be caused by genetic mutations of genes regulating neuronal excitability (e.g., voltage- or ligand-gated ion channels). ADAM22 is a membrane receptor that binds to LGI1 extracellularly and interacts with AMPA-type glutamate receptors via PSD-95 intracellularly to maintain normal synaptic signal transmission. Structural analysis of the LGI1-ADAM22 complex is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of epileptogenesis and developing new therapies against epilepsy. We previously reported the crystal structure of a 2:2 complex consisting of two molecules of LGI1 and two molecules of the ADAM22 ectodomain (ECD), which is suggested to bridge neurons across the synaptic cleft. On the other hand, multiangle light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and cryo-EM analyses have suggested the existence of a 3:3 complex consisting of three molecules of LGI1 and three molecules of ADAM22. In the previous cryo-EM analysis, many observed particles were in a dissociated state, making it difficult to determine the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the 3:3 complex. In this study, we stabilized the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complex using chemical crosslinking and determined the cryo-EM structures of the LGI1LRR-LGI1EPTP-ADAM22ECD and 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complexes at 2.78 [A] and 3.79 [A] resolutions, respectively. Furthermore, high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) visualized the structural features and flexibility of the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complex in solution. We discuss new insights into the interaction modes of the LGI1-ADAM22 higher-order complex and the structural properties of the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22 complex.

**Abstract:**
Structural variation, involving large alterations in chromosome structure, drives genetic diversification and the emergence of new phenotypes. These changes are widespread in natural populations and play an important role in adaptation and speciation. For many species, research has been limited to laboratory adapted strains and experimental evolution, which may not reflect the diversity of structural variants in the wild. Furthermore, technological limitations have proved to be a major barrier to accurate and comprehensive variant calling. In this study, we used PacBio sequencing data from 14 wild Caenorhabditis elegans strains to characterize structural variants in a natural population. With long-reads, we overcame limitations associated with short-read approaches and leveraged population-level data to further refine the accuracy of variant calls. We found that large, rapidly evolving gene families, such as GPCR, F-Box, and C-Type lectin, were prominent among the variants predicted to have phenotypic consequences. These results shed light on the significant role of structural variants in the evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans in its wild habitats and the limitations of treating N2 as the reference wild-type.

**Abstract:**
Aims: To standardise and automate the quantitation of human-unique neuromelanin granules in catecholamine neurons in post-mortem tissue sections from healthy individuals at different ages to understand any changes in these granules with age. Methods: 5-6m thick fixed and paraffin-embedded transverse midbrain tissue sections were supplied from 47 cases from three brain banks following ethics approvals. Sections were prepared and automated digital images acquired. Standardisation and automation of the quantification of neuromelanin granules was performed using the TruAI feature of the Olympus VS200 desktop platform. Comparisons between stained and unstained sections as well as correlations with age were performed. Results: The automated platform reliably identified both stained and unstained intracellular and extracellular neuromelanin granules, showing high reproducibility in measurements across laboratories using different tissue processing methods. Extracellular neuromelanin granules were significantly smaller than intracellular neuromelanin granules. Sections processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining impacted on size and colour of both neuromelanin and the neurons containing neuromelanin. Hematoxylin made neuromelanin bluer and the increased tissue processing made the intracellular area occupied by neuromelanin smaller in younger people. There was an increase in neuromelanin optical density and colour change (more brown) with age. Conclusions: The TruAI automated platform reliably quantifies individual neuromelanin granules in catecholamine neurons. Extracellular neuromelanin is considerably smaller in size than intracellular neuromelanin, and intracellular neuromelanin changes its properties with age. The darkening and colour change of intracellular neuromelanin suggests an increase in eumelanin over time in healthy individuals. These changes can be reliably identified using the automated platform.

## The brain dynamics of congenitally blind people seeing faces and letters via sound

**Abstract:**
Sensory substitution devices (SSDs) convert images to sounds to equip blind individuals with nominally visual functions, like face or letter sensitivity. Prior studies showed that image-to-sound SSDs engage cortices ordinarily specialised for visual functions. However, the brain dynamics of SSD-supported perception remains unknown. Either visual cortices are the first locus of discrimination of SSD percepts, or their activation is a byproduct of perceptual processes unfurling elsewhere, such as in auditory cortices. Resolving this uncertainty is critical for understanding the contribution of visual cortices to mechanisms subserving SSD-induced perceptions in the blind. Using electrical neuroimaging of EEG data from congenitally blind adults, we show for the first time that visual cortices are the earliest site of face and letter sensitivity when conveyed via SSDs, though with distinct temporal dynamics and spatial localizations. In the case of faces versus scrambled faces, differences first manifested at 460ms post-stimulus onset as topographic EEG modulations that were in turn localized to a network of right-hemisphere regions, including the fusiform face area (FFA) as well as lateral occipital cortices. In the case of discerning vertically versus horizontally oriented letter shapes, differences first manifested at 370ms post-stimulus onset as topographic EEG modulations that were localized to a network of left-hemisphere regions, including the occipital pole and the occipito-temporal junction extending into the angular gyrus. Notably, early-latency auditory evoked potentials did not differ based on visual properties of the soundscapes. These collective data support the proposition that responses to soundscapes are routed to brain circuits ordinarily specialized for processing visual information and that these circuits are the loci of the initial discriminant processes. By providing the temporal dynamics of SSD perception, our findings provide unique evidence for the theory that cortices are characterised by task-contingent functional organisation.

**Abstract:**
The nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR) required for cell death (NRC) family represents a group of helper NLRs that are required by sensor NLRs to execute hypersensitive cell death during pathogen infection. NRCs contain an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain essential for their function, yet our knowledge of how this domain contributes to NRC function remains limited. Here, we identified a novel hydrophobic feature within the CC domain that contributes to NRC-mediated immunity. We screened for conserved hydrophobic residues among NRCs and identified seven required for NRC4-mediated cell death. Structural analysis revealed that four of these residues form a hydrophobic core in the CC domain. This hydrophobic core is important for NRC4 subcellular localization, oligomerization, and phospholipid association, but not for NRC4 focal accumulation at the extrahaustorial membrane during Phytophthora infestans infection. Sequence analysis and functional assays revealed this core is highly conserved in NRCs and some singleton NLRs but has degenerated in NRC-dependent sensor NLRs. Our study identifies a novel hydrophobic feature in the CC domain of NRCs and reveals its contribution to NLR-mediated immunity.

**Abstract:**
Macrophages are a highly plastic innate immune cell subset that depends on environmental cues to activate, execute and resolve inflammatory responses. This plasticity of function is mirrored by the diversity of RNA modifications that dynamically decorate macrophage transcripts. Here, using the mouse macrophage line RAW 264.7 (RAW), we addressed the combinatorial effect of two major mRNA modifications: adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) deamination by ADAR1 and adenosine N6-methylation (m6A) by METTL3. Using both short-read and single molecule sequencing on RAW macrophages with genetic deletions of ADAR1 or METTL3, we identified transcripts that were modified by both enzymes, with specific functional outcomes on macrophage activation. While m6A levels remained relatively stable even in the absence of ADAR1, loss of METTL3 led to a global reduction in A-to-I editing levels. This interrelation was most apparent when m6A sites were distant from sites of deamination, suggesting a possible function of m6A in ADAR1-mediated editing. Using a dual reporter cell line where guided ADAR1 recruitment can be measured via eGFP reactivation, we observed that m6A modification of ADAR-engager guide RNAs substantially improved targeted RNA editing. Overall, we report the first example of an interdependence between modifications, which can also be therapeutically exploited.

**Abstract:**
Assessment of pharmacological intervention on in vitro neural systems often emphasizes molecular and structural changes. However, neural systems fundamentally process and act on information. For preclinical assays to predict drug efficacy, they must model these physiological functions. DishBrain, an in vitro synthetic biological intelligence (SBI) assay embodying a neural system in a simulated game-world, enables the quantification of this information-processing capacity, however the question remains whether such a system permits classical pharmacological interrogation and dose-response profiling. Hyperactive glutamatergic dysregulation is linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy, and inducible overexpression of neurogenin 2 (NGN2) in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) generates glutamatergic cultures with dysregulated hyperactivity. We therefore tested three anti-seizure medications (ASMs), phenytoin, perampanel, and carbamazepine, on NGN2 neurons from day 21 of differentiation in this system. The key finding was that, while all compounds altered spontaneous firing, carbamazepine 200 {micro}M significantly improved gameplay metrics. This marks the first demonstration of altered SBI following exogenous drug treatment. Notably, only inhibitory compounds enhanced goal-directed activity, linking glutamatergic attenuation to performance. Neurocomputational analysis revealed nuanced pharmacological responses during closed-loop stimulation, highlighting insights beyond spontaneous activity metrics.

## AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is essential for tendon homeostasis and prevents premature senescence and ectopic calcification

**Abstract:**
Tendinopathy is a debilitating tendon disorder affecting millions of people, characterized by pain, swelling, and diminished biomechanical properties. While the precise mechanisms underlying tendon homeostasis remain unclear, metabolic regulation plays a critical role. In this study, we combine transcriptomic analysis of human tendinopathic samples with a conditional mouse model in which Prkaa1 (encoding AMPK1) is selectively deleted in tendon progenitors to elucidate the role of AMPK signaling in tendon homeostasis. RNA sequencing of diseased human tendons revealed downregulation of key metabolic genes, including several involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and AMPK signaling pathways, alongside an increase in markers associated with senescence and a secretory inflammatory profile. In parallel, mice with loss of Prkaa1 function exhibited normal postnatal development; however, by one month of age, tendons demonstrated widespread transcriptional alterations related to cell cycle regulation and ECM organization. By three months, AMPK1-deficient tendons showed significant reductions in mechanical strength and increased expression of senescence markers p21 and p16, progressing to prominent ectopic calcification with age. In vitro studies further confirmed that tendon fibroblasts lacking AMPK1 have altered ECM substrate adhesion profiles. Importantly, voluntary exercise partially rescued these deficits by enhancing ECM organization and reducing senescence marker expression. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that AMPK1 is critical for maintaining energy balance, regulating ECM remodeling, and preventing premature cellular senescence in tendon. These insights highlight AMPK signaling as a promising therapeutic target and underscore the beneficial role of exercise in mitigating tendinopathic changes.

**Abstract:**
Chronic unhealthy sleeping behaviours are a major risk factor for the emergence of mood and anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, we are still lacking understanding why some individuals are more prone than others to affective dysregulation caused by sleep disruption. With preliminary evidence suggesting that brain activity during positive and negative emotional processing might play an important modulating role, we conducted whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses in a large cohort of healthy young adults (N = 155). Using regions consistently affected in insomnia disorder as seeds, we investigated sleep quality-related neural connectivity patterns that were both insensitive and sensitive to the interactions with individual measures of reward and punishment processing, additionally assessing the links with indices of emotional health. The majority of the findings reflected interactions between sleep quality and reinforcement sensitivity, with the opposite associations reported in the good and poor sleepers. One of such connections, the coupling between precentral gyrus and posterior insula, was additionally negatively linked to trait anxiety, with the lowest connectivity values observed in poor sleepers with higher sensitivity to punishment. In turn, the only finding associated solely with sleep quality, i.e. coupling between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus, was also related to the habitual use of emotion suppression strategies. As such, the present study provides evidence that reinforcement sensitivity plays an essential role in understanding the associations of poor sleep quality with brain connectivity and emotional health, hinting at a potential link that may help explain individual differences in susceptibility to sleep-related affective dysregulation.

**Abstract:**
Somatic structural variations (SVs) are critical genomic alterations in cancer genomes. Long-read sequencing (LRS) is theoretically optimal for detecting somatic SVs. However, influenced by reads-to-reference alignment errors, particularly in low-complexity or highly repetitive genomic intervals, current LRS-based somatic SV callers fail to accurately detect SVs. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive ground-truth datasets hinders accurate evaluation. Here, we introduce SVscope, a novel algorithm that fundamentally addresses these challenges by leveraging full-length sequence information from span-reads and integrating local graph-genome optimization with a random forest strategy. SVscope outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six paired long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) benchmark cell lines, achieving a maximum F1-score improvement of 16.7%. In simulated datasets, SVscope demonstrates superior performance in both somatic SV detection and read phasing tasks. Based on the findings from SVscope, we validated 47 somatic SVs, thereby significantly expanding the existing experimentally validated ground-truth somatic SV dataset by 69.1%.

## Cryo-EM structure of endogenous Plasmodium falciparum Pfs230 and Pfs48/45 fertilization complex

**Abstract:**
Plasmodium falciparum Pfs230 and Pfs48/45, part of a core fertilization complex, are leading malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates. However, how the two proteins interact is unknown. Here we report a 3.36 [A] resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the endogenous Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex. We show that Pfs48/45 interacts with Pfs230 domains 13 and 14, domains that are not included in current Pfs230 vaccine immunogens. Using a transgenic parasite line with a domain 13 to 14 deletion, we show that these domains are essential for Pfs230 localization on the gamete surface. Furthermore, this line significantly reduced oocyst formation in the mosquito midgut, showing that the presence of Pfs230 domains 13 and 14 is critical for successful fertilization. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibit Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation, reduce transmission and structural analyses reveal their binding epitopes. Furthermore, domains 13 and 14 are targets of naturally acquired immunity and when delivered as mRNA-LNP immunizations induce potent immune responses and blocked transmission of malaria parasites. Our comprehensive structural insights on a core P. falciparum fertilization complex will guide the design of novel transmission-blocking vaccine candidates against malaria.

**Abstract:**
The Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) is the most ubiquitous protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane. This channel facilitates the flux of water-soluble metabolites and ions like calcium across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Beyond this canonical role, VDAC has been implicated, through interactions with protein partners, in several cellular processes such as apoptosis, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. There are three VDAC isoforms in mammalian cells, VDAC 1, 2, and 3, with varying tissue-specific expression profiles. From a biophysical standpoint, all three isoforms can conduct metabolites and ions with similar efficiency. However, isoform knockouts (KOs) in mice lead to distinct phenotypes, which may be due to differences in VDAC isoform interactions with partner proteins. To understand the functional role of each VDAC isoform within a single cell type, we created functional KOs of each isoform in HeLa cells and performed a comparative study of their metabolic activity and proteomics. We found that each isoform KO alters the proteome differently, with VDAC3 KO dramatically downregulating key members of the electron transport chain (ETC) while shifting the mitochondria into a glutamine-dependent state. Importantly, this unexpected dependence of mitochondrial function on the VDAC3 isoform is not compensated by the more ubiquitously expressed VDAC1 and VDAC2 isoforms. In contrast, VDAC2 KO did not affect respiration but upregulated ETC components and decreased key enzymes in the glutamine metabolic pathway. VDAC1 KO specifically reduced glycolytic activity linked to decreased hexokinase localization to mitochondria. These results reveal non-redundant roles of VDAC isoforms in cancer cell metabolic adaptability.

**Abstract:**
Calcineurin is a highly conserved phosphatase that plays a central role in sensing calcium and governing transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational signaling networks. Calcineurin is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic A subunit and a regulatory B subunit. Through downstream effectors, calcineurin signaling drives myriad responses in different organisms. In the fungal pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex that infects humans, calcineurin governs thermotolerance and is essential for growth at high temperature and pathogenesis. In Cryptococcus deneoformans, the underlying molecular functions of this critical signaling cascade are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a genetic screen and identified genetic changes that suppress the requirement for calcineurin during high-temperature growth. Our results identified two mechanisms that bypass the requirement for calcineurin function. The first mechanism involves segmental aneuploidy via both amplification as well as loss of chromosome fragments. The second mechanism involves dominant amino acid substitution mutations in the genes encoding three proteins, Chs6, Imp2, and Cts1, orthologs of components of the Ingression Progression Complex required for septation and budding in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Loss of calcineurin activity causes chitin and chitosan accumulation and severe budding defects, whereas suppressor mutations largely restore growth and cytokinesis in the absence of calcineurin. These findings reveal the calcineurin signaling cascade controls a conserved cytokinesis machinery at the mitotic exit network during thermal stress.

**Abstract:**
As we listen to speech, our brains actively compute the meaning of individual words. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we hypothesized that the brain employs vectorial coding principles, such that meaning is reflected in distributed activity of single neurons. We recorded responses of hundreds of neurons in the human hippocampus, which has a well-established role in semantic coding, while participants listened to narrative speech. We find encoding of contextual word meaning in the simultaneous activity of neurons whose individual selectivities span multiple unrelated semantic categories. Like embedding vectors in semantic models, distance between neural population responses correlates with semantic distance; however, this effect was only observed in contextual embedding models (like BERT) and was reversed in non-contextual embedding models (like Word2Vec), suggesting that the semantic distance effect depends critically on contextualization. Moreover, for the subset of highly semantically similar words, even contextual embedders showed an inverse correlation between semantic and neural distances; we attribute this pattern to the noise-mitigating benefits of contrastive coding. Finally, in further support for the critical role of context, we find that range of neural responses covaries with lexical polysemy. Ultimately, these results support the hypothesis that semantic coding in the hippocampus follows vectorial principles.

**Abstract:**
Hyperreflexia is a consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI) and motor system lesions in the brain Two major mechanisms underpinning hyperreflexia have been reported: proprioceptive afferent (PA) circuit changes produced by 1A fiber sprouting, which could enhance reflex signaling, together with reduced GABAergic inhibitory presynaptic regulation (GABApre); and increased intrinsic motor neuron excitability, for example, produced by reduced motor neuron membrane-bound potassium-chloride co-transporter2 (KCC2). Here we examine how selective unilateral CST injury in the medullary pyramid (PTX), which eliminates the CST from one hemisphere, allows for specific investigation of the different mechanisms to determine their contributions to hyperreflexia. We used rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the Hoffmann (H)-reflex for the forelimb and hindlimb 5th-digit abductor muscles to assess hyperreflexia on both the contra-and ipsilesional sides. We compared RDD in naive and unilateral-PTX rats at 7-dpi and 42-dpi, supplemented with additional timepoints to examine hyperreflexia development.

Immunohistochemistry was used to identify PA synapses (VGlut1), GABA presynaptic boutons (GABApre), motor neurons (ChAT), and to measure KCC2. Following unilateral PTX, we observed significant hyperreflexia in the contralesional forelimb only. Membrane-bound KCC2 was unchanged in contralesional cervical motor neurons. Whereas both cervical and lumbar motor neurons showed increased PA sprouting contralesionally, there was a concomitant increase in GABApre terminals for the lumbar not cervical cord, which associated with a normal hindlimb H-reflex. Our findings show that KCC2 is disassociated from hyperreflexia in the uniPTX model. Instead, forelimb hyperreflexia can be explained by cervical motor neuron PA sprouting and an uncompensated GABApre regulation.

**Abstract:**
Fluorescent imaging enables visualization of the specific molecules of interest with high contrast, and the use of multiple fluorophores in a single tissue sample allows visualization of complex relationships between biological molecules, cell types, and anatomy. The utility of fluorescent imaging in human tissue has been limited by endogenous pigments that can block the light path or emit an autofluorescence, thereby interfering with the specific imaging of target molecules. Although photobleachers have been developed to quench endogenous pigments, the lack of customizability limits their utility for a broad range of applications. Here, we present a high luminous-intensity photobleacher that is based on rigorous simulations of illumination patterns using the laws of radiation, along with the framework to maximize bleaching efficiency. This open-source project is designed to help researchers customize and scale according to the tissue types and the research goals. The photobleacher is applicable to both thin tissue slices and large-volume cleared tissue samples to enable serial three-dimensional imaging of postmortem human brain using multiplexed antibody or oligonucleotide probes.

**Abstract:**
We present the first causal evidence in the healthy human brain linking the central thalamus to vigilance and the pulvinar to visuospatial attention using low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS). In a within-subjects, counterbalanced design, 27 healthy volunteers completed the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), a vigilance task, and the Egly-Driver Task (EDT), which assesses visuospatial attention, before and after central thalamus, pulvinar, and sham sonication with tFUS. Central thalamic sonication significantly impaired performance on both tasks in a manner consistent with decreases in arousal. Targeting the pulvinar with tFUS resulted in more subtle changes in visuospatial attention. Participants were less reactive to visual stimuli presented in the visual field contralateral to the affected pulvinar. These results demonstrate that tFUS can elicit measurable behavioral changes in healthy volunteers and underscores its potential as a high-resolution tool for non-invasive brain mapping, capable of differentiating functional contributions of thalamic regions only millimeters apart.

**Abstract:**
Intratumor transcriptional heterogeneity (ITTH) presents a major challenge in cancer treatment, particularly due to limited understanding of the diverse malignant cell populations and their relationship to therapy resistance. While single-cell sequencing has provided valuable insights into tumor composition, its high cost and technical complexity limits its use for large-scale tumor screening. In contrast, several databases collecting bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from multiple samples across various cancer types are available and could be used to profile ITTH. Several deconvolution approaches have been developed to infer cellular composition from such data. However, most of these methods rely on predefined markers or single cell reference datasets, limiting the performance of such methods by the quality of used reference data. Although unsupervised approaches do not face such limitations, existing methods have not been specifically adapted to characterize malignant cell states, and focus instead on general cell types. To address these gaps, we introduce CDState, an unsupervised method for inferring malignant cell subpopulations from bulk RNA-seq data. CDState utilizes a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization model improved with sum-to-one constraints and a cosine similarity-based optimization to deconvolve bulk gene expression into distinct cell state-specific profiles, and estimate the abundance of each state across tumor samples. We validate CDState using bulkified single-cell RNA-seq data from five cancer types, showing that it outperforms existing unsupervised deconvolution methods in both cell state proportions and gene expression estimation. Applying CDState to 33 cancer types from TCGA, we identified recurrent malignant cell programs, with epithelial-mesenchymal transition as the main driver of tumor transcriptional heterogeneity. We further link the identified malignant states to patient clinical features, revealing states associated with worse patient prognosis. We show that ITTH is linked with patient survival and clinical features, as well as is associated with varied responses to therapy. Finally, we identified potential genetic drivers of ITTH and malignant cell states, including TP53, KRAS, and PIK3CA, known oncogenic genes.

**Abstract:**
Deep learning methods have been developed to predict gene expression levels across various cell and tissue types based on DNA-binding sites of protein identified by ChIP-seq. However, the experimental identification of DNA/RNA-binding sites and the functional characterization of certain proteins remain challenging. Here I predicted the regulatory target genes and functional roles of DNA/RNA-binding proteins using gene co-expression data. Gene co-expression correlations are derived from gene expression profiles across cells and tissues and represent interactions between a DNA/RNA-binding protein and other genes. I used these interactions to predict gene expression levels by partially replacing the input data in the deep learning analysis. Functional annotations statistically overrepresented in the predicted target genes of ten DNA/RNA-binding proteins examined in this study were consistent with their known biological roles. Furthermore, several annotations not present in current gene function databases were supported by findings in previously published studies.

**Abstract:**
Tinnitus, the perception of sound without an external source, affects a significant portion of the population, yet its impact on brain communication diagram known as the functional connectome, remains limited. Traditional functional connectivity (FC) methods, such as Pearson correlation, phase lag index and coherence rely on pairwise comparisons and are therefore limited in providing a holistic encoding of FC. Here, we employ an alternative approach to estimate the entire connectivity structure by analyzing all time-courses simultaneously. This approach is robust even for short-duration recordings, facilitating faster functional connectome identification and real-time applications. Using resting-state MEG recordings from controls and individuals with tinnitus, we demonstrated that the learned connectomes outperform correlation-based connectomes in fingerprinting, that is, identifying an individual from test-retest acquisitions. Group-level analysis revealed distinct altered FC in tinnitus across multiple frequency bands, affecting the default mode, auditory, visual, and salience networks, suggesting a reorganization of these large-scale networks beyond auditory areas. Our study reveals that tinnitus presents highly individualized and heterogeneous whole-brain connectome profiles, highlighting the need to focus on individual variability rather than group-level differences to gain a more nuanced understanding of tinnitus. Personalized FC could enable patient-specific tinnitus models, optimizing treatment strategies for individualized care.

**Abstract:**
Influenza continues to pose significant global health threats, hijacking host cellular machinery through protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are fundamental to viral entry, replication, immune evasion, and transmission. Yet, our understanding of these host-virus PPIs remains incomplete due to the vast diversity of viral proteins, their rapid mutation rates, and the limited availability of experimentally validated interaction data. Additionally, existing computational methods often struggle due to the limited availability of high-quality samples and their inability to effectively model the complex nature of host-virus interactions. To address these challenges, we present SEHI-PPI, an end-to-end framework for human-influenza PPI prediction. SEHI-PPI integrates a double-view deep learning architecture that captures both global and local sequence features, coupled with a novel adaptive negative sampling strategy to generate reliable and high-quality negative samples. Our method outperforms multiple benchmarks, including state-of-the-art large language models, achieving a superior performance in sensitivity (0.986) and AUROC (0.987). Notably, in a stringent test involving entirely unseen human and influenza protein families, SEHI-PPI maintains strong performance with an AUROC of 0.837. The model also demonstrates high generalizability across other human-virus PPI datasets, with an average sensitivity of 0.929 and AUROC of 0.928. Furthermore, AlphaFold3-guided case studies reveal that viral proteins predicted to target the same human protein cluster together structurally and functionally, underscoring the biological relevance of our predictions. These discoveries demonstrate the reliability of our SEHI-PPI framework in uncovering biologically meaningful host-virus interactions and potential therapeutic targets.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
Infectious diseases, also known as communicable disease or transmissible disease is illness that is caused due to pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. One of such infection is caused by zoonotic virus (bat-borne) known as Nipah virus (NiV). NiV is one of the worlds deadliest viruses leading to highest mortality rates. It is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to category C priority pathogen that belongs to genus Hepanivirus, and family Paramyxoviridae. The first occurrence of NiV was observed in Malaysia-Singapore during 1998-1999 and the most recent outbreak in Kozhikode district of Kerala in 2018.

Currently, no drugs or vaccines specific to NiV have proven to yield effective outcome at advanced stage of the disease. However, some therapies involving antiviral drug like Ribavirin along with other medicines have shown to recover patients, reducing the death rate by 36%. Due to extensive research various therapeutic strategies have been proven to successfully target the viral infection during the early stages in animal models. Several vaccines have been under investigation and clinical trials serving as a promising approach towards effective and safe vaccine in both livestock animals and humans.

This study underscores the essential contributions shaping the academic discourse in nipah virus research, bringing to light the most influential studies within the co-citation and co-occurrence network analysis. By identifying the keywords, we gain valuable insights into the foundational research driving advancements in this research area. The detailed mapping of the co-citation network further illuminates the interconnectedness of various research themes and the collaborative efforts that boost the field of nipah virus research in different horizons. The recognition of influential studies not only highlights the depth and breadth of scholarly engagement but also provides a roadmap for future research endeavours.

**Abstract:**
The growing interconnection between human, animal, and environmental health has escalated the need for integrated approaches to public health. The One Health framework addresses this necessity by promoting local, national, and global interdisciplinary collaboration. Population growth, intensive animal farming, and manmade environmental changes contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases of probable animal origin, such as COVID-19. Establishing the Quadripartite collaboration with four multilateral United Nations agencies underscores the increasing recognition of these interdependencies. This scoping review protocol aims to evaluate how One Health studies integrate human, animal, and environmental health, analyzing methodologies, scope, and interdisciplinary collaboration, to identify key achievements, existing gaps, and future research priorities. The projected literature search will include PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Virtual Health Library, Health Systems Evidence, and Social Systems Evidence. Additionally, grey literature will be retrieved from Opengrey, Thesis Commons, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations, by structured electronic search, as well as the first 100 entries in Google Scholar, manually. This protocol proposes to include studies, policies, regulations, strategies, and interventions published from 2004 onwards aimed at the prevention and integrated management of food safety, zoonotic diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and the impacts of climate change on health. No language filters will be applied. Two independent reviewers will analyze titles, abstracts, and full texts to conduct a two-phase review, with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. Data will be retrieved using a standardized data extraction form, and results will be presented in graphic and tabular format, accompanied by a narrative summary, to highlight the achievements of integrated One Health implementation. The expected result is the development of a scoping review protocol to map One Health studies and practices, which effectively integrate the human, animal, and environmental health dimensions applicable globally in public health scenarios.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

**Abstract:**
Despite intensive study, gaps remain in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to limited contextual metadata accompanying most large genomic surveillance datasets. We analyzed over 130,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, over 85,000 with matched epidemiological data, collected in Massachusetts from November 2021 to January 2023, to investigate viral transmission dynamics at high resolution. The data were drawn from diagnostic testing at >600 facilities representing schools, workplaces, public testing, and other sectors, and encompass the emergence of six major viral lineages, each representing a new outbreak. We found urban areas as key hubs for new lineage introduction and interurban transmission as facilitating spread throughout the state. Young adults, especially those on college campuses, served as early indicators of emerging lineage dominance. Resident-aged populations in college campuses and nursing homes exhibited a higher likelihood of being linked to within-facility transmission, while staff-aged at those facilities were more linked to their surrounding community. Individuals with recent vaccine doses, including boosters, had a lower likelihood of initiating transmission. This dataset shows the value of linking genomic and epidemiologic data at scale for higher resolution insights into viral dynamics and their implication for public health strategy.

**Abstract:**
IntroductionPneumonia is a leading cause of under-five mortality, with 30 million annual cases in India. Despite national guidelines, significant barriers to timely and appropriate care-seeking persist. Caregivers often face financial constraints, lack of awareness, mistrust in government facilities, and a preference for non-registered medical practitioners (non-RMP), delaying effective treatment. This study explores care-seeking behaviors, associated sociodemographic factors, and barriers to access to appropriate healthcare for childhood pneumonia in rural India.

MethodsThis study is part of a broader implementation research (IR) initiative and represents its formative phase. This mixed-methods study was conducted in Palwal district, Haryana, covering 42 villages (population: 107,440). A cross-sectional survey identified suspected pneumonia cases among 9,593 under-five children through house-to-house visits using a structured checklist. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, health insurance, care-seeking patterns, and provider preferences were collected. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) identified potential confounders in the association between care-seeking behaviour and key exposure variables. Additionally, qualitative in-depth interviews explored caregivers perceptions, decision-making, and healthcare barriers to pneumonia management. Quantitative data were analysed using logistic regression, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed using the Three Delays Model. Suspected under-five pneumonia cases caregivers and families were actively engaged in this formative phase to inform Phase II implementation strategies of broader IR, ensuring community-driven and contextually relevant strategies.

ResultsAmong 231 suspected pneumonia cases, 97% of caregivers sought medical care, but 71% consulted non-RMPs, and only 3.6% visited government facilities. Seeking appropriate care was associated with higher maternal education (AOR 6.5, 95% CI: 2.7, 9.7) and higher wealth index (AOR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.6). Thematic analysis revealed delays due to symptom misinterpretation, reliance on home remedies, financial constraints, gender biases, mistrust in public healthcare services, and logistical barriers.

ConclusionDespite high care-seeking rates, provider preferences, socio-cultural factors, and systemic barriers delay appropriate pneumonia treatment. Addressing these challenges requires improving awareness, enhancing public healthcare trust, and strengthening frontline health worker engagement. This study underscores the role of structured beneficiary involvement in refining pneumonia management strategies to ensure sustainable, community-driven interventions.

**Abstract:**
Psychedelics have garnered great attention in recent years as treatments for major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression due to their ability to alter consciousness and afflicted cognitive processes with lasting effects. Given these unique characteristics and the urgent need for efficacious treatments, psychedelics are being tested for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite promising results and growing interest, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics remain uncharacterized. Using a scoping review approach, we summarize current clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov that utilize classic psychedelics as interventions for SUDs with the goal of understanding the current state and outlook of the field. A second scoping review was conducted using PubMed and SCOPUS databases to identify the relevant publications addressing the pharmacotherapeutic potential of restoring dopamine homeostasis as a novel neurobiological mechanism of psychedelics. This mechanism may blunt drug-seeking behavior, promote drug abstinence, and underlie their clinical relevance for SUD in addition to previously characterized mechanisms.

**Abstract:**
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes significant morbidity, mortality, and growthth faltering among children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. While gut inflammation contributes to growth faltering, the role of ETEC in inflammation remains poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that ETEC-producing heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxins (ST) induced significant inflammation in humans, but LT-only strains are understudied. In this study, we evaluated the intestinal inflammation induced by the LT-only ETEC strain LSN03-016011/A in a human challenge model. Stool samples were analyzed for pre- and post-challenge myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines, ETEC shedding, and ETEC-specific antibody responses. MPO, IL-1{beta}, and IL-8 levels significantly increased post-ETEC challenge, but there was no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Participants protected from severe diarrhea had higher levels of pre-challenge IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-{gamma} compared to those not protected. The MPO and specific cytokine levels were significantly correlated with the seroconversion status to LT and the colonization factor antigen CS17. This study provides evidence that LT-ETEC strain can induce significant intestinal inflammation even in the absence of symptoms, highlighting the need for a vaccine and a better understanding of the impact of ETEC-attributable inflammation on child health in endemic areas.

Author summaryEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of enteric infections, resulting in diarrhea, malnutrition, and other long-term health effects. However, how ETEC - particularly strains that produce only the heat-labile toxin (LT) - can contribute to gut inflammation is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the impact of an LT-ETEC infection on gut inflammation and its relations to ETEC-specific immune responses using samples from participants in a controlled human infection study. We found that LT-ETEC induces a significant level of gut inflammation marker myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1{beta}, when the patients had moderate to severe diarrhea and even when diarrheal symptoms were mild or absent. Gut inflammation level correlated with immune responses to ETEC. These findings suggest that LT-ETEC infection causes significant gut inflammation, which plays a role in immune responses. Our results highlight the need for preventive strategies to reduce the burden of ETEC-related illness, particularly in regions where these infections are common, to prevent broader adverse consequences for gut health and child development.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundThe World Health Organization recommends perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), generally using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to children at high risk of severe P. falciparum malaria. Currently, PMC is given up to age two in perennial transmission settings. However, no recommendation exists for perennial settings with seasonal variation in transmission intensity, recently categorized as  sub-perennial. Tailored chemoprevention strategies are needed to protect children during seasons and ages of highest malaria risk. The seasonal dimension must adequately cover seasonally increased risk periods, alongside interventions that address year-round, lower intensity transmission. We propose a hybrid malaria chemoprevention (HMC) strategy, integrating two delivery components: 1) existing PMC, and 2) additional monthly SP doses during the higher-risk rainy season, ensuring a one-month gap between any two doses.

MethodsUsing a validated individual-based malaria model combined with pharmacological models of drug action (OpenMalaria), we examined the potential public health impact of the proposed HMC (for children 03-24 months), and an age-expanded HMC (referred to as HMC+, for children 03-36 months), under different drug sensitivity, coverage, and prevalence (5-70%) assumptions.

ResultsHMC and HMC+ demonstrated a median (interquartile range) of 2.1 (1.6-2.6), 2.9 (2.2-3.6) times higher efficacy (relative fold increase in burden averted) compared to only PMC against clinical, and 2.0 (0.6-3.4), 3.3 (0.8-5.8) against severe cases, respectively, in children under age three. This led to a median protective efficacy of 31.8% (25.4-38.2%), 44.9% (36.9-52.9%) against clinical, and 16.1% (7.0-25.2%), 26.4% (14.4-38.4%) against severe cases by HMC and HMC+ respectively, across the prevalence, drug sensitivity, and coverage assumptions. We found positive net impact for children under age five years, outweighing a limited potential of delayed malaria across settings.

ConclusionSubstantially increased public health benefits might be achieved by adding seasonally-targeted chemoprevention to current PMC in sub-perennial malaria transmission settings. Effectiveness-implementation studies should generate empirical evidence of public health impact including on the disease burden averted, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the hybrid approach. Such studies should also explore determinants of implementation success including operational feasibility, and acceptability of proposed dosing strategies which will facilitate deployment decisions.

**Abstract:**
Similarities between mental symptoms in Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and those in Post-COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PCVS) have been observed. Based on a representative survey of the population aged 18 to 69 years in Germany (n = 4,628), the epidemiologies of both PCS and PCVS were studied. Mental symptoms of PCS (fatigue/exhaustion/weakness, reduced performance, concentration and memory problems, sleep disorders and depressed mood) were reported by 12.1% and mental symptoms of PCVS were reported by 12.6% of all respondents. Concerning PCS, mental symptoms were reported more often by females compared to males (13.5% versus 10.7%), whereas no gender differences were found for PCVS. With the increasing number of booster vaccinations, mental PCVS decreased from 20.8% with one vaccination to 8.9% with four or more vaccinations. Overall, non-mRNA vaccines did not lead significantly to more mental symptoms than mRNA vaccines (12.9% versus 12.5%) but did differ concerning mental symptom patterns: concentration and memory problems (8.2% versus 3.3%), impaired performance (5.7% versus 4.2%) and sleep disorders (6.6% versus 3.2%) were reported more frequently in non-mRNA vaccines. The reported rate of mental PCVS being 12.6% is clearly higher than the 0.5% recorded by official documentation systems (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI)), suggesting a major underreporting. The data indicate that mental symptoms occurring in both PCS and PCVS are common, making the differential diagnosis between PCS and PCVS, as well as between both PCS and PCVS and independent mental disorders such as depressive disorders, an important but challenging task.

**Abstract:**
Background We aimed to estimate the burden of antibiotic-nonsusceptible non-bacteremic pneumonia and sinusitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in US adults ([&ge;]18 years). Methods We estimated antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococcal sinusitis and non-bacteremic pneumonia incidence as products of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates, serotype distribution, and serotype-specific antimicrobial nonsusceptibility prevalences by antibiotic class and guideline-recommended agents from 2016-2019. We derived pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates from national healthcare utilization surveys and administrative datasets; pneumococcal-attributable attributable percents and serotype distributions from published data; and serotype-specific nonsusceptibility estimates from Active Bacterial Core surveillance data. We evaluated nonsusceptibility for all serotypes and those targeted by 15-, 20- and 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15/20/21). Results An estimated 16.4% (95% confidence interval 12.8-21.4%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 19.0% (14.8-24.9%) of sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes, translating to 243,521 (179,673-333,675) and 1,844,726 (1,070,763-2,904,089) outpatient visits for pneumonia and sinusitis, respectively, and 10,155 (7,542-13,803) pneumonia hospitalizations annually. An estimated 31.2% (26.6-36.3%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 10.5% (9.4-12.0%) of pneumococcal sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]1 outpatient first-line antibiotic agent. Cases attributable to serotypes targeted by PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21 that were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes accounted for 7.4% (4.7-11.1%), 8.5% (5.8-12.1%), and 12.6% (9.2-17.5%) of all non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia cases, and 8.4% (5.3-12.5%), 9.4% (6.2-13.4), and 14.4% (10.4-20.0%) of all pneumococcal sinusitis cases. Conclusions We demonstrated high proportions of antibiotic nonsusceptibility in non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis in US adults. PCVs and antibiotic stewardship may mitigate antibiotic nonsusceptibility in pneumococcal disease.

**Abstract:**
Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a promising non-invasive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), though significant variability exists in patient responses. This quadruple-blind, sham-controlled crossover randomized clinical trial investigated whether clinical improvement was influenced by the spatial selection of stimulation sites or early cardiac rhythm modulations. Seventy-five MDD patients (33 women) were randomized to either personalized stimulation sites, identified via the strongest negative functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the default mode network (DMN), or fixed stimulation at the F3 position of the 10-20 EEG system. Electrocardiograms throughout stimulation monitored heart rate and its variability, focusing on heartbeat deceleration (RR slope) and changes in the root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats (RMSSD). Findings demonstrated that a higher RR slope within the first 45 seconds of stimulation predicted greater clinical improvement at six weeks, while a lower RMSSD change during the first 270 seconds correlated with improvement at one week. However, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between personalized and fixed stimulation sites. This study identified a significant relationship between early heart rhythm modulations and the antidepressant effects of accelerated iTBS in MDD. Although the spatial determination of stimulation sites did not enhance clinical improvement, iTBS-induced changes in cardiac rhythm during early sessions may develop into valuable biomarkers for stratifying patients, enabling more personalized and effective treatment strategies in the future.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: University students frequently experience challenges that affect their sleep quality, including academic stress, lifestyle habits, and socio-demographic factors. Common sleep disturbances, such as delayed sleep onset and poor sleep efficiency, often result in daytime dysfunction and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm. Methods: This cross-sectional study appraised sleep quality among undergraduate students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 530 undergraduate students were purposively selected from three public universities. Participants were chosen through convenience sampling, with students who had contracted COVID-19 during the study excluded from the sample. Results: The mean age of the university students was 21.1 (2.0) years. Regarding PSQI components, the participants showed moderate sleep latency (55.7%) and habitual sleep efficiency (56.0%), with mild levels of sleep disturbances at night (68.1%), daytime dysfunction (51.1%), and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm (48.5%). The global PSQI scores were poor for 59.4% of participants, while 40.6% had good scores, with a mean of 6.5(2.9). Among the students, 44.9% reported fair subjective sleep quality, followed by good (24.7%), very good (18.1%), and poor (12.3%) sleep quality. Lifestyle factors such as class attendance, online media usage, BMI, physical exercise, tea/coffee consumption, and smoking were significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Sleep quality factors like daytime sleep duration, nighttime sleep latency, and sleeping pill usage were also significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Significant associations were found between sleep quality and factors such as age, household income, daily study hours, BMI, daytime sleep, and sleep latency (p<0.05). Conclusion: The study revealed that longer sleep latency, daytime sleep, and sleeping pill usage were related with poorer sleep quality. It also emphasized that sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm were significant predictors of sleep quality.

**Abstract:**
In 2024, the Americas region experienced the largest dengue outbreak on record and Brazil was among the worst affected countries, reporting 6.6 million cases and 6,200 deaths. We report the long-term entomological and epidemiological effectiveness of city-wide deployment of wMel-strain Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti in Niteroi, a city of half a million people in Rio de Janeiro state, where Wolbachia releases across 70% of the urban population in 2017-2019 were expanded to remaining populated areas in 2023. wMel was durably established at [&ge;]95% prevalence in Ae. aegypti populations throughout Niteroi four years post-release, and up to seven years in the earliest release sites. This city-wide Wolbachia coverage provided sustained population-level protection against dengue throughout the five years post-intervention, including during the 2024 epidemic surge, averting an estimated three-quarters of the dengue case burden that would otherwise have been expected in Niteroi in 2024.

**Abstract:**
Background: Patients with rare cancers face substantial challenges due to limited evidence-based treatment options, resulting from sparse clinical trials. Advances in large language models (LLMs) and recommendation algorithms offer new opportunities to utilize all clinical trial information to improve clinical decisions. Methods: We used LLM to systematically extract and standardize more than 100,000 cancer trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Each trial was annotated using a customized scoring system reflecting cancer-treatment interactions based on clinical outcomes and trial attributes. Using this structured data set, we implemented three state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend potentially effective treatments across different cancer types. Results: The LLM-driven data extraction process successfully generated a comprehensive and rigorously curated database from fragmented clinical trial information, covering 78 cancer types and 5,315 distinct interventions. Recommendation models demonstrated high predictive accuracy (cross-validated RMSE: {0.49--0.62}) and identified clinically meaningful new treatments for melanoma, independently validated by oncology experts. Conclusions: Our study establishes a proof of concept demonstrating that the combination of LLMs with sophisticated recommendation algorithms can systematically identify novel and clinically plausible cancer treatments. This integrated approach may accelerate the identification of effective therapies for rare cancers, ultimately improving patient outcomes by generating evidence-based treatment recommendations where traditional data sources remain limited.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: Though dementia is a serious illness that progresses over many years, little is known about the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Objective: To test the impact of a virtual, nurse-led primary palliative care intervention on older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Methods: This randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed to compare the impact of {usual care} to {usual care plus a virtual, nurse-led, primary palliative care intervention} on community- dwelling, chronically ill older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Results: We hypothesize that patients in the virtual nurse intervention arm will have their primary palliative care needs identified and fulfilled compared to those in the usual care arm. Conclusions: Identification of the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of and/or with MCI, mild or moderate dementia will help refine intervention to effectively provide primary palliative care in a timely manner to these patients.

**Abstract:**
Introduction. HIV testing and treatment coverage among men in Zambia remains suboptimal, partly due to lower healthcare-seeking behavior compared to women. To address this gap, Circle of Hope (CoH), a local faith-based organization funded by the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), developed the community post (CP) model. CPs are staffed by multi-disciplinary teams that provide HIV-testing, anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) testing. This analysis assesses the impact of these CPs on HIV case finding, ART initiation, and VL suppression among men. Methods. Routine program data reported to PEPFAR by CoH Zambia were analyzed for two periods: pre-COVID 19 (April 2018-March 2020) and during the pandemic (April 2020-March 2022). Indicators included the number of HIV tests conducted and positive results received (overall and for index testing specifically), ART initiation among men living with HIV (MLHIV), 12-month retention on ART, and the proportion of clients with VL suppression (<1000 copies/mL). Results. Between April 2018 and March 2022, the number of CPs expanded from 9 to 38 across Zambia. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, men continued to represent a substantial share of clients: 49.5% to 41.4% of those tested, 38.5% to 42.0% of those diagnosed (p<0.001), and 38.9% to 43.3% of those initiated on ART (p<0.001). The number of men on ART rose from 3,320 (38%) to 13,580 (43%, p<0.000001). Retention and VL suppression among men also remained high, increasing slightly from 94% to 97% and 95% to 96%, respectively. Over 6,000 men were diagnosed through index testing services, with percent positivity consistently high, ranging from 54.4% to 61.1% (p<0.001). Conclusions. The CoH model was successful at identifying and linking MLHIV to HIV treatment services and assisting them to achieve and maintain viral suppression even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding this community-based model may help close HIV testing and treatment gaps among men and advance HIV epidemic control in Zambia and beyond.

**Abstract:**
Background There is a need for person-centred outcome measures (PCOMs) in tuberculosis (TB) clinical trials to capture the priorities of affected individuals relating to both disease and treatment, alongside the traditional efficacy and safety analysis. Methods We conducted a literature search to identify existing health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) measurement tools and instances where they have been used to evaluate TB disease in interventional studies. DR-TB survivors were recruited for focus group discussions in South Africa, Mongolia and Georgia to determine the most important aspects of disease and treatment experience from their perspective. A second round of focus groups then worked to prioritise these items and group them within different domains. A panel of researchers and academic clinicians evaluated existing PCOMs identified in the literature search using a published framework. Finally, an assessment was carried out by a experienced TB Community Advisory Group members for appropriateness and acceptability, and clinical trial site investigators for feasibility of the PCOMs. Results The initial round of 9 focus groups involving 57 participants identified priority items grouped under the fields overall quality of life, disease symptoms, and treatment and side effects. In the second round of four focus groups involving 26 participants, the highest ranked items under overall quality of life were duration of treatment, experience of swallowing pills, and how long before being able to contribute to the household. The most important symptoms were coughing, weight loss and breathlessness. The highest ranked side effects were nausea/vomiting, skin colour changes, and nerve problems. FACIT-TB was the only measurement tool assessed that was rated good for appropriateness, and excellent, good or fair in all other fields by community representatives, researchers and clinical trial site staff. Conclusions The FACIT-TB measurement tool was identified as the most appropriate disease-specific PCOM currently available for use in clinical trials investigating novel DR-TB therapeutics.

**Abstract:**
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) 2024 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment guidelines expand eligibility for nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment in individuals with chronic HBV infection. For countries to implement these guidelines, there is a critical need to understand the population who are treatment eligible. While HBV drug resistance (HBVDR) is uncommon, monitoring for any potential resistance is a relevant public health consideration. Methods: We studied a population in rural Uganda to describe the proportion of individuals eligible for treatment based on the 2024 WHO treatment guidelines. We determined how this proportion varies according to the eligibility criteria used, comparing the performance of different assessment tools. We calculated Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet Ratio Index; APRI, Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase-to-Platelet Ratio; GPR and transient elastography; TE and performed HBV sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology to determine the prevalence of HBVDR in treatment naive and treatment experienced individuals. Results: In this cohort, 24/63 (38%) individuals with CHB were eligible for treatment. This fell to 14/63 (22%) in a hypothetical scenario where TE was not available for the assessment of liver fibrosis. We demonstrate a lack of concordance between non-invasive tests (NIT) of liver disease in treatment-naive HBV mono-infected individuals. An APRI cut-off of 0.5 had a sensitivity of 23.0% for predicting a TE score of >7 kPa (F2 fibrosis). Sensitivity for detecting F2 fibrosis was increased to 38.5% using an APRI cut off of 0.36, and to 46.2% using the GPR. We did not identify any HBVDR in the HBV mono-infected treatment-naive population (n=58). 24/210 individuals were living with HIV/HBV coinfection; HBV was sequenced in 5 of these of whom 2 had genomic evidence of nucleos(t)ide analogue resistance (rt180M/204V). Conclusions: While the WHO 2024 treatment criteria offer an opportunity to expand access to care, there is a need to determine how assessment tools differ in determination of eligibility in different settings. HBVDR remains uncommon but more research is needed to understand its prevalence and clinical impact in African populations.

## Solving General QUBOs with Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

## Crosstalk between Proline Hydroxylation and Histidine Methylation Regulates Actin-Dependent Cell Mobility Control

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

## NetSyn: genomic context exploration of protein families

**Abstract:**
Background: The growing availability of large genomic datasets presents an opportunity to discover new metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions useful for industrial or synthetic biological applications. Efforts to identify new enzyme functions in this huge number of sequences cannot be achieved without the help of bioinformatics tools and the development of new strategies. Standard methods for assigning a biological function to a gene are based on sequence similarity. However, another way is to mine databases to identify conserved gene clusters (i.e. syntenies). Indeed in prokaryotic genomes, genes involved in the same pathway are frequently encoded in a single locus with an operonic organisation. This Genomic Context (GC) conservation is considered as a reliable indicator of functional relationships, and thus is a promising approach to improve the gene function prediction. Methods. Here we present NetSyn (Network Synteny), a tool which aims to cluster protein sequences according to the similarity of their genomic context rather than their sequence similarity. Starting from a set of protein sequences of interest, NetSyn retrieves neighbouring genes from the corresponding genomes as well as their protein sequences. Homologous protein families are then computed to measure GC conservation between each pair of input sequences using a GC conservation score. A network is created where nodes represent the input proteins and edges the fact that two proteins share a common GC. The weight of the edges corresponds to the synteny conservation score. The network is then partitioned into clusters of proteins sharing a high degree of synteny conservation. Results. As a proof of concept, we used NetSyn on two different datasets. The first one is made of homologous sequences of an enzyme family (the BKACE family, previously named DUF849) to divide it into sub-families of specific activities. NetSyn was able to go a step further by providing additional subfamilies to those already published. The second dataset corresponds to a set of non-homologous proteins consisting of different Glycosyl Hydrolases (GH) with the aim of interconnecting them and finding conserved operon-like genomic structures. NetSyn was able to find a locus composed of 3 non homologous glycosyl hydrolases, involved in the degradation of xyloglucan, in 162 genomes. Discussion. NetSyn is able to cluster proteins according to their genomic context, making it possible to establish functional links between proteins without considering their sequence similarity alone. We showed that NetSyn is efficient in exploring large protein families to define iso-functional groups. It can also highlight functional interactions between proteins from different families and predicts new conserved genomic structures that have not yet been experimentally characterised. NetSyn can also be useful for pinpointing annotation errors that have been propagated across databases, and for suggesting annotations on proteins currently annotated as "unknown". NetSyn is freely available at https://github.com/labgem/netsyn.

**Abstract:**
The locus coeruleus (LC), the major source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is among the earliest site of pathology in both Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD), and it undergoes catastrophic degeneration later in both disorders. Dysregulation of the LC is thought to contribute to prodromal symptoms of AD and PD such as anxiety and sleep disturbances, while frank LC loss promotes cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms responsible for its selective vulnerability are unknown. It has been suggested that neuromelanin (NM) pigment contributes to LC susceptibility, but causal relationships have been difficult to test because rodents do not naturally produce NM. Here, we report that viral-mediated expression of human tyrosinase induced pigmentation in mouse LC neurons that recapitulated key features of natural primate NM. One week of NM accumulation resulted in LC neuron hyperactivity, reduced tissue NE levels, transcriptional changes, and anxiety-like behavior. By 6-10 weeks, NM accumulation was associated with severe LC neuron neurodegeneration and microglial engulfment of the pigment granules, while the anxiety-like behavior abated. These phenotypes are reminiscent of LC dysfunction and cell death in AD and PD, validating this model for studying the consequences of NM accumulation in the LC as it relates to neurodegenerative disease.

Significance StatementAlzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) are two of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Because therapies that cure or even prevent their progression are lacking, research is focused on the identifying earliest signs of disease as targets for diagnosis and treatment. The locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of the neurotransmitter n norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is one of the first brain regions affected in both AD and PD. LC dysregulation promotes prodromal AD and PD symptoms, while its degeneration accelerates disease progression. Here we identify neuromelanin (NM) pigment as a LC vulnerability factor that induces neuronal hyperactivity followed by cell death. Approaches that mitigate NM accumulation and toxicity may target the earliest phases of neurodegenerative disease.

**Abstract:**
Brain pericytes maintain the blood-brain barrier (BBB), secrete neurotrophic factors and clear toxic proteins. Their loss in neurological disorders leads to BBB breakdown, neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Therefore, cell therapy to replace lost pericytes holds potential to restore impaired cerebrovascular and brain functions. However, the molecular composition and function of human iPSC-derived brain pericytes (iPSC-PC) remains poorly characterized. Here, we show by a quantitative analysis of 8,344 proteins and 20,572 phosphopeptides that iPSC-PC share 96% of total proteins and 98% of protein phosphorylation sites with primary human brain pericytes. This includes cell adhesion and tight junction proteins, transcription factors, and different protein kinase families of the human kinome. In pericyte-deficient mice, iPSC-PC home to host brain capillaries to form hybrid human-mouse microvessels with ligand-receptor associations. They repair BBB leaks and protect against neuron loss, which we show requires PDGRFB and pleiotrophin. They also clear Alzheimer's amyloid-beta; and tau neurotoxins via lipoprotein receptor. Thus, iPSC-PC may have potential as a replacement therapy for pericyte-deficient neurological disorders.

**Abstract:**
Disease phenotypes can be described as the consequence of interactions among molecular processes that are altered beyond resilience. Here, we address the challenge of assessing the possible alteration of intra- and inter-cellular molecular interactions among gene sets, which are intended to represent processes and or cellular phenotypes. We present an approach, designated as "Ulisse", which complements the existing methods of enrichment analysis and cell-cell communication analysis. It can be applied to a gene list as well as multiple ranked gene lists, typically derived in the context of omics or multi-omics studies. The approach highlights the presence of alterations in those components that control the interactions between processes or cells. Crosstalk quantification is supported by two null models. Further, the approach provides an additional way of identifying the genes associated with the phenotype. As a proof-of-concept, we applied Ulisse to study the alteration of pathway crosstalks and cell-cell communications in triple negative breast cancer samples, based on single-cell RNA sequencing. In conclusion, our work supports the usefulness of crosstalk analysis as an additional instrument in the "toolkit" of biomedical research for translating complex biological data into actionable insights.

## Resting-state alpha and mu rhythms change shape across development but lack diagnostic sensitivity for ADHD and autism

**Abstract:**
In the human brain, the alpha rhythm in occipital cortex and the mu rhythm in sensorimotor cortex are among the most prominent rhythms, with both rhythms functionally implicated in gating modality-specific information. Separation of these rhythms is non-trivial due to the spatial mixing of these oscillations in sensor space. Using a computationally efficient processing pipeline requiring no manual data cleaning, we isolated alpha and/or mu rhythms from electroencephalography recordings performed on 1605 children aged 5-18. Using the extracted time series for each rhythm, we characterized the waveform shape on a cycle-by-cycle basis and examined whether and how the waveform shape differs across development. We demonstrate that alpha and mu rhythms both exhibit nonsinusoidal waveform shape that changes significantly across development, in addition to the known large changes in oscillatory frequency. This dataset also provided an opportunity to assess oscillatory measures for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found no differences in the resting-state features of these alpha-band rhythms for either ADHD or ASD in comparison to typically developing participants in this dataset. While waveform shape is ignored by traditional Fourier spectral analyses, these nonsinusoidal properties may be informative for building more constrained generative models for different types of alpha-band rhythms, yielding more specific insight into their generation.

**Abstract:**
Perceptual decision-making is the process by which an animal uses sensory stimuli to choose an action or mental proposition. This process is thought to be mediated by neurons organized as attractor networks1,2. However, whether attractor dynamics underlie decision behavior and the complex neuronal responses remains unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings from hundreds of neurons, together with an unsupervised, deep learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in frontal cortex and striatum of rats while the subjects accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes, the first dominated by sensory inputs, and the second dominated by the autonomous dynamics, with flow in a direction (i.e., "neural mode") largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that the transition to the second regime corresponds to the moment of decision commitment. We developed a simplified model that approximates the coupled transition in dynamics and neural mode and allows precise inference, from each trials large-scale neural population activity, of a putative neurally-inferred time of commitment ("nTc") on that trial. The simplified model captures diverse and complex single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping3-5, as well as trial-averaged curved trajectories6-8, and reveals distinctions between brain regions. The estimated nTc times were not time-locked to stimulus onset or offset, or to response onset, but were instead broadly distributed across trials. If nTc marks the moment of decision commitment, sensory evidence before nTc should affect the decision, while evidence afterward should not. Behavioral analysis of trials aligned to their estimated nTc times confirmed this prediction. Our results show that the formation of a perceptual choice involves a rapid, coordinated transition in both the dynamical regime and the neural mode of the decision process that corresponds to commitment to a decision, and suggest this moment as a useful entry point for dissecting mechanisms underlying rapid changes in internal state.

**Abstract:**
Microbes exhibit precise control over their composition and geometry in order to adapt and grow in diverse environments. However, the mechanisms that orchestrate this simultaneous regulation, and how they are causally linked, remains poorly understood. In this work, we derive and experimentally test a biophysical model of cell size regulation in Escherichia coli which relates the cellular surface-to-volume ratio to the total macromolecular composition and partitioning of the proteome between cellular compartments. Central to this model is the observation that the macromolecular density of the cytoplasm and the protein density within the cell membranes are maintained at a constant ratio across growth conditions. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, single-cell microscopy, and biochemical assays, we show this model quantitatively predicts a non-linear relationship between the surface-to-volume ratio, proteome localization, and the total ribosome content of the cell. This model holds under perturbations of intracellular ppGpp concentrations-thereby changing the ribosomal content-demonstrating that cellular geometry is not strictly determined by the cellular growth rate. These findings provide a biophysical link between the coregulation of proteome organization and cellular geometry, offering a quantitative framework for understanding bacterial size regulation across conditions.

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a mathematical model for the growth of transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) inclusion bodies in neuron soma. The parameter representing accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers is also introduced. The models equations allow for the numerical calculation of the concentrations of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, as well as free TDP-43 oligomers and those deposited into inclusion bodies. By simulating the deposition of free oligomers into inclusion bodies, the model predicts the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies. An approximate solution to the model equations is derived for the scenario where protein degradation machinery is dysfunctional, leading to infinite half-lives for TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and both free and deposited oligomers. This solution, valid for large times, predicts that the inclusion body radius increases proportionately to the cube root of time, while accumulated neurotoxicity increases linearly with time. To the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to model the relationship between the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies and time, as well as the first to introduce the concept of accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers. The sensitivity analysis of the approximate solution indicates that the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity are independent of the kinetic constants at large timescales. While the numerical solution of the full mathematical model continues to work with finite half-lives, the approximate solution becomes invalid for scenarios with physiologically relevant (finite) half-lives of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and free misfolded oligomers. In contrast to the scenario with infinite half-lives, the numerical solution reveals that for different values of the kinetic constants, the curves representing the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity converge to distinct curves as time progresses.

**Abstract:**
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is typically treated empirically with vancomycin, with therapy later tailored based on susceptibility results. However, these tests occur before vancomycin exposure and do not account for adaptation during empiric treatment that can alter S. aureus susceptibility to first-line drugs. To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU, impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes. Our findings suggest a probabilistic approach to antimicrobial therapy, advocating for rapid genomic diagnostics alongside susceptibility testing to better anticipate and respond to evolutionary changes.

SignificanceAntibiotic treatment can influence bacterial evolution, altering the effectiveness of subsequent therapies by inducing collateral resistance or sensitivity. This study reveals that evolution toward vancomycin-intermediate resistance in the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus proceeds through at least two distinct evolutionary pathways: one characterized by alterations in cell wall metabolism and another by changes in global stress response. These adaptive trajectories result in contrasting collateral sensitivities to first-line antibiotics. By introducing the Collateral Response Score, we assess the uncertainty in these outcomes, providing a probabilistic framework to evaluate how past antibiotic exposure shapes future treatment responses. Further validation studies are needed; however, we believe that improved forecasting of pathogen evolution can enhance antibiotic stewardship, inform therapeutic decisions, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

**Abstract:**
Recent studies have established a reciprocal causal link between aging and the activation of transposable elements, characterized in particular by a de-repression of LINE-1 retrotransposons. These LINE-1 elements represent 21% of the human genome, but only a minority of these sequences retain the coding potential essential for their mobility. LINE-1 encoded proteins can induce cell toxicity implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, our knowledge of the expression and localization of LINE-1-encoded proteins in the central nervous system is limited. Using a novel approach combining atlas-based brain mapping with deep-learning algorithms on large-scale pyramidal brain images, we unveil a heterogeneous, neuron-predominant and widespread ORF1p expression throughout the murine brain at steady-state. In aged mice, ORF1p expression increases significantly which is corroborated in human post-mortem dopaminergic neurons by an increase in young LINE-1 elements including those with open reading frames. Mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous mouse ORF1p revealed novel, neuron-specific protein interactors. These findings contribute to a comprehensive description of the dynamics of LINE-1 and ORF1p expression in the brain at steady-state and in aging and provide insights on ORF1p protein interactions in the brain.

**Abstract:**
Proteobacterial methanotrophs are dependent on the oxidation of methane for ATP production and assimilation of carbon into biomass. Interestingly, some types of gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs thrive in oxygen-depleted zones of lakes and other aquatic ecosystems despite their reliance on oxygen to support methane oxidation. The model gammaproteobacterial methanotroph, Methylomonas denitrificans FJG1, oxidizes methane coupled to nitrate reduction under hypoxia and highly upregulates its expression of bacteriohemerythrin (Bhr). Bhr is a homolog of eukaryotic hemerythrin, which is a protein associated with oxygen binding. Ten bhr homologs were identified in the genome of M. denitrificans FJG1, requiring phylogenetic and gene expression analyses to pinpoint which homolog is likely responsible for delivering oxygen to support methane oxidation to under low oxygen conditions. This study examined the prevalence and phylogeny of the 10 bhr homologs from M. denitrificans FJG1 in the genomes of other methanotrophs and across the Bacteria. The homolog denoted "bhr-00" was specific to methanotroph genomes, was highly expressed in M. denitrificans FJG1 under hypoxia, and its predicted structure was nearly identical to a purified oxygen-scavenging hemerythrin protein from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath. Other bhr homologs upregulated from denitrifying cultures of M. denitrificans FJG1 included those with gene neighborhoods related to oxygen sensing, denitrification and chemotaxis. Together, this study uncovered potential multifunctional roles of bacteriohemerythrin genes of M. denitrificans FJG1 under low oxygen conditions and identified the bhr homolog that most likely enables and supports oxygen delivery to methane monooxygenase enzymes in anoxic ecosystems.

**Abstract:**
Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker[-&gt;]Brainstem[-&gt;]Thalamus[-&gt;]Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking activity upon multi-whisker stimulation, resembling the stable response pattern observed in barrels. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions.

**Abstract:**
The Global Pandemic Lineage (GPL) of the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been described as a main driver of amphibian extinctions on nearly every continent. Near complete genome of three Bd-GPL strains have enabled studies of the pathogen but the genomic features that set Bd-GPL apart from other Bd lineages is not well understood due to a lack of high-quality genome assemblies and annotations from other lineages. We used long-read DNA sequencing to assemble high-quality genomes of three Bd-BRAZIL isolates and one non-pathogen outgroup species Polyrhizophydium stewartii (Ps) strain JEL0888, and compared these to genomes of previously sequenced Bd-GPL strains. The Bd-BRAZIL assemblies range in size between 22.0 and 26.1 Mb and encode 8495-8620 protein-coding genes for each strain. Our pan-genome analysis provided insight into shared and lineage-specific gene content. The core genome of Bd consists of 6278 conserved gene families, with 202 Bd-BRAZIL and 172 Bd-GPL specific gene families. We discovered gene copy number variation in pathogenicity gene families between Bd-BRAZIL and Bd-GPL strains though none were consistently expanded in Bd-GPL or Bd-BRAZIL strains. Comparison within the Batrachochytrium genus and two closely related non-pathogenic saprophytic chytrids identified variation in sequence and protein domain counts. We further test these new Bd-BRAZIL genomes to assess their utility as reference genomes for transcriptome alignment and analysis. Our analysis examines the genomic variation between strains in Bd-BRAZIL and Bd-GPL and offers insights into the application of these genomes as reference genomes for future studies.

**Abstract:**
Deep learning-based compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction models are promising in the field of molecular biology, particularly for facilitating the drug discovery process. In practical applications, CPI models should achieve a high generalization performance, quantify prediction confidence, and ensure explainability. Here, we propose ChemGLaM, a chemical genomics language model for reliable and explainable CPI predictions, by addressing these three crucial aspects. ChemGLaM integrates independently pre-trained chemical and protein language models through an interaction block with a cross-attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in predicting novel CPIs. Incorporating uncertainty estimation and attention visualization enables ChemGLaM to enhance the success rate of virtual screening and to provide molecular insights into CPIs. Furthermore, we demonstrate its practical applicability by constructing a public database for large-scale CPI predictions and enabling drug/target exploration for candidate treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ChemGLaM represents a significant step toward overcoming the challenges of AI-driven drug discovery and addressing unmet medical needs.

**Abstract:**
In rodents, estrogens aromatized from androgens in the brain are essential for the development of male-typical behaviors. In many other vertebrates including humans and teleost fish, however, androgens facilitate these behaviors directly via the androgen receptor without aromatization into estrogens. Here we report that mutagenesis-derived male medaka fish lacking Cyp19a1b (a subtype of aromatase predominantly expressed in the brain) exhibit severely impaired male-typical mating and aggression, despite elevated brain androgen levels. These phenotypes can be rescued by estrogen administration, indicating that brain-derived estrogens are pivotal for male-typical behaviors even in teleosts. Our results further suggest that these estrogens facilitate male-typical behaviors by potentiating androgen action in the brain via the direct stimulation of androgen receptor transcription, thereby revealing a previously unappreciated mode of action of brain-derived estrogens. We additionally show that female fish lacking Cyp19a1b are less receptive to male courtship and conversely court other females, highlighting the significance of brain-derived estrogens in establishing sex-typical behaviors in both sexes.

**Abstract:**
The spatial arrangement of microtubules in the cytoskeleton in the cells of protists has been used for decades for taxonomy and phylogenetic inference at various levels. In contrast, the protein composition of non-microtubular structures is mostly unknown. Exceptions are system I fibers in algae, which are built of striated fiber assemblins (SFAs). Interestingly, SFAs are also components of a range of other, dissimilar structures, playing a role in the cortex of ciliates, cell division in apicomplexans, and adhesion of the parasite Giardia to the intestine. In a broad bioinformatic survey, we show the existence of three ancestral eukaryotic paralogues of SFA, and note that they are present in all "typical excavates:" small heterotrophic flagellates bearing a ventral feeding groove. In one representative, Paratrimastix pyriformis, we detected two SFA paralogs using specific antibodies and expansion microscopy. We show that they co-localize selectively with several microtubules and structures attached to the basal body of the posterior flagellum, namely the right microtubular root, B-fiber, C-fiber, and composite fiber. We demonstrate that one of the paralogs self-assembles in vitro into striated filaments which, under negative staining and cryo-electron microscopy, resemble system I fibers as seen in previous studies. Given the facts that all three SFA paralogs appear to be ancestral to most eukaryotic lineages, as is probably the morphology of "typical excavates" with a ventral groove, we speculate that a role in the development or function of the feeding apparatus of the common ancestor of most if not all eukaryotes was the primary function of these proteins.

**Abstract:**
Understanding how the eyes, head, and hands coordinate in natural contexts is a critical challenge in visuomotor coordination research, often constrained by sedentary tasks, cued actions, or restricted settings. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment where participants could self-generate pick-and-place actions on a life-size shelf in a virtual environment, recording concurrent gaze and body movements. Subjects exhibited intricate translation and rotation movements of the eyes, head, and hands during the task. We employed a time-dependent principal component analysis to study the relationship between the movements of the eyes, head, and hands relative to the onset of the action. We reduced the overall dimensionality into 2D representations, capturing up to 65% of the movement variance just in time with the actions. Our analysis revealed a synergistic coupling of the eye-head and eye-hand systems, as well as a strong coupling within the head-hand system. The eyes synchronized with the head and hands close to the action onset, with variations in coupling observed in horizontal and vertical planes, indicating distinct mechanisms for coordination in the brain. Crucially, the head and hands remained tightly coupled throughout the observation period, suggesting a shared neural code driving these effectors. Notably, the low-dimensional representations of the eye-head-hand movement vectors showed maximum predictive accuracy of the actions location ~200ms before the action onset, highlighting just-in-time coordination among the three effectors. Furthermore, the predictive accuracy was significantly influenced by the location of the upcoming action. Our study emphasizes the differential visuomotor control subject to the task structure, providing insights into the dynamic interplay of eye, head, and hand movements during natural behavior.

NEW & NOTEWORTHYStudying natural, self-initiated, complex visuomotor coordination, we observe low-dimensional dynamics with distinct patterns along horizontal and vertical axes. The eyes horizontal movement showed notable independence, aligning with head and hand movements just in time for action. Notably, around critical events, the dimensionality of the complex movements is further reduced, indicating dynamic correspondence of eye-head-hand coordination.

**Abstract:**
Stimulation of specific cell groups under different network regimes (e.g., spontaneous activity or sensory-evoked activity) can provide insights into the neural dynamics of cortical columns. While these protocols are challenging to perform experimentally, modelling can serve as a powerful tool for such explorations. Using detailed electrophysiological and anatomical data from mouse V1, we built a novel spiking network model of a cortical column, which incorporates pyramidal cells and three distinct interneuron types (PV, SST, and VIP cells, specified per lamina), as well as the dynamic and voltage-dependent properties of AMPA, GABA, and NMDA receptors. We first demonstrate that thalamocortical feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) stimuli arriving in the column have opposite effects, leading to net columnar excitation and inhibition respectively and revealing translaminar gain control via full-column inhibition by layer 6. We then perturb one cell group (i.e. a cell type in a specific layer) at a time and observe the effects on other cell groups under distinct network states: spontaneous, feedforward-driven, feedback-driven, and a combination of feedforward and feedback. Our findings reveal that when a given group is perturbed, the columnar response varies significantly based on its state, with strong sensory feedforward input decreasing columnar sensitivity to all perturbations and feedback input serving as modulator of intra columnar interactions. Given that activity changes within specific neuronal populations are difficult to predict a priori in experiments, our model may constitute a useful tool to predict outcomes of perturbations and assist in experimental design.

Author SummaryIn this study, we explored how stimulating specific groups of neurons under different conditions (spontaneous or stimulus-evoked states) can help us understand the dynamics of visual cortical columns in mouse cortex. We developed a data-constrained model of a cortical column that includes several cell types (excitatory neurons as well as multiple inhibitory neuron types) and synaptic receptors. Our findings reveal that signals coming from higher brain areas (feedback input) and sensory input (feedforward input) have different impacts on the column: sensory inputs generally increase activity within the column, while feedback tends to decrease it. We then considered input targeting one cell type at a time to see how it affects the internal dynamics. Our results show that neural responses to selected input vary depending on whether the cortical column is in a resting state or being stimulated by feedforward input or feedback input. This model is a useful tool for predicting the outcomes of these cell interactions, which can help in planning real-world experiments and understanding how our brain processes information.

## Synaptic proteome diversity is shaped by the levels of glutamate receptors and their regulatory proteins

**Abstract:**
Synapses formed by equivalent pairs of pre- and postsynaptic neurons have similar electrophysiological characteristics, belonging to the same type. However, these are generally confined to microscopic brain regions, precluding their proteomic analysis. This fact has greatly limited our ability to investigate the molecular basis of synaptic physiology. We introduce a procedure to characterise the synaptic proteome of microscopic brain regions and explore the molecular diversity among the synapses forming the trisynaptic circuit in the hippocampus. While we observe a remarkable proteomic diversity among these synapses, we also report that proteins involved in the regulation of the function of glutamate receptors are differentially expressed in all of them. Moreover, neuron-specific gene expression programs would contribute to their regulation. Here, we introduce a combined proteomics and transcriptomics analysis uncovering a previously unrecognised neuron-specific control of synaptic proteome diversity, directed towards the regulation of glutamate receptors and their regulatory proteins.

**Abstract:**
Single-cell multiomic techniques have sparked immense interest in developing a comprehensive multi-modal map of diverse neuronal cell types and their brain wide projections. However, investigating the spatial organization, transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of brain wide projection neurons is hampered by the lack of efficient and easily adoptable tools. Here we introduce Projection-TAGs, a retrograde AAV platform that allows multiplex tagging of projection neurons using RNA barcodes. By using Projection-TAGs, we performed multiplex projection tracing of the mouse cortex and high-throughput single-cell profiling of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of the cortical projection neurons. Projection-TAGs can be leveraged to obtain a snapshot of activity-dependent recruitment of distinct projection neurons and their molecular features in the context of a specific stimulus. Given its flexibility, usability, and compatibility, we envision that Projection-TAGs can be readily applied to build a comprehensive multi-modal map of brain neuronal cell types and their projections.

**Abstract:**
The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural dynamics to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviors and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep-learning behavioral analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an unpleasant, affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective-motivational behaviors without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic mu-opioid receptor promoter to drive chemogenetic inhibition. This opioid-mimetic gene therapy recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain, thereby offering a new strategy for precision pain management targeting a key nociceptive cortical opioid circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

**Abstract:**
The events that lead to protein misfolding diseases are not fully understood. Many proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., TDP43) interact with nucleic acids, including RNA G-quadruplexes. In this work, we investigate whether RNA G-quadruplexes play a role in TDP43 condensation in biophysical and cellular models. We find that G-quadruplexes modulate TDP43 aggregation in vitro and condensation in multiple cell types, including yeast, HEK293T, and motor-neuron-like NSC-34 cells. In yeast cells, treatment with G-quadruplexes causes increased TDP43 accumulation in cells before cellular death. In HEK293T cells expressing TDP43, incubation with G-quadruplex-binding small molecules causes an increase in G4 stability that also stabilizes TDP43 and reduces TDP43 condensation induced by proteasomal or oxidative stress. Finally, in NSC-34 cells overexpressing exogenous TDP43, we show that G-quadruplexes co-localize with TDP43 condensates under stress conditions and treatment with G-quadruplex-binding small molecules decreases TDP43-mediated toxicity. Together, these findings suggest that a novel future approach to explore for treating protein misfolding diseases may be to target specific RNA structures such as G-quadruplexes.

**Abstract:**
Archaeal tubulin-like cytoskeletal protein CetZ1 is required for rod-cell morphogenesis during the development of motile cells in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. It has been unknown whether CetZ1 or its paralogs contribute to motility solely through the effects of rod cell shape on swimming speed, or in other ways too. Here, we found that CetZ1 also plays significant roles in the polar assembly of the motility machinery including the archaellum base protein ArlD1, the chemotaxis sensory array adapter CheW1, and signal transducer CheY. Notably, overexpression of cetZ1 or cetZ2 differentially influenced motility and the polar assembly of the motility machinery, but caused no detectable change in the rod shape of motile cells. CetZ1 localized at the poles of motile cells, but its imperfect co-localization with the motility machineries suggests it may promote their assembly indirectly, such as via a role in organisation or structure of the cell poles.

**Abstract:**
Ion channels are necessary for proper water and nutrient absorption in the intestine, thereby supporting cellular metabolism and organismal growth. While a role for Na+ co-transporters and pumps in intestinal nutrient absorption is well defined, how individual K+ uniporters function in this process is poorly understood. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that a gain-of-function mutation in twk-26, which encodes a two-pore domain K+ ion channel orthologous to human KCNK3, facilitates nutrient absorption and suppresses the metabolic and developmental defects caused by loss of DRL-1/FLR-4 signaling. Mutations in drl-1 and flr-4, which encode two unique kinases that are components of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the downstream flr-1 Na+ ion channel, cause severe growth defects, reduced lipid storage, and a dramatic increase in autophagic lysosomes, which mirror dietary restriction phenotypes. We reveal that this dietary restriction phenotype is likely the result of impaired intestinal amino acid absorption, which is restored upon activation of TWK-26. Furthermore, we show that loss of flr-4 disrupts intracellular and extracellular pH gradients, suggesting that the FLR-4 pathway may be necessary to maintain intestinal ion homeostasis and facilitate nutrient absorption. The altered pH gradients in the flr-4 mutant are partially restored by activation of TWK-26, demonstrating a novel role for this K+ ion channel in governing intestinal physiology and metabolism.

**Abstract:**
In the canonical interpretation of dopaminergic neuron activity during Pavlovian conditioning, initially cell firing is triggered by unexpected rewards. Upon learning, activation instead follows the reward-predictive conditioned stimulus, and when expected rewards are withheld, firing is inhibited. However, little is known about dopaminergic neuron activity during the actual learning process in complex operant tasks. Here, we recorded optogenetically identified dopaminergic neurons of ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice training in multiple, successive operant sensory discrimination tasks. A delay between nose-poke choices and trial outcome signals (for reward or punishment) probed for predictive activity. During training, but prior to criterion performance, firing rates signaled correct versus incorrect choices, but prior to outcome signals. Thus, the neurons predicted whether choices would be rewarded, despite the animals' subthreshold behavioral performance. Surprisingly, these neurons also fired after reward delivery, as if the rewards had been unexpected according to the canonical view, but activity was inhibited after punishment signals, as if the reward had been expected after all. These inconsistencies suggest revision of theoretical formulations of dopaminergic neuronal activity to embody multiple roles in temporal difference learning and actor-critic models. Furthermore, on training trials when these neurons predicted that a given choice was correct and would be rewarded, surprisingly, the mice adhered to other non-rewarded and untrained task strategies (e.g., spatial alternation). The DA neurons' reward prediction activity could serve as critic signals for the choices just made. This consistent with the notion that the brain must reconcile multiple Bayesian belief representations during learning.

**Abstract:**
Target of Rapamycin (TOR) complexes and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are crucial signaling hubs that coordinate adaptive responses to environmental inputs. While GPCR-mediated regulation of TOR has been extensively studied, little is known about TOR-mediated regulation of GPCRs. Here, we establish TOR as a regulator of GPCR signaling via its control of receptor endocytosis in the yeast mating system. By pairing fluorescence microscopy with yeast genetic approaches, we identify the machinery that bridges TOR nutrient sensing to GPCR internalization. Furthermore, we find that autophagic machinery is employed during mating to deliver active receptor to the vacuole (lysosome), suppressing the mating pathway. These results demonstrate that TOR regulates the localization and signaling of the yeast mating GPCR in both ligand-dependent and -independent contexts. These pathways are highly conserved, suggesting that TOR-regulation of GPCRs may be a broadly conserved mechanism for integrating competing signals involving metabolic state and external communications.

**Abstract:**
The language of biology, encoded in DNA, RNA, and proteins, forms the foundation of life but remains challenging to decode due to its complexity. Traditional computational methods often struggle to integrate information across these molecules, limiting a comprehensive understanding of biological systems. Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with pre-trained models offer new possibilities for interpreting biological language. Here, we introduce LucaOne, a pre-trained foundation model trained on nucleic acid and protein sequences from 169,861 species. Through large-scale data integration and semi-supervised learning, LucaOne demonstrates an understanding of key biological principles, such as DNA-Protein translation. Using few-shot learning, it effectively comprehends the central dogma of molecular biology and performs competitively on tasks involving DNA, RNA, or protein inputs. Our results highlight the potential of unified foundation models to address complex biological questions, providing an adaptable framework for bioinformatics research and enhancing the interpretation of life's complexity.

**Abstract:**
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer that is unresponsive to hormonal therapies. One potential TNBC-specific therapeutic target is NQO1, as it is highly expressed in many TNBC patients and lowly expressed in non-cancer tissues. Here we use a derivative of DNQ, isobutyl-deoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ) that is more potent and specific in killing TNBC cells than NQO1-activator {beta}-lapachone while displaying strong NQO1-dependence. We evaluated the cellular signaling changes that occur following 4-hour treatment of TNBC cells with either single agent or combination IB-DNQ and / or PARP inhibitor (Rucaparib). Short treatments (4 hours) with IB-DNQ alone or combined with the PARP inhibitor Rucaparib revealed few changes in protein abundance but significant rapid alterations in protein phosphorylation and thermal stability, with clear synergy in the combination treatment. Key phosphorylated targets linked to RNA Polymerase II inhibition and DNA damage response were altered during our short time treatment. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) identified novel, combination-specific changes in protein biophysical state suggesting new therapeutic vulnerabilities in TNBC cells. Our findings highlight how even brief treatments can uncover distinct biophysical protein changes via TPP, offering a resource for mechanistic studies of IB-DNQ mechanism of action and the development of NQO1-activated therapeutics for TNBC treatment.

**Abstract:**
Accumulation of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the hippocampus triggers cognitive memory decline in Alzheimers disease (AD). The incidence and mortality of sporadic AD were tightly associated with diabetes and hyperlipidemia, while the exact linked molecular is uncertain. Here, we reported that serum Kallistatin concentrations were meaningfully higher in AD patients, with a higher concentration of fasting blood glucose and triglyceride. In addition, the constructed Kallistatin-transgenic (KAL-TG) mice defined its cognitive memory impairment phenotype and lower LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons accompanied by increased A{beta} deposition and tau phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Kallistatin could directly bind to the Notch1 receptor and thereby upregulate BACE1 expression by inhibiting PPAR{gamma} signaling, resulting in A{beta} cleavage and production. Besides, Kallistatin could promote the phosphorylation of tau by activating GSK-3{beta}. Fenofibrate, a hypolipidemic drug, could alleviate cognitive memory impairment by down-regulating A{beta} and tau phosphorylation of KAL-TG mice. Collectively, our data clarified a novel mechanism for A{beta} accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation regulation by Kallistatin, which might play a crucial role in linking metabolic syndromes and cognitive memory deterioration, and suggested that fenofibrate might have the potential for treating metabolism-related AD. Key words: Alzheimers disease, Kallistatin, A{beta}42, BACE1, Diabetes

**Abstract:**
Spatial biology experiments integrate the molecular and histological landscape of tissues to provide a previously inaccessible view of tissue biology, unlocking the architecture of complex multicellular tissues. Within spatial biology, spatial transcriptomics platforms are among the most advanced, allowing researchers to characterize the expression of thousands of genes across space. These new technologies are transforming our understanding of how cells are organized in space and communicate with each other to determine emergent phenotypes. This is particularly important in cancer research, as tumor evolution is shaped not only by the genetic properties of cancer cells but also by how they interact with the tumor microenvironment and their spatial organization. While many platforms can generate spatial transcriptomics profiles, it is still unclear in which context each platform better suits the needs of its users. Here we compare the results obtained using 5 different spatial transcriptomics (VISIUM, VISIUM CytAssist, VisiumHD, Xenium, and CosMx) and one spatial proteomics (VISIUM CytAssist) platforms across serial sections of 6 FFPE samples from primary human tumors covering some of the most common forms of the disease (lung, breast, colorectal, bladder, lymphoma and ovary). We observed that the VISIUM platform with CytAssist chemistry yielded superior data quality than manual VISIUM. On the other hand, Xenium consistently produced more reliable results for in situ platforms, with better gene clustering and fewer false positives than CosMx. Importantly, these platform-based variations didn't significantly affect cell type identification. VisiumHD offers the best options of both worlds, with subcellular resolution and whole-transcriptome coverage, albeit with some limitations that need to be accounted for in downstream analyses. Finally, by comparing VISIUM protein profiles with the spatial transcriptomics data from all four platforms on each sample, we identified several genes with mismatched RNA and protein expression patterns, highlighting the importance of multi-omics profiling to reveal the true biology of human tumors.

## Surface Wetting Is a Key Determinant of α-Synuclein Condensate Maturation

**Abstract:**
-Synuclein self-assembles into amyloid fibrils during neurodegeneration. The protein can also self-assemble via liquid-liquid phase separation to form biomolecular condensates. The link between these processes is evident, as -synuclein condensates can mature into amyloids. However, the mechanisms driving this maturation remain largely unknown, particularly when incorporating pathological post-translational modifications known to affect -synuclein self-assembly in the absence of LLPS, such as N-terminal truncation. Moreover, condensates are primarily studied as isolated entities; however, it is increasingly evident that they interact with various cellular components and surfaces. Here, we developed a microscopy-based quantitative real-time imaging protocol to investigate how N-terminal truncation influences -synuclein condensate formation, well surface wetting, and maturation. We found that increasing -synuclein truncation, which reduces N-terminal hydrophobicity, inhibits condensate sedimentation, enhances surface wettability, and accelerates maturation. Additionally, by increasing well surface hydrophobicity we decreased -synuclein condensate wettability, delaying their maturation. Thus, we propose that enhanced wettability, which increases the condensate surface-to-volume ratio, promotes -synuclein nucleation at the condensate-bulk solution interface, thereby accelerating maturation. Our results reveal distinct mechanistic roles for -synuclein N-terminal residues and indicate that condensate wetting on cellular surfaces, such as synaptic vesicles, may drive toxic aggregate formation during neurodegeneration.

**Abstract:**
Spatial transcriptomics technologies aim to localize gene expression in tissues and typically use capture surfaces that have undergone spatial indexing or optical decoding to relate surface sequences to spatial positions. Slide-tags is a recently developed method by Russell et al. that inverts this principle, instead diffusing probes from a pre-decoded bead array into tissues, tagging nuclei with spatial bead barcodes. We reanalyzed this data and discovered a latent, spatially informative cell-bead network formed incidentally as a result of barcode diffusion and the biophysical properties of the tissue. By optimizing proximity constraints encoded in the cell-bead network structure, we could infer cell locations without any spatial indexing, placing Slide-tags among a new generation of optics-free, network-based imaging-by-sequencing approaches, a fundamental departure from classical spatial sequencing technologies based on pre-indexed arrays.

**Abstract:**
Animals must balance the urgent need to find food during starvation with the critical necessity to avoid toxic substances to ensure their survival. In Drosophila, specialized Gustatory Receptors (GRs) expressed in Gustatory Receptor Neurons (GRNs) are critical for distinguishing between nutritious and potentially toxic food. GRNs project their axons from taste organs to the Subesophageal Zone (SEZ) in the Central Brain (CB) of Drosophila, where gustatory information is processed. Although the roles of GRs and GRNs are well-documented, the processing of gustatory information in the SEZ remains unclear. To better understand gustatory sensory processing and feeding decision-making, we molecularly characterized the first layer of gustatory interneurons, referred to as Gustatory Second-Order Neurons (G2Ns), which receive direct input from GRNs. Using trans-synaptic tracing with trans-Tango, cell sorting, and bulk RNAseq under fed and starved conditions, we discovered that G2Ns vary based on gustatory input and that their molecular profile changes with the fly's metabolic state. Further data analysis has revealed that a pair of neurons in the SEZ, expressing the neuropeptide Leucokinin (SELK neurons), receive simultaneous input from GRNs sensing bitter (potentially toxic) and sweet (nutritious) information. Additionally, these neurons also receive inputs regarding the starvation levels of the fly. These results highlight a novel mechanism of feeding regulation and metabolic integration.

## Longitudinal trajectories of brain development from infancy to school age and their relationship to literacy development

**Abstract:**
Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures support long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and childrens home literacy environments, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to first-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop by birth but undergo further refinement between infancy and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.

Significance StatementReading is crucial for academic, vocational, and health outcomes, but acquiring proficient reading skills is a protracted developmental process involving lower-level subskills and brain structures that undergo rapid development starting in infancy. We examined how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development support long-term acquisition of reading using a reproducible pipeline we developed specifically for infant-to-school-age longitudinal MRI data. Findings suggest that the brain bases of reading-related skills begin to develop by birth but continue building between infancy and preschool. This study emphasizes the importance of considering academic skill acquisition as a dynamic process preceding the emergence of the skill, and it offers a roadmap for future studies to examine relationships between early brain development and academic skill acquisition.

## Cell division protein A (CdpA) organises and anchors the division ring at midcell in haloarchaea

**Abstract:**
Many archaea appear to divide through the coordinated activities of two FtsZ homologues (FtsZ1 and FtsZ2) and another bacterial cell division homologue (SepF), which are part of the midcell division ring. Here, we identify an additional protein (HVO_0739, renamed CdpA) that is involved in cell division in Haloferax volcanii, with homologues in other Haloarchaea. CdpA localizes at the mid-cell division ring, and this requires the presence of the ring-assembly protein FtsZ1. The division constriction protein FtsZ2 also influenced the proper midcell assembly and structure of CdpA. In the absence of CdpA, cells frequently failed to divide properly, and FtsZ1 formed poorly condensed pseudo-helical structures spanning across a broad region of the cell, whereas FtsZ2 showed mispositioned foci, nano-rings, and filaments. The rate of directional movement of FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 structures around the division ring appeared minimally affected by loss of CdpA, which resulted in continual repositioning of the aberrant FtsZ structures in the cells. In contrast to the FtsZ proteins, CdpA formed relatively immobile foci around the ring. Protein domain function studies, pull-down assays, and multimer structure predictions suggest that CdpA is part of a membrane complex that tethers FtsZ2 and other division proteins to the midcell membrane. Our discovery of an archaeal FtsZ organisation and midcell anchor protein offers new insights into cell division mechanisms that are similar across the tree of life.

## Ternary Neurexin-T178-PTPR complexes represent a presynaptic core-module of neuronal synapse organization

**Abstract:**
The organization of cell-cell contacts is fundamental for multi-cellular life and operation of organs. Synapses, prototypic contact sites for neuronal communication, are key to brain function and work over the last decades identified multiple synaptic cell adhesion molecules (sCAMs) that drive their organization. Whether these sCAMs operate independently or in coordination through yet unknown linker proteins remained elusive. Here, we used a systematic large-scale multi-epitope affinity-purification approach combined with quantitative mass spectrometry and immuno-EM to comprehensively map trans-synaptic protein networks in the mouse brain. We discover a presynaptic core-module assembled from the two major sCAM families, Neurexins1-3 and LAR-type receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRD,S,F), and the previously uncharacterized tetraspanin proteins T178A, B. These ternary Neurexin-T178-PTPR complexes form through their transmembrane domains and assemble during biogenesis in the ER. Loss of T178B results in module dissociation, strong reduction of LAR-PTPRs and redistribution of synaptic Neurexins. At synapses, the Neurexin-T178-PTPR module recruits stable and extended trans-synaptic protein networks with defined pre- and post-synaptic partners and secreted extracellular linkers. The network architecture robustly interlinks the distinct functional modules/machineries of the presynaptic active zone and establishes tight associations with XKR-type lipid scramblases and postsynaptic GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors. Our data identify a universal presynaptic core-module for synaptic adhesion and trans-synaptic signaling in the mammalian brain.

**Abstract:**
Cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography provide crucial experimental data for obtaining atomic-detail models of biomacromolecules. Refining these models relies on library-based stereochemical restraints, which, in addition to being limited to known chemical entities, do not include meaningful noncovalent interactions relying solely on nonbonded repulsions. Quantum mechanical (QM) calculations could alleviate these issues but are too expensive for large molecules. We present a novel AI-enabled Quantum Refinement (AQuaRef) based on AIMNet2 neural network potential mimicking QM at substantially lower computational costs. By refining 41 cryo-EM and 30 X-ray structures, we show that this approach yields atomic models with superior geometric quality compared to standard techniques, while maintaining an equal or better fit to experimental data. Notably, AQuaRef aids in determining proton positions, as illustrated in the challenging case of short hydrogen bonds in the parkinsonism-associated human protein DJ-1 and its bacterial homolog YajL.

**Abstract:**
Background: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane-bound receptors that transmit critical signals from extracellular to intracellular spaces. Transcriptomic data of resected breast tumors show that low mRNA expression of orphan GPCR GPR52 correlates with reduced overall survival in patients with breast cancer, leading to the hypothesis that loss of GPR52 supports breast cancer progression. Methods: CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knockout GPR52 in the human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, and in the non-cancerous breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. 2D and 3D in vitro studies, electron microscopy, Matrigel culture, and a zebrafish xenograft model were used to assess the morphology and behavior of GPR52 KO cells. RNA-sequencing and proteomic analyses were also conducted on these cell lines, and transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to compare GPR52-null and wild-type (WT) signatures in breast cancer. Results: Loss of GPR52 was found to be associated with increased cell-cell interaction in 2D cultures, altered 3D spheroid morphology, and increased propensity to organize and invade collectively in Matrigel. Furthermore, GPR52 loss was associated with features of EMT in MDA-MB-468 cells, and zebrafish injected with GPR52 KO cells developed a greater total cancer area than those injected with control cells. RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses of GPR52-null breast cancer cells revealed an increased cAMP signaling signature. Consistently, we found that treatment of wild-type (WT) cells with forskolin, which stimulates the production of cAMP, induces phenotypic changes associated with GPR52 loss, and inhibition of cAMP production rescued some GPR52 KO phenotypes. Conclusion: GPR52 is an orphan GPCR and its role in cancer progression has not been previously characterized. We found that GPR52 loss in breast cancer cells can lead to increased cell clustering, collective invasion, and EMT in vitro. These are features of increased cancer aggression. Our results reveal that GPR52 loss is a potential mechanism by which breast cancer progression may occur and support the investigation of GPR52 agonism as a therapeutic option for breast cancer.

**Abstract:**
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) occur primarily in the small intestine, lung and pancreas. Due to their rarity compared to other malignancies in these organs, their complex biology remains poorly understood, including their oncogenesis, tumor composition and the intriguing phenomena of mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN). Here we profiled ten low-grade small intestine NET (SiNET) tumor samples as well as one mixed lung tumor by single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq. We find that SiNETs are largely separated into two distinct subtypes, in which the neuroendocrine cells upregulate epithelial or neuronal markers, respectively. Surprisingly, in both subtypes the neuroendocrine cells are largely non-proliferative while higher proliferation is observed in multiple non-malignant cell types. Specifically, B and plasma cells are highly proliferative in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype, potentially reflecting the outcome of high Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) expression in those tumors, which may constitute a relevant target. Finally, our analysis of a mixed lung neuroendocrine tumor identifies a population of putative progenitor cells that may give rise to both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (squamous) cells, potentially explaining the origin of the mixed histology. Taken together, our results provide important insights and hypotheses regarding the biology of neuroendocrine neoplasms.

**Abstract:**
Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced our understanding of meaning representation in the human brain. However, increasingly large LLMs have been questioned as valid cognitive models due to their extensive training data and their ability to access context hundreds of words long. In this study, we investigated whether instruction tuning, another core technique in recent LLMs beyond mere scaling, can enhance models' ability to capture linguistic information in the human brain. We evaluated the self-attention of base and fine-tuned LLMs of different sizes against human eye movement and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity patterns during naturalistic reading. We show that scaling has a greater impact than instruction tuning on model-brain alignment, reinforcing the scaling law in brain encoding performance. These finding have significant implications for understanding the cognitive plausibility of LLMs and their role in studying naturalistic language comprehension.

This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological and dynamic single cell features. BEHAV3D-TP integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers without advanced computational expertise to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.

**Abstract:**
Sound encoding depends on the precise and reliable neurotransmission at the afferent synapses between the sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation, as well as interplay between the pre- and postsynaptic components remain largely unclear. Here, we tested the role of the synaptic adhesion molecule and Nogo/RTN4 receptor homolog RTN4RL2 (also referred to as NgR2) in the development and function of afferent IHC-SGN synapses. Upon deletion of RTN4RL2 in mice (RTN4RL2-/-), presynaptic IHC active zones showed enlarged synaptic ribbons and a depolarized shift in the activation of CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels. The postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of SGNs were smaller and deficient of GluA2-4 despite maintained Gria2 mRNA expression in SGNs. Next to synaptically engaged PSDs we observed &#x0022orphan&#x0022 PSDs located away from IHCs. They likely belong to a subset of SGN peripheral neurites that do not contact the IHCs in RTN4RL2-/- cochleae as found by volume electron microscopy reconstruction of SGN neurites. Auditory brainstem responses of RTN4RL2-/- mice showed increased sound thresholds indicating impaired hearing. Together, these findings suggest that RTN4RL2 contributes to the proper formation and function of auditory afferent synapses and is critical for normal hearing.

**Abstract:**
Yeast Def1 promotes transcription elongation and RNA polymerase II degradation during genotoxic stress. Def1 is cytoplasmic, and DNA damage signals cause its proteolytic processing, liberating its N-terminus to enter the nucleus. Cytoplasmic functions for this abundant protein have not been identified. Proximity-labeling (BioID) experiments indicate that Def1 binds many proteins involved in posttranscriptional control and translation of mRNAs. Deleting DEF1 reduces both mRNA synthesis and decay rates and directly tethering Def1 to a reporter mRNA suppressed expression, suggesting that Def1 directly regulates mRNAs post-transcriptionally. Surprisingly, we found that Def1 interacts with polyribosomes, which requires its N-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain and ubiquitylation of eS7a (Rsp7A) in the small subunit of the ribosome by the Not4 protein in the Ccr4-Not complex. Ribo-seq analysis revealed that deleting DEF1 affected the translation efficiency of a specific subset of transcripts, a genome-wide shift in ribosome footprints on mRNAs and an increase in the dwelling of ribosomes at non-optimal codons. This, together with the high sensitivity of def1{Delta} to translation inhibitors further suggest impaired translation. The polyglutamine-rich unstructured C-terminus of Def1 is required for its interaction with decay and translation factors, suggesting that Def1 acts as a ubiquitin-dependent scaffold to link translation status to mRNA decay. Thus, we have identified a novel function for this transcription and DNA damage response factor in post-transcriptional regulation in the cytoplasm and establish Def1 as a master regulator of gene expression, functioning from transcription to translation.

**Abstract:**
SomaScan and Olink are affinity-based platforms that aim to estimate the relative abundance of thousands of human proteins with a broad range of endogenous concentrations. In this study, we investigated the effects of in vitro hemolysis and repeated freeze-thaw cycles in protein abundance quantification across 10,776 (11K SomaScan) and 1472 (Olink Explore 1536) analytes, respectively. Using SomaScan, we found two distinct groups, each one consisting of 4% of all aptamers, affected by either hemolysis or freeze-thaw cycles. Using Olink, we found 6% of analytes affected by freeze-thaw cycles and nearly half of all measured probes significantly impacted by hemolysis. Moreover, we observed that Olink probes affected by hemolysis target proteins with a larger number of annotated protein-protein interactions. We found that Olink probes affected by hemolysis were significantly associated with the erythrocyte proteome, whereas SomaScan probes were not. Given the extent of the observed nuisance effects, we propose that unbiased, quantitative methods of evaluating hemolysis, such as the hemolysis index successfully implemented in many clinical laboratories, should be adopted in proteomics studies. We provide detailed results for each SomaScan and Olink probe in the form of extensive Supplementary Data files to be used as resources for the growing user communities of both platforms.

**Abstract:**
Social cognition develops through a complex interplay between neural maturation and environmental factors, yet the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Using a naturalistic fMRI paradigm, we investigated the effects of age and parental caregiving on social brain development and Theory of Mind (ToM) in 34 mother-child dyads. The functional maturity of social brain networks was positively associated with age, while mother-child neural synchronization during movie viewing was related to dyadic relationship quality. Crucially, parenting and child factors interactively shaped social cognition outcomes, mediated by ToM abilities. Our findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay of neurocognitive development and interpersonal synchrony in early childhood social cognition, and provide novel evidence for Bandura's theory of social learning and reciprocal determinism. This integrative approach, bridging brain, behavior, and parenting environment, advances our understanding of the complex mechanisms shaping social cognition. The insights gained can inform personalized interventions promoting social competence, emphasizing the critical importance of nurturing parental relationships in facilitating healthy social development.

**Abstract:**
The emerging electron microscopy connectome datasets provides connectivity maps of the brains at single cell resolution, enabling us to estimate various network statistics, such as connectedness. We desire the ability to assess how the functional complexity of these networks depends on these network statistics. To this end, we developed an analysis pipeline and a statistic, XORness, which quantifies the functional complexity of these networks with varying network statistics. We illustrate that actual connectomes have high XORness, as do generated connectomes with the same network statistics, suggesting a normative role for functional complexity in guiding the evolution of connectomes, and providing clues to guide the development of artificial neural networks.

## Bioinformatic discovery of type 11 secretion system (T11SS) cargo across the Proteobacteria

**Abstract:**
Type 11 secretion systems (T11SS) are broadly distributed among proteobacteria, with more than 3,000 T11SS family outer membrane proteins (OMPs) comprising 10 major sequence similarity network (SSN) clusters. Of these, only 7, all from animal-associated cluster 1, have been experimentally verified as secretins of cargo, including adhesins, hemophores, and metal binding proteins. To identify novel cargo of a more diverse set of T11SS, we identified gene families co-occurring in gene neighborhoods with either cluster 1 or marine microbe-associated cluster 3 T11SS OMP genes. We developed bioinformatic controls to ensure perceived co-occurrences are specific to T11SS, and not general to OMPs. We found that both cluster 1 and cluster 3 T11SS OMPs frequently co-occur with single carbon metabolism and nucleotide synthesis pathways, but that only cluster 1 T11SS OMPs had significant co-occurrence with metal and heme pathways, as well as with mobile genetic islands, potentially indicating diversified function of this cluster. Cluster 1 T11SS co-occurrences included 2,556 predicted cargo proteins, unified by the presence of a C-terminal {beta}-barrel domain, which fall into 141 predicted UniRef50 clusters and approximately 10 different architectures: 4 similar to known cargo and 6 uncharacterized types. We experimentally demonstrate T11SS-dependent secretion of an uncharacterized cargo type with homology to Plasmin sensitive protein (Pls). Unexpectedly, genes encoding marine cluster 3 T11SS OMPs only rarely co-occurred with the C-terminal {beta}-barrel domain and instead frequently co-occurred with DUF1194-containing genes. Overall, our results show that with sufficiently large-scale and controlled genomic data, T11SS-dependent cargo proteins can be accurately predicted.

**Abstract:**
Kinetochores link chromosomes to dynamic microtubules of the mitotic spindle. To ensure equal chromosome segregation, sister chromatids must achieve biorientation. The conserved kinase Aurora B phosphorylates outer kinetochore proteins on attachments lacking tension, allowing re-establishment of new connections until biorientation is achieved. Aurora B localizes to the centromere as part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), but the underlying recruitment pathways can be eliminated without disrupting biorientation. It therefore remains unclear how the kinase operates during error correction. Here, we identify the conserved Spc105/Kre28 complex as an outer kinetochore receptor of the Aurora kinase Ipl1 and its activator Sli15 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that mutations in the helix bundle domain of Spc105/Kre28 impair mitotic error correction, resembling the effects of ipl1 or sli15 mutants. The defects can be suppressed by artificial recruitment of Ipl1. In biochemical experiments Ipl1/Sli15 directly associates with Spc105/Kre28, and a conserved segment in the Sli15 central domain is crucially involved in the binding mechanism. These results have important implications for the mechanism of tension-dependent error correction during chromosome biorientation.

**Abstract:**
Functional MRI (fMRI) using the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal provides valuable insight into grey matter activity. However, uncertainty surrounds the white matter BOLD signal. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) offers an alternative fMRI contrast sensitive to transient cellular deformations during neural activity, facilitating detection of both grey and white matter activity. Further, through minimising vascular contamination, ADC-fMRI has the potential to overcome the limited temporal specificity of the BOLD signal. However, the use of linear diffusion encoding introduces sensitivity to fibre directionality, while averaging over multiple directions comes at great cost to temporal resolution. In this study, we used spherical b-tensor encoding to impart diffusion sensitisation in all directions per shot, providing an ADC-fMRI contrast capable of detecting activity independently of fibre directionality. We provide evidence from two task-based experiments on a clinical scanner that isotropic ADC-fMRI is more temporally specific than BOLD-fMRI, and offers more balanced mapping of grey and white matter activity. We further demonstrate that isotropic ADC-fMRI detects white matter activity independently of fibre direction, while linear ADC-fMRI preferentially detects activity in voxels containing fibres perpendicular to the diffusion encoding direction. Thus, isotropic ADC-fMRI opens avenues for investigation into whole-brain grey and white matter functional connectivity.

**Abstract:**
Kinesin motor proteins facilitate microtubule-based transport by converting chemical energy into mechanic forces, but this activity is autoinhibited until cargo is loaded. Regulatory mechanisms underlying this autoinhibitory conformation are not well understood. Here, we show that a NEver in mitosis Kinase NEKL-3 directly phosphorylates a flexible elbow region between two coiled coil domains connecting the motor head and tail of an intraflagellar transport kinesin, OSM-3. The phosphor dead (PD) mutation, but not phosphor mimic (PM) mutation, induce constitutive motility of OSM-3 in vitro. Using knock-in animals, we discovered that both PD and PM mutations shorten the C. elegans sensory cilia. The constitutively active OSM-3PD fails to enter cilia and abnormally accumulates in neurites, mimicking another hyperactive mutation, OSM-3G444E. Conversely, OSM-3PM enters cilia but moves at a reduced speed, indicating an inhibitory role of elbow phosphorylation in kinesin motility. These findings highlight the crucial role of elbow phosphorylation in regulating kinesin autoinhibition.

**Abstract:**
The Flower protein was suggested to couple the fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) to their recycling in different model organisms. It is supposed to trigger activity-dependent bulk endocytosis by conducting Ca2+ at endocytic sites. However, this mode of action is debated. Here, we investigated the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog FLWR-1 in neurotransmission. Our results confirm that FLWR-1 facilitates the recycling of SVs at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Ultrastructural analysis of synaptic boutons after hyperstimulation revealed an accumulation of large endocytic structures in flwr1 mutants. These findings do not support a role of FLWR-1 in the formation of bulk endosomes but rather a function in their breakdown. Unexpectedly, loss of FLWR-1 led to increased neuronal Ca2+ levels in axon terminals during stimulation, particularly in GABAergic motor neurons, causing excitation-inhibition imbalance. We found that this increased NMJ transmission might be caused by deregulation of MCA-3, the nematode orthologue of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA). In vivo molecular interactions indicated that FLWR-1 may be a positive regulator of the PMCA and might influence its recycling through modification of plasma membrane levels of PI(4,5)P2.

**Abstract:**
Membrane pore-forming proteins (PFPs) form ring-shaped membrane-translocating oligomers on membranes, contributing to infection, immunity, and cell death functions. Binary toxins produced by some bacteria consist of an enzymatic component that acts as a toxin and a membrane-binding component that forms a pore that delivers the enzymatic component into target cells. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has advanced our understanding of these translocation mechanisms by revealing several binary toxin complexes structures. However, the mechanisms underlying the initial pore formation remain unclear. We determined the structures of several oligomeric forms of the membrane-binding component, Ib, of the Iota toxin from Clostridium perfringens at various stages of pore formation. Structural comparisons revealed that the symmetrically arranged soluble oligomer (prepore) became a transmembrane oligomer (pore). These findings enhance our understanding of the PFP mechanisms and provide a structural basis for developing nanodevices using membrane pores.

**Abstract:**
Biological processes are fundamentally dynamic, yet existing methods for capturing these temporal changes are limited. We present scDynaBar, a novel approach that integrates CRISPR-Cas9 dynamic barcoding with single-cell sequencing to enable the recording of temporal cellular events. In this system, genetic barcodes accumulate mutations over a 25-day period and then are sequenced together with the transcriptome of each single cell. We propose that this gradual accumulation of genetic diversity can be exploited to create an ordered record of a cellular event. We apply this approach to track the transition from a pluripotent state to a two-cell (2C)-like state in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The results provide compelling evidence for the transient nature of the 2C-like state. Additionally, our system shows consistent mutation rates across diverse cell types in a mouse gastruloid model, underscoring its robustness and versatility across various biological contexts. This technique not only improves our ability to study single-cell dynamics but also creates new opportunities for recording other temporal signals, in other words, using dynamic barcoding as a molecular clock in individual cells.

**Abstract:**
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that represent the largest and most therapeutically targeted receptor class, accounting for 30% of currently marketed drugs. Two binding motifs for membrane cholesterol, the cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) domain and the cholesterol consensus motif (CCM), have been postulated. Using a simulation of the molecular dynamics of cholesterol association with the receptor, we predicted the binding of membrane cholesterol to non-canonical sites, distinct from CRAC and CCM, at muscarinic and opioid receptors. We identified a binding site common to muscarinic and opioid receptors at TM6, with arginine 6.35 as the major residue. Membrane cholesterol depletion mimics the effects of R6.35 mutations, confirming its role in receptor modulation. Targeting cholesterol-binding sites offers novel pharmacotherapeutic strategies, including tissue-specific sterol-based modulation.

**Abstract:**
Systemic inflammation can lead to neuroinflammation with acute consequences such as delirium and long-lasting deleterious effects including cognitive decline and the exacerbation of neurodegenerative disease progression. Here we show that transcription factor Nrf2 controls brain endothelial cell homeostasis and barrier strength. We found that peripheral inflammation caused infiltration of macrophages, microglial activation and inflammatory reactive astrogliosis, all of which could be prevented by RTA-404, an activator of the transcription factor Nrf2 and close structural relative of the recently FDA-approved Nrf2 activator RTA-408 (Omaveloxolone). To identify the key cellular mediator(s), we generated an endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 knockout mouse. Strikingly, the effects of RTA-404 on brain endothelial activation and downstream neuroinflammatory events was abolished by endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 deletion. This places endothelial cell Nrf2 as a peripherally accessible therapeutic target to reduce the CNS-adverse consequences of systemic inflammation.

**Abstract:**
As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge capable of evading neutralizing antibodies, it has become increasingly important to fully understand the breadth and functional profile of T cell responses to determine their impact on the immune surveillance of variant strains. Here, sampling healthy individuals, we profiled the kinetics and polyfunctionality of T cell immunity elicited by mRNA vaccination. Modeling of anti-spike T cell responses against ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that epitope immunodominance and cross-reactivity are major predictive determinants of T cell immunity. To identify immunodominant epitopes across the viral proteome, we generated a comprehensive map of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes within non-spike proteins that induced polyfunctional T cell responses in convalescent patients. We found that immunodominant epitopes mainly resided within regions that were minimally disrupted by mutations in emerging variants. Conservation analysis across historical human coronaviruses combined with in silico alanine scanning mutagenesis of non-spike proteins underscored the functional importance of mutationally-constrained immunodominant regions. Collectively, these findings identify immunodominant T cell epitopes across the mutationally-constrained SARS-CoV-2 proteome, potentially providing immune surveillance against emerging variants, and inform the design of next-generation vaccines targeting antigens throughout SARS-CoV-2 proteome for broader and more durable protection.

**Abstract:**
Plasma membrane rupture and the release of cytosolic contents are hallmarks of necrotic cell death. The plasma membrane protein ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) actively promotes cell lysis by polymerizing into membrane embedded filaments that induce the formation of large plasma membrane lesions. Yet the signals controlling NINJ1 oligomerization and lesion opening remain unknown. Here, we combine cell biology and biophysical measurements to characterize the steps preceding NINJ1-induced PMR. Our results show that NINJ1 lesions form through a 2-step mechanism requiring oligomerization, which is triggered by signal 1, and subsequent lesion opening driven by signal 2, which we determine to be cell swelling without a concomitant increase in intracellular pressure. The close homolog NINJ2 oligomerizes with similar kinetics to NINJ1 but fails to form lesions during cell swelling. NINJ1-NINJ2 chimeras identify that the unstructured N-terminal region of NINJ1 controls lesion opening. In summary, our data establish a 2-step model for NINJ1-driven necrosis.

**Abstract:**
Tandem repeats (TRs) - highly polymorphic, repetitive sequences dispersed across the human genome - are crucial regulators of gene expression and diverse biological processes, but have remained underexplored relative to other classes of genetic variation due to historical challenges in their accurate calling and analysis. Here, we leverage whole genome and single-cell RNA sequencing from over 5.4 million blood-derived cells from 1,925 individuals to explore the impact of variation in over 1.7 million polymorphic TR loci on blood cell type-specific gene expression. We identify over 62,000 single-cell expression quantitative trait TR loci (sc-eTRs), 16.6% of which are specific to one of 28 distinct immune cell types. Further fine-mapping uncovers 4,283 sc-eTRs as candidate causal drivers of gene expression in 13.6% of genes tested genome-wide. We show through colocalization that TRs are likely mediators of genetic associations with immune-mediated and hematological traits in over 700 genes, and further identify novel TRs warranting investigation in rare disease cohorts. TRs are critical, yet long-overlooked, contributors to cell type-specific gene expression, with implications for understanding rare disease pathogenesis and the genetic architecture of complex traits.

**Abstract:**
Structural covariance in brain anatomy is thought to reflect inter-regional sharing of developmental influences - although this hypothesis has proved hard to causally test. Here, we use neuroimaging in humans and mice to study sex-differences in anatomical covariance - asking if regions that have developed shared sex differences in volume also show shared sex differences in volume covariance. This study design illuminates both the biology of sex-differenes and theoretical models for anatomical covariance - benefitting from tests of inter-species convergence. We find that volumetric structural covariance is stronger in adult females compared to adult males for both wild-type mice and healthy human subjects: 98% of all comparisons with statistically significant covariance sex differences in mice are female-biased, while 76% of all such comparisons are female-biased in humans (q < 0.05). In both species, a region's covariance and volumetric sex-biases have weak inverse relationships to each other: volumetrically male-biased regions contain more female-biased covariation (mice: r = -0.185, p = 0.002; humans: r = -0.189, p = 0.001). Our results identify a conserved tendency for females to show stronger neuroanatomical covariance than males, evident across species, which suggests that stronger structural covariance in females could be an evolutionarily conserved feature that is partially related to volumetric alterations through sex.

**Abstract:**
AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCurrent electrophysiological approaches can track the activity of many neurons, yet it is usually unknown which cell-types or brain areas are being recorded without further molecular or histological analysis. Developing accurate and scalable algorithms for identifying the cell-type and brain region of recorded neurons is thus crucial for improving our understanding of neural computation. In this work, we develop a multimodal contrastive learning approach for neural data that can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks, including inference of cell-type and brain location. We utilize this approach to jointly embed the activity autocorrelations and extracellular waveforms of individual neurons. We demonstrate that our embedding approach, Neuronal Embeddings via MultimOdal contrastive learning (NEMO), paired with supervised fine-tuning, achieves state-of-the-art cell-type classification for two opto-tagged datasets and brain region classification for the public International Brain Laboratory Brain-wide Map dataset. Our method represents a promising step towards accurate cell-type and brain region classification from electrophysiological recordings.

**Abstract:**
Mitochondria, the double membrane-bound organelles of endosymbiotic origin, are crucial centers for cellular energy production and several essential metabolic pathways. Recent studies reveal that mitochondria become dysfunctional following numerous cellular stresses, and during pathologies, demanding an extensive investigation of mitochondrial turnover mechanisms. Apart from the specific response pathways to tackle different stresses, mitophagy or degradation of mitochondria by autophagy is a critical quality control mechanism that clears irreversibly damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy is majorly executed either by receptor-mediated or PINK-Parkin-dependent pathways. Here, we show that the human orthologue of yeast Vms1, ANKZF1, participates in PINK-Parkin-mediated mitophagy. We show that ANKZF1 is extensively recruited to damaged mitochondria along with Parkin during mitochondrial proteotoxic stress induced by the expression of a single misfolded/aggregated protein or during uncoupler-induced membrane depolarization. Importantly, ANKZF1 recruitment to damaged mitochondria is significantly enhanced in the presence of Parkin, and ANKZF1 physically interacts with Parkin and LC3 during mitochondrial proteotoxic or depolarization stresses. ANKZF1 harbors six putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs), LIR4 present at residues 333-336 is particularly important for ANKZF1-LC3 interaction. Furthermore, we show that ANKZF1 knockout cells are compromised in clearing stress-damaged mitochondria by mitophagy, indicating an important role of ANKZF1 in mitochondrial turnover during stress. In summary, we show a new role of ANKZF1 in eliminating the stress-damaged mitochondria, reiterating the mito-protective role of Vms1/ANKZF1 during mitochondrial stresses.

## Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate restores TDP-43 pathology-driven genome repair deficiency in motor neuron diseases

**Abstract:**
TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In our recent discovery, we identified that TDP-43 plays an essential role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair via the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. Here, we found persistent DNA damage in the brains of ALS/FTD patients, primarily in the transcribed regions of the genome. We further investigated the underlying mechanism and found that polynucleotide kinase 3-phosphatase (PNKP) activity was severely impaired in the nuclear extracts of both patient brains and TDP-43-depleted cells. PNKP is a key player in DSB repair within the transcribed genome, where its 3-P termini processing activity is crucial for preventing persistent DNA damage and neuronal death. The inactivation of PNKP in ALS/FTD was due to reduced levels of its interacting partner, phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose 2,6 bisphosphatase (PFKFB3), and its biosynthetic product, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), an allosteric modulator of glycolysis. Recent work from our group has shown that F2,6BP acts as a positive modulator of PNKP activity in vivo. Notably, exogenous supplementation with F2,6BP restored PNKP activity in nuclear extracts from ALS/FTD brain samples and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells harboring pathological mutations. Supplementation of F2,6BP also reduced the pathogenic phosphorylation of TDP-43 and cytosolic protein aggregation, both hallmarks of ALS pathology, in patient-derived mutant cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that supplementation of F2,6BP restores genome integrity and partially rescues motor phenotype in a Drosophila model of ALS. Our findings underscore the possibility of exploring the therapeutic potential of F2,6BP or its analogs in TDP-43 pathology-associated motor neuron diseases.

## Astrocytic connexin43 phosphorylation contributes to seizure susceptibility after mild Traumatic Brain Injury

**Abstract:**
Astrocytes play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis through functional gap junctions (GJs) primarily formed by connexin43 (Cx43) in the cortical gray matter. These GJs facilitate electrical and metabolic coupling between astrocytes, allowing the passage of ions, glucose, and metabolites. Dysregulation of Cx43 has been implicated in various pathologies, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired epilepsy. After mild TBI/concussion, we previously identified a subset of atypical astrocytes, which are correlated with the development of spontaneous seizures. These astrocytes exhibit reduced Cx43 expression and coupling. However, atypical astrocytes represent a relatively small subset of astrocytes within the cortical gray matter and previous studies suggest an overall increase of Cx43 protein after TBI. Additionally, Cx43 also has non-junctional and channel-independent functions, which include hemichannel communication with the extracellular milieu, cell adhesion, protein trafficking, protein-protein interactions, and intracellular signaling. In the present study, we set out to determine how mild TBI initiates alterations to Cx43 protein expression and localization, how they may be regulated, and whether they contribute to seizure susceptibility. We demonstrate remarkable heterogeneity of Cx43 protein levels from astrocyte to astrocyte. In accordance with our previous findings, a subset of astrocytes lost Cx43 expression, yet total cortical Cx43 protein increased. At the subcellular level, junctional Cx43 protein levels remained stable, while hemichannels and/or cytoplasmic Cx43 were increased. Phosphorylation of Cx43 at serine 368, a key regulatory site influencing GJ assembly and function, increased after mild TBI. Critically, Cx43S368A mutant mice, lacking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. These findings suggest that TBI-induced Cx43 phosphorylation enhances seizure susceptibility, while inhibiting this modification presents a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure development.

Significance statementConnexin43 (Cx43) is the main protein comprising astrocyte gap junctions which mediate astrocyte coupling into cellular networks, but it also has other non-junctional functions. Many pathologies present with altered Cx43 regulation. In this study, we assessed Cx43 alterations after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a mouse model. We found that while some astrocytes lost Cx43 expression, other astrocytes had increased cytoplasmic and hemichannel Cx43. This increase correlated with an increase in phosphorylated Cx43 at serine 368. Cx43S368A mutant mice, lacking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced susceptibility to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). These findings suggest that TBI-induced Cx43 phosphorylation enhances seizure susceptibility.

**Abstract:**
Protein abundance tends to be more evolutionarily conserved than mRNA levels both within and between species, yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are widespread cis-regulatory elements in eukaryotic genomes that regulate translation, but it remains unclear whether and how uORFs contribute to stabilizing protein levels. In this study, we performed ribosome translation simulations on mRNA to quantitatively assess the extent to which uORF translation influences the translational variability of downstream coding sequences (CDSs) across varying contexts. Our simulations revealed that uORF translation dampens CDS translational variability, with buffering capacity increasing in proportion to uORF efficiency, length, and number. We then compared the translatomes at different developmental stages of two Drosophila species, demonstrating that uORFs buffer mRNA translation fluctuations during both evolution and development. Experimentally, deleting a uORF in the bicoid (bcd) gene-a prominent example of translational buffering-resulted in extensive changes in gene expression and phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster. Additionally, we observed uORF-mediated buffering between primates and within human populations. Together, our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which uORFs stabilize gene translation during development and across evolutionary time.

**Abstract:**
Protein-small molecule interactions, or receptor-ligand interactions, are essential for understanding biological processes and advancing drug design. Despite advancements, existing prediction models of these interactions still lack the capabilities and accuracy needed to replace traditional screening. In this paper, we introduce DockFormer, a method that leverages multi-modal learning to predict both the binding affinity and structure of these interactions. DockFormer employs fully flexible docking, where no part of the receptor remains rigid, by adapting the AlphaFold2 architecture. Instead of relying on protein sequences and Multiple Sequence Alignments, DockFormer uses predicted receptor structures as input. This modification enables the model to concentrate on ligand docking prediction rather than protein folding, while preserving full receptor flexibility. The streamlined design also reduces the model size to just 8 layers, compared to AlphaFold2's 48 layers, greatly accelerating the inference process and making it more efficient for large-scale screening. When evaluated on affinity benchmarks such as CASF-2016, PLINDER, and the recently released CASP16 ligand screening benchmark, DockFormer performs comparably to or better than state-of-the-art methods, which typically rely on templates or bound structures as input. On structural benchmarks such as Posebusters and PLINDER, DockFormer demonstrated success rates of 20% and 15%, respectively.

**Abstract:**
Genetically modified, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising allogeneic source for the generation of functionally enhanced, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. However, the signaling of CARs during early T cell development and the removal of the endogenous T cell receptor required to prevent alloreactivity pose significant challenges to the production of mature conventional CAR T cells from iPSCs. Here, we show that TCR-null, CD8{beta} CAR T cells can be efficiently generated from iPSCs by engineering stage-specific onset of CAR expression and signaling to both permit conventional T cell development and to induce efficient positive selection. CAR T cells produced using this approach displayed a uniform, naive T cell phenotype and demonstrated superior antigen-specific cytotoxicity compared to iPSC-derived effector memory CAR T cells. Multimodal sequencing revealed CAR-mediated positive selection induced the persistent upregulation of key transcription factors involved in naive T cell development. Achieving precise control of CAR expression and signaling in developmentally sensitive T precursors will be critical to realizing the full potential for "off-the-shelf", iPSC-derived cellular therapies.

**Abstract:**
Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) provides high-resolution imaging and morphological information over large fields of view, while Computational Scattered Light Imaging (ComSLI) excels at mapping interwoven fiber organization in unstained tissue sections. This study introduces Fourier Ptychographic Scattered Light Microscopy (FP-SLM), a new multi-modal approach that combines FPM and ComSLI analyses to create both high-resolution phase-contrast images and fiber orientation maps from a single dataset. The method is demonstrated on a state-of-the-art setup that was originally used for FPM and one that was originally used for ComSLI, and the outputs are quantitatively compared to each other on brain sections (frog, monkey) and sections from thigh muscle and knee (mouse). FP-SLM delivers high-resolution images while revealing fiber organization in nerve, muscle, tendon, cartilage, and bone tissues. The approach is validated by comparing the computed fiber orientations with those derived from structure tensor analysis of the high-resolution images. The comparison shows that FPM and ComSLI are compatible with each other and yield fully consistent results. Remarkably, this combination surpasses the sum of its parts, so that applying ComSLI analysis to FPM recordings and vice-versa outperforms both methods alone. FP-SLM can be retrospectively applied to analyze any existing dataset acquired from a setup that was originally built for FPM or ComSLI alone (consisting of LED array and low numerical aperture), without need to build or design an extra setup. This significantly expands the application range of both techniques and enhances the study of complex tissue architectures in biomedical research.

## Cortical microtubules act as a template to organize nano-scale patterning of the SEC/MUNC protein KEULE and exocytosis

**Abstract:**
Targeting of exocytosis enables cellular morphogenesis, motility and polarized transport, yet relatively little is known about the targeting mechanisms in cellular systems. Here we show that the SEC/MUNC protein KEULE is a dynamic marker for individual secretory events and employ it as a live cell probe, that together with high-precision image analysis of thousands of events, reveal that cortical microtubule arrays act as two-dimensional templates that pattern exocytosis at the nano-scale in higher plant cells. This mechanism is distinct from previously described mechanisms involving motor-driven transport and defines ordered and adjacent linear domains where secretory events are higher and lower than expected, effectively redistributing exocytosis over most of the cell membrane. In addition, analysis of KEULE kinetics revealed distinct phases of assembly/disassembly that are differentially sensitive to experimental treatments that reduce exocytosis, revealing SEC/MUNC dynamics as a versatile and information rich read-out of exocytosis in vivo.

**Abstract:**
Symbiotic systems of photosynthetic microorganisms and fungi are widespread in terrestrial biomes and lichens are probably the most advanced and complex. Conversely, the least complex systems are "green biofilms" with a completely unexplored mycobiome. We describe here a new system intermediate between green biofilms and lichens - semilichens. Light and fluorescence microscopy, eDNA sequencing, molecular phylogeny, Chlorophyll a fluorescence and 13C labelling/metabolomics were used to study algal and fungal identity, morphology and physiology of the symbiosis. Tight contact between algae and a single predominant fungus (mycobiont) is revealed in semilichens. The algae are from the symbiotic lineages of Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae, the fungi belong to Arthoniomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Lecanoromycetes and Lichinomycetes. Algae are alive and perform substantial photosynthetic activity. 13C labelled photosynthates are partially converted into specific fungal polyols (arabitol, mannitol) demonstrating the C-flow from algae to fungi. The new symbiotic system was defined and compared with other terrestrial algal-fungal symbioses. It is characterized by minimalist environmental requirements and extremely low production of biomass. As a result, it also inhabits environments unfavourable for lichens. Our research supports the hypothesis that the long-term existence of algae and fungi in terrestrial conditions affected by frequent and repeated drying is likely dependent on their mutual coexistence.

**Abstract:**
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins crucial to numerous diseases, yet many remain poorly characterized and untargeted by drugs. Chimeric GPCRs have emerged as valuable tools for elucidating GPCR function by facilitating the identification of signaling pathways, resolving structures, and discovering novel ligands of poorly understood GPCRs. Such chimeric GPCRs are obtained by merging a well- and less-well-characterized GPCR at the intracellular limits of their transmembrane regions or intracellular loops, leveraging knowledge transfer from the well-characterized GPCR. However, despite the 212 chimeric GPCRs engineered to date, the design process remains largely trial-and-error and lacks a standardized approach. To address this gap, we introduce GPCRchimeraDB (https://www.bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/), the first comprehensive database dedicated to chimeric GPCRs. It catalogs 212 chimeric receptors, identified through literature review, and includes 1,755 class A natural GPCRs, enabling connections between chimeras and their parent receptors while facilitating the exploration of novel parent combinations. Both chimeric and natural GPCR entries are extensively described at the sequence, structural, and biophysical level through a range of visualization tools, with annotations from resources like UniProt and GPCRdb and predictions from AlphaFold2 and b2btools. Additionally, GPCRchimeraDB offers a GPCR sequence aligner and a feature comparator to investigate differences between natural and chimeric receptors. It also provides design guidelines to support rational chimera engineering. GPCRchimeraDB is therefore a resource to facilitate and optimize the design of new chimeras, so helping to gain insights into poorly characterized receptors and contributing to advances in GPCR therapeutic development.

## Lysine deacetylation inhibition reverses TDP-43 mislocalization and in combination with arimoclomol ameliorates neuromuscular pathology

**Abstract:**
Cytoplasmic inclusions containing TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) are recognized as a major pathological feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Cyclophilin A (PPIA) interacts with TDP-43 and influences its aggregation and function. This interaction is facilitated by PPIA Lys-acetylation. We investigated the effect of lysine deacetylation inhibition to uncover the underlying mechanisms of TDP-43 proteinopathy in relation to PPIA acetylation, and to identify new therapeutic avenues. Through a screening of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in a cellular model of TDP-43 proteinopathy, we identified vorinostat/SAHA, capable of increasing PPIA acetylation, as the most effective in reversing TDP-43 mislocalization. We confirmed its effect in PBMCs from ALS patients and explored its impact on proteinopathy and PPIA acetylation in the Thy1-hTDP-43 mouse model. Thy1-hTDP-43 mice treated with SAHA showed a delayed onset of TDP-43 pathology, associated with PPIA nucleus-cytoplasm redistribution, lower neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, and improved neuromuscular function markers. However, the effect was only temporary. When combined with the heat shock protein (HSP) co-inducer arimoclomol, a mitigation of the neurodegeneration was sustained. A synergistic effect was observed in periphery, greatly enhancing tubulin acetylation and reducing pTDP-43 accumulation in the sciatic nerve and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) {gamma}-subunit expression in gastrocnemius muscle. This study suggests that HDAC inhibition, by increasing acetylated PPIA, could be beneficial in restoring TDP-43 localization and function. The combination of lysine deacetylation inhibition and HSP induction shows a synergistic effect in vivo and has potential as a therapeutic approach for patients.

**Abstract:**
Copious expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is associated with poor survival in many types of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia. We observed that a specific acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) cell line (6133) derived from RBM15-MKL1 knock-in mice exhibited heterogeneity in Prmt1 expression levels. Interestingly, only a subpopulation of 6133 cells expressing high levels of Prmt1 caused leukemia when transplanted into congenic mice. The PRMT1 inhibitor, MS023, effectively cured this PRMT1-driven leukemia. Seahorse analysis revealed that PRMT1 increased the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and decreased the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Consistently, PRMT1 accelerated glucose consumption and led to the accumulation of lactic acid in the leukemia cells. The metabolomic analysis supported that PRMT1 stimulated the intracellular accumulation of lipids, which was further validated by FACS analysis with BODIPY 493/503. In line with fatty acid accumulation, PRMT1 downregulated the protein level of CPT1A, which is involved in the rate-limiting step of fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, administering the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) delayed AMKL progression and promoted cell differentiation. Ectopic expression of Cpt1a rescued the proliferation of 6133 cells ectopically expressing PRMT1 in the glucose-minus medium. In conclusion, PRMT1 upregulates glycolysis and downregulates fatty acid oxidation to enhance the proliferation capability of AMKL cells.

**Abstract:**
Beta-arrestins are multifunctional regulators of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, orchestrating diverse downstream signaling events and physiological responses across the vast GPCR superfamily. While GPCR pharmacology has advanced to target orthosteric and allosteric sites, as well as G proteins and GRKs, comparable chemical tools to study beta-arrestins remain lacking. Here, we report the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors that selectively target beta-arrestins and delineate their mechanism of action through integrated pharmacological, biochemical, biophysical, and structural analyses. These inhibitors disrupt beta-arrestin-engagement with agonist-activated GPCRs, impairing desensitization, internalization, and beta-arrestin-dependent functions while sparing G protein-receptor coupling. Cryo-EM, MD simulations, and structure-guided mutagenesis reveal that one modulator, Cmpd-5, engages a cryptic pocket formed by the middle, C-, and lariat loops of beta-arrestin1-a critical receptor-binding interface-stabilizing a distinct conformation incompatible with GPCR engagement. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic framework for beta-arrestin modulation, introducing transducer-targeted strategies to fine-tune GPCR signaling and guide the development of pathway-specific therapeutics.

**Abstract:**
Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 protein (LGI1) is a secreted neuronal protein consisting of the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and C-terminal epitempin repeat (EPTP) domains. LGI1 is linked to epilepsy, a neurological disorder that can be caused by genetic mutations of genes regulating neuronal excitability (e.g., voltage- or ligand-gated ion channels). ADAM22 is a membrane receptor that binds to LGI1 extracellularly and interacts with AMPA-type glutamate receptors via PSD-95 intracellularly to maintain normal synaptic signal transmission. Structural analysis of the LGI1-ADAM22 complex is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of epileptogenesis and developing new therapies against epilepsy. We previously reported the crystal structure of a 2:2 complex consisting of two molecules of LGI1 and two molecules of the ADAM22 ectodomain (ECD), which is suggested to bridge neurons across the synaptic cleft. On the other hand, multiangle light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and cryo-EM analyses have suggested the existence of a 3:3 complex consisting of three molecules of LGI1 and three molecules of ADAM22. In the previous cryo-EM analysis, many observed particles were in a dissociated state, making it difficult to determine the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the 3:3 complex. In this study, we stabilized the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complex using chemical crosslinking and determined the cryo-EM structures of the LGI1LRR-LGI1EPTP-ADAM22ECD and 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complexes at 2.78 [A] and 3.79 [A] resolutions, respectively. Furthermore, high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) visualized the structural features and flexibility of the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complex in solution. We discuss new insights into the interaction modes of the LGI1-ADAM22 higher-order complex and the structural properties of the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22 complex.

Structural variation, involving large alterations in chromosome structure, drives genetic diversification and the emergence of new phenotypes. These changes are widespread in natural populations and play an important role in adaptation and speciation. For many species, research has been limited to laboratory adapted strains and experimental evolution, which may not reflect the diversity of structural variants in the wild. Furthermore, technological limitations have proved to be a major barrier to accurate and comprehensive variant calling. In this study, we used PacBio sequencing data from 14 wild Caenorhabditis elegans strains to characterize structural variants in a natural population. With long-reads, we overcame limitations associated with short-read approaches and leveraged population-level data to further refine the accuracy of variant calls. We found that large, rapidly evolving gene families, such as GPCR, F-Box, and C-Type lectin, were prominent among the variants predicted to have phenotypic consequences. These results shed light on the significant role of structural variants in the evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans in its wild habitats and the limitations of treating N2 as the reference wild-type.

**Abstract:**
Aims: To standardise and automate the quantitation of human-unique neuromelanin granules in catecholamine neurons in post-mortem tissue sections from healthy individuals at different ages to understand any changes in these granules with age. Methods: 5-6m thick fixed and paraffin-embedded transverse midbrain tissue sections were supplied from 47 cases from three brain banks following ethics approvals. Sections were prepared and automated digital images acquired. Standardisation and automation of the quantification of neuromelanin granules was performed using the TruAI feature of the Olympus VS200 desktop platform. Comparisons between stained and unstained sections as well as correlations with age were performed. Results: The automated platform reliably identified both stained and unstained intracellular and extracellular neuromelanin granules, showing high reproducibility in measurements across laboratories using different tissue processing methods. Extracellular neuromelanin granules were significantly smaller than intracellular neuromelanin granules. Sections processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining impacted on size and colour of both neuromelanin and the neurons containing neuromelanin. Hematoxylin made neuromelanin bluer and the increased tissue processing made the intracellular area occupied by neuromelanin smaller in younger people. There was an increase in neuromelanin optical density and colour change (more brown) with age. Conclusions: The TruAI automated platform reliably quantifies individual neuromelanin granules in catecholamine neurons. Extracellular neuromelanin is considerably smaller in size than intracellular neuromelanin, and intracellular neuromelanin changes its properties with age. The darkening and colour change of intracellular neuromelanin suggests an increase in eumelanin over time in healthy individuals. These changes can be reliably identified using the automated platform.

**Abstract:**
Sensory substitution devices (SSDs) convert images to sounds to equip blind individuals with nominally visual functions, like face or letter sensitivity. Prior studies showed that image-to-sound SSDs engage cortices ordinarily specialised for visual functions. However, the brain dynamics of SSD-supported perception remains unknown. Either visual cortices are the first locus of discrimination of SSD percepts, or their activation is a byproduct of perceptual processes unfurling elsewhere, such as in auditory cortices. Resolving this uncertainty is critical for understanding the contribution of visual cortices to mechanisms subserving SSD-induced perceptions in the blind. Using electrical neuroimaging of EEG data from congenitally blind adults, we show for the first time that visual cortices are the earliest site of face and letter sensitivity when conveyed via SSDs, though with distinct temporal dynamics and spatial localizations. In the case of faces versus scrambled faces, differences first manifested at 460ms post-stimulus onset as topographic EEG modulations that were in turn localized to a network of right-hemisphere regions, including the fusiform face area (FFA) as well as lateral occipital cortices. In the case of discerning vertically versus horizontally oriented letter shapes, differences first manifested at 370ms post-stimulus onset as topographic EEG modulations that were localized to a network of left-hemisphere regions, including the occipital pole and the occipito-temporal junction extending into the angular gyrus. Notably, early-latency auditory evoked potentials did not differ based on visual properties of the soundscapes. These collective data support the proposition that responses to soundscapes are routed to brain circuits ordinarily specialized for processing visual information and that these circuits are the loci of the initial discriminant processes. By providing the temporal dynamics of SSD perception, our findings provide unique evidence for the theory that cortices are characterised by task-contingent functional organisation.

**Abstract:**
The nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR) required for cell death (NRC) family represents a group of helper NLRs that are required by sensor NLRs to execute hypersensitive cell death during pathogen infection. NRCs contain an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain essential for their function, yet our knowledge of how this domain contributes to NRC function remains limited. Here, we identified a novel hydrophobic feature within the CC domain that contributes to NRC-mediated immunity. We screened for conserved hydrophobic residues among NRCs and identified seven required for NRC4-mediated cell death. Structural analysis revealed that four of these residues form a hydrophobic core in the CC domain. This hydrophobic core is important for NRC4 subcellular localization, oligomerization, and phospholipid association, but not for NRC4 focal accumulation at the extrahaustorial membrane during Phytophthora infestans infection. Sequence analysis and functional assays revealed this core is highly conserved in NRCs and some singleton NLRs but has degenerated in NRC-dependent sensor NLRs. Our study identifies a novel hydrophobic feature in the CC domain of NRCs and reveals its contribution to NLR-mediated immunity.

**Abstract:**
Macrophages are a highly plastic innate immune cell subset that depends on environmental cues to activate, execute and resolve inflammatory responses. This plasticity of function is mirrored by the diversity of RNA modifications that dynamically decorate macrophage transcripts. Here, using the mouse macrophage line RAW 264.7 (RAW), we addressed the combinatorial effect of two major mRNA modifications: adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) deamination by ADAR1 and adenosine N6-methylation (m6A) by METTL3. Using both short-read and single molecule sequencing on RAW macrophages with genetic deletions of ADAR1 or METTL3, we identified transcripts that were modified by both enzymes, with specific functional outcomes on macrophage activation. While m6A levels remained relatively stable even in the absence of ADAR1, loss of METTL3 led to a global reduction in A-to-I editing levels. This interrelation was most apparent when m6A sites were distant from sites of deamination, suggesting a possible function of m6A in ADAR1-mediated editing. Using a dual reporter cell line where guided ADAR1 recruitment can be measured via eGFP reactivation, we observed that m6A modification of ADAR-engager guide RNAs substantially improved targeted RNA editing. Overall, we report the first example of an interdependence between modifications, which can also be therapeutically exploited.

**Abstract:**
Assessment of pharmacological intervention on in vitro neural systems often emphasizes molecular and structural changes. However, neural systems fundamentally process and act on information. For preclinical assays to predict drug efficacy, they must model these physiological functions. DishBrain, an in vitro synthetic biological intelligence (SBI) assay embodying a neural system in a simulated game-world, enables the quantification of this information-processing capacity, however the question remains whether such a system permits classical pharmacological interrogation and dose-response profiling. Hyperactive glutamatergic dysregulation is linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy, and inducible overexpression of neurogenin 2 (NGN2) in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) generates glutamatergic cultures with dysregulated hyperactivity. We therefore tested three anti-seizure medications (ASMs), phenytoin, perampanel, and carbamazepine, on NGN2 neurons from day 21 of differentiation in this system. The key finding was that, while all compounds altered spontaneous firing, carbamazepine 200 {micro}M significantly improved gameplay metrics. This marks the first demonstration of altered SBI following exogenous drug treatment. Notably, only inhibitory compounds enhanced goal-directed activity, linking glutamatergic attenuation to performance. Neurocomputational analysis revealed nuanced pharmacological responses during closed-loop stimulation, highlighting insights beyond spontaneous activity metrics.

## AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is essential for tendon homeostasis and prevents premature senescence and ectopic calcification

**Abstract:**
Tendinopathy is a debilitating tendon disorder affecting millions of people, characterized by pain, swelling, and diminished biomechanical properties. While the precise mechanisms underlying tendon homeostasis remain unclear, metabolic regulation plays a critical role. In this study, we combine transcriptomic analysis of human tendinopathic samples with a conditional mouse model in which Prkaa1 (encoding AMPK1) is selectively deleted in tendon progenitors to elucidate the role of AMPK signaling in tendon homeostasis. RNA sequencing of diseased human tendons revealed downregulation of key metabolic genes, including several involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and AMPK signaling pathways, alongside an increase in markers associated with senescence and a secretory inflammatory profile. In parallel, mice with loss of Prkaa1 function exhibited normal postnatal development; however, by one month of age, tendons demonstrated widespread transcriptional alterations related to cell cycle regulation and ECM organization. By three months, AMPK1-deficient tendons showed significant reductions in mechanical strength and increased expression of senescence markers p21 and p16, progressing to prominent ectopic calcification with age. In vitro studies further confirmed that tendon fibroblasts lacking AMPK1 have altered ECM substrate adhesion profiles. Importantly, voluntary exercise partially rescued these deficits by enhancing ECM organization and reducing senescence marker expression. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that AMPK1 is critical for maintaining energy balance, regulating ECM remodeling, and preventing premature cellular senescence in tendon. These insights highlight AMPK signaling as a promising therapeutic target and underscore the beneficial role of exercise in mitigating tendinopathic changes.

**Abstract:**
Chronic unhealthy sleeping behaviours are a major risk factor for the emergence of mood and anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, we are still lacking understanding why some individuals are more prone than others to affective dysregulation caused by sleep disruption. With preliminary evidence suggesting that brain activity during positive and negative emotional processing might play an important modulating role, we conducted whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses in a large cohort of healthy young adults (N = 155). Using regions consistently affected in insomnia disorder as seeds, we investigated sleep quality-related neural connectivity patterns that were both insensitive and sensitive to the interactions with individual measures of reward and punishment processing, additionally assessing the links with indices of emotional health. The majority of the findings reflected interactions between sleep quality and reinforcement sensitivity, with the opposite associations reported in the good and poor sleepers. One of such connections, the coupling between precentral gyrus and posterior insula, was additionally negatively linked to trait anxiety, with the lowest connectivity values observed in poor sleepers with higher sensitivity to punishment. In turn, the only finding associated solely with sleep quality, i.e. coupling between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus, was also related to the habitual use of emotion suppression strategies. As such, the present study provides evidence that reinforcement sensitivity plays an essential role in understanding the associations of poor sleep quality with brain connectivity and emotional health, hinting at a potential link that may help explain individual differences in susceptibility to sleep-related affective dysregulation.

**Abstract:**
Somatic structural variations (SVs) are critical genomic alterations in cancer genomes. Long-read sequencing (LRS) is theoretically optimal for detecting somatic SVs. However, influenced by reads-to-reference alignment errors, particularly in low-complexity or highly repetitive genomic intervals, current LRS-based somatic SV callers fail to accurately detect SVs. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive ground-truth datasets hinders accurate evaluation. Here, we introduce SVscope, a novel algorithm that fundamentally addresses these challenges by leveraging full-length sequence information from span-reads and integrating local graph-genome optimization with a random forest strategy. SVscope outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six paired long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) benchmark cell lines, achieving a maximum F1-score improvement of 16.7%. In simulated datasets, SVscope demonstrates superior performance in both somatic SV detection and read phasing tasks. Based on the findings from SVscope, we validated 47 somatic SVs, thereby significantly expanding the existing experimentally validated ground-truth somatic SV dataset by 69.1%.

**Abstract:**
Plasmodium falciparum Pfs230 and Pfs48/45, part of a core fertilization complex, are leading malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates. However, how the two proteins interact is unknown. Here we report a 3.36 [A] resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the endogenous Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex. We show that Pfs48/45 interacts with Pfs230 domains 13 and 14, domains that are not included in current Pfs230 vaccine immunogens. Using a transgenic parasite line with a domain 13 to 14 deletion, we show that these domains are essential for Pfs230 localization on the gamete surface. Furthermore, this line significantly reduced oocyst formation in the mosquito midgut, showing that the presence of Pfs230 domains 13 and 14 is critical for successful fertilization. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibit Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation, reduce transmission and structural analyses reveal their binding epitopes. Furthermore, domains 13 and 14 are targets of naturally acquired immunity and when delivered as mRNA-LNP immunizations induce potent immune responses and blocked transmission of malaria parasites. Our comprehensive structural insights on a core P. falciparum fertilization complex will guide the design of novel transmission-blocking vaccine candidates against malaria.

## Unlocking the Distinct Roles of the Three Mammalian VDAC Isoforms in Mitochondrial Respiration and Cancer Cell Metabolism

**Abstract:**
The Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) is the most ubiquitous protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane. This channel facilitates the flux of water-soluble metabolites and ions like calcium across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Beyond this canonical role, VDAC has been implicated, through interactions with protein partners, in several cellular processes such as apoptosis, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. There are three VDAC isoforms in mammalian cells, VDAC 1, 2, and 3, with varying tissue-specific expression profiles. From a biophysical standpoint, all three isoforms can conduct metabolites and ions with similar efficiency. However, isoform knockouts (KOs) in mice lead to distinct phenotypes, which may be due to differences in VDAC isoform interactions with partner proteins. To understand the functional role of each VDAC isoform within a single cell type, we created functional KOs of each isoform in HeLa cells and performed a comparative study of their metabolic activity and proteomics. We found that each isoform KO alters the proteome differently, with VDAC3 KO dramatically downregulating key members of the electron transport chain (ETC) while shifting the mitochondria into a glutamine-dependent state. Importantly, this unexpected dependence of mitochondrial function on the VDAC3 isoform is not compensated by the more ubiquitously expressed VDAC1 and VDAC2 isoforms. In contrast, VDAC2 KO did not affect respiration but upregulated ETC components and decreased key enzymes in the glutamine metabolic pathway. VDAC1 KO specifically reduced glycolytic activity linked to decreased hexokinase localization to mitochondria. These results reveal non-redundant roles of VDAC isoforms in cancer cell metabolic adaptability.

**Abstract:**
Calcineurin is a highly conserved phosphatase that plays a central role in sensing calcium and governing transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational signaling networks. Calcineurin is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic A subunit and a regulatory B subunit. Through downstream effectors, calcineurin signaling drives myriad responses in different organisms. In the fungal pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex that infects humans, calcineurin governs thermotolerance and is essential for growth at high temperature and pathogenesis. In Cryptococcus deneoformans, the underlying molecular functions of this critical signaling cascade are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a genetic screen and identified genetic changes that suppress the requirement for calcineurin during high-temperature growth. Our results identified two mechanisms that bypass the requirement for calcineurin function. The first mechanism involves segmental aneuploidy via both amplification as well as loss of chromosome fragments. The second mechanism involves dominant amino acid substitution mutations in the genes encoding three proteins, Chs6, Imp2, and Cts1, orthologs of components of the Ingression Progression Complex required for septation and budding in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Loss of calcineurin activity causes chitin and chitosan accumulation and severe budding defects, whereas suppressor mutations largely restore growth and cytokinesis in the absence of calcineurin. These findings reveal the calcineurin signaling cascade controls a conserved cytokinesis machinery at the mitotic exit network during thermal stress.

## A vectorial code for semantics in human hippocampus

**Abstract:**
As we listen to speech, our brains actively compute the meaning of individual words. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we hypothesized that the brain employs vectorial coding principles, such that meaning is reflected in distributed activity of single neurons. We recorded responses of hundreds of neurons in the human hippocampus, which has a well-established role in semantic coding, while participants listened to narrative speech. We find encoding of contextual word meaning in the simultaneous activity of neurons whose individual selectivities span multiple unrelated semantic categories. Like embedding vectors in semantic models, distance between neural population responses correlates with semantic distance; however, this effect was only observed in contextual embedding models (like BERT) and was reversed in non-contextual embedding models (like Word2Vec), suggesting that the semantic distance effect depends critically on contextualization. Moreover, for the subset of highly semantically similar words, even contextual embedders showed an inverse correlation between semantic and neural distances; we attribute this pattern to the noise-mitigating benefits of contrastive coding. Finally, in further support for the critical role of context, we find that range of neural responses covaries with lexical polysemy. Ultimately, these results support the hypothesis that semantic coding in the hippocampus follows vectorial principles.

## Hyperreflexia after corticospinal tract lesion reflects 1A afferent circuit changes not increased KCC2 hyperexcitability

**Abstract:**
Hyperreflexia is a consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI) and motor system lesions in the brain Two major mechanisms underpinning hyperreflexia have been reported: proprioceptive afferent (PA) circuit changes produced by 1A fiber sprouting, which could enhance reflex signaling, together with reduced GABAergic inhibitory presynaptic regulation (GABApre); and increased intrinsic motor neuron excitability, for example, produced by reduced motor neuron membrane-bound potassium-chloride co-transporter2 (KCC2). Here we examine how selective unilateral CST injury in the medullary pyramid (PTX), which eliminates the CST from one hemisphere, allows for specific investigation of the different mechanisms to determine their contributions to hyperreflexia. We used rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the Hoffmann (H)-reflex for the forelimb and hindlimb 5th-digit abductor muscles to assess hyperreflexia on both the contra-and ipsilesional sides. We compared RDD in naive and unilateral-PTX rats at 7-dpi and 42-dpi, supplemented with additional timepoints to examine hyperreflexia development.

Immunohistochemistry was used to identify PA synapses (VGlut1), GABA presynaptic boutons (GABApre), motor neurons (ChAT), and to measure KCC2. Following unilateral PTX, we observed significant hyperreflexia in the contralesional forelimb only. Membrane-bound KCC2 was unchanged in contralesional cervical motor neurons. Whereas both cervical and lumbar motor neurons showed increased PA sprouting contralesionally, there was a concomitant increase in GABApre terminals for the lumbar not cervical cord, which associated with a normal hindlimb H-reflex. Our findings show that KCC2 is disassociated from hyperreflexia in the uniPTX model. Instead, forelimb hyperreflexia can be explained by cervical motor neuron PA sprouting and an uncompensated GABApre regulation.

**Abstract:**
Fluorescent imaging enables visualization of the specific molecules of interest with high contrast, and the use of multiple fluorophores in a single tissue sample allows visualization of complex relationships between biological molecules, cell types, and anatomy. The utility of fluorescent imaging in human tissue has been limited by endogenous pigments that can block the light path or emit an autofluorescence, thereby interfering with the specific imaging of target molecules. Although photobleachers have been developed to quench endogenous pigments, the lack of customizability limits their utility for a broad range of applications. Here, we present a high luminous-intensity photobleacher that is based on rigorous simulations of illumination patterns using the laws of radiation, along with the framework to maximize bleaching efficiency. This open-source project is designed to help researchers customize and scale according to the tissue types and the research goals. The photobleacher is applicable to both thin tissue slices and large-volume cleared tissue samples to enable serial three-dimensional imaging of postmortem human brain using multiplexed antibody or oligonucleotide probes.

**Abstract:**
We present the first causal evidence in the healthy human brain linking the central thalamus to vigilance and the pulvinar to visuospatial attention using low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS). In a within-subjects, counterbalanced design, 27 healthy volunteers completed the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), a vigilance task, and the Egly-Driver Task (EDT), which assesses visuospatial attention, before and after central thalamus, pulvinar, and sham sonication with tFUS. Central thalamic sonication significantly impaired performance on both tasks in a manner consistent with decreases in arousal. Targeting the pulvinar with tFUS resulted in more subtle changes in visuospatial attention. Participants were less reactive to visual stimuli presented in the visual field contralateral to the affected pulvinar. These results demonstrate that tFUS can elicit measurable behavioral changes in healthy volunteers and underscores its potential as a high-resolution tool for non-invasive brain mapping, capable of differentiating functional contributions of thalamic regions only millimeters apart.

## CDState: an unsupervised approach to predict malignant cell heterogeneity in tumor bulk RNA-sequencing data

**Abstract:**
Intratumor transcriptional heterogeneity (ITTH) presents a major challenge in cancer treatment, particularly due to limited understanding of the diverse malignant cell populations and their relationship to therapy resistance. While single-cell sequencing has provided valuable insights into tumor composition, its high cost and technical complexity limits its use for large-scale tumor screening. In contrast, several databases collecting bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from multiple samples across various cancer types are available and could be used to profile ITTH. Several deconvolution approaches have been developed to infer cellular composition from such data. However, most of these methods rely on predefined markers or single cell reference datasets, limiting the performance of such methods by the quality of used reference data. Although unsupervised approaches do not face such limitations, existing methods have not been specifically adapted to characterize malignant cell states, and focus instead on general cell types. To address these gaps, we introduce CDState, an unsupervised method for inferring malignant cell subpopulations from bulk RNA-seq data. CDState utilizes a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization model improved with sum-to-one constraints and a cosine similarity-based optimization to deconvolve bulk gene expression into distinct cell state-specific profiles, and estimate the abundance of each state across tumor samples. We validate CDState using bulkified single-cell RNA-seq data from five cancer types, showing that it outperforms existing unsupervised deconvolution methods in both cell state proportions and gene expression estimation. Applying CDState to 33 cancer types from TCGA, we identified recurrent malignant cell programs, with epithelial-mesenchymal transition as the main driver of tumor transcriptional heterogeneity. We further link the identified malignant states to patient clinical features, revealing states associated with worse patient prognosis. We show that ITTH is linked with patient survival and clinical features, as well as is associated with varied responses to therapy. Finally, we identified potential genetic drivers of ITTH and malignant cell states, including TP53, KRAS, and PIK3CA, known oncogenic genes.

**Abstract:**
Deep learning methods have been developed to predict gene expression levels across various cell and tissue types based on DNA-binding sites of protein identified by ChIP-seq. However, the experimental identification of DNA/RNA-binding sites and the functional characterization of certain proteins remain challenging. Here I predicted the regulatory target genes and functional roles of DNA/RNA-binding proteins using gene co-expression data. Gene co-expression correlations are derived from gene expression profiles across cells and tissues and represent interactions between a DNA/RNA-binding protein and other genes. I used these interactions to predict gene expression levels by partially replacing the input data in the deep learning analysis. Functional annotations statistically overrepresented in the predicted target genes of ten DNA/RNA-binding proteins examined in this study were consistent with their known biological roles. Furthermore, several annotations not present in current gene function databases were supported by findings in previously published studies.

**Abstract:**
Tinnitus, the perception of sound without an external source, affects a significant portion of the population, yet its impact on brain communication diagram known as the functional connectome, remains limited. Traditional functional connectivity (FC) methods, such as Pearson correlation, phase lag index and coherence rely on pairwise comparisons and are therefore limited in providing a holistic encoding of FC. Here, we employ an alternative approach to estimate the entire connectivity structure by analyzing all time-courses simultaneously. This approach is robust even for short-duration recordings, facilitating faster functional connectome identification and real-time applications. Using resting-state MEG recordings from controls and individuals with tinnitus, we demonstrated that the learned connectomes outperform correlation-based connectomes in fingerprinting, that is, identifying an individual from test-retest acquisitions. Group-level analysis revealed distinct altered FC in tinnitus across multiple frequency bands, affecting the default mode, auditory, visual, and salience networks, suggesting a reorganization of these large-scale networks beyond auditory areas. Our study reveals that tinnitus presents highly individualized and heterogeneous whole-brain connectome profiles, highlighting the need to focus on individual variability rather than group-level differences to gain a more nuanced understanding of tinnitus. Personalized FC could enable patient-specific tinnitus models, optimizing treatment strategies for individualized care.

**Abstract:**
Influenza continues to pose significant global health threats, hijacking host cellular machinery through protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are fundamental to viral entry, replication, immune evasion, and transmission. Yet, our understanding of these host-virus PPIs remains incomplete due to the vast diversity of viral proteins, their rapid mutation rates, and the limited availability of experimentally validated interaction data. Additionally, existing computational methods often struggle due to the limited availability of high-quality samples and their inability to effectively model the complex nature of host-virus interactions. To address these challenges, we present SEHI-PPI, an end-to-end framework for human-influenza PPI prediction. SEHI-PPI integrates a double-view deep learning architecture that captures both global and local sequence features, coupled with a novel adaptive negative sampling strategy to generate reliable and high-quality negative samples. Our method outperforms multiple benchmarks, including state-of-the-art large language models, achieving a superior performance in sensitivity (0.986) and AUROC (0.987). Notably, in a stringent test involving entirely unseen human and influenza protein families, SEHI-PPI maintains strong performance with an AUROC of 0.837. The model also demonstrates high generalizability across other human-virus PPI datasets, with an average sensitivity of 0.929 and AUROC of 0.928. Furthermore, AlphaFold3-guided case studies reveal that viral proteins predicted to target the same human protein cluster together structurally and functionally, underscoring the biological relevance of our predictions. These discoveries demonstrate the reliability of our SEHI-PPI framework in uncovering biologically meaningful host-virus interactions and potential therapeutic targets.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

**Abstract:**
Despite intensive study, gaps remain in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to limited contextual metadata accompanying most large genomic surveillance datasets. We analyzed over 130,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, over 85,000 with matched epidemiological data, collected in Massachusetts from November 2021 to January 2023, to investigate viral transmission dynamics at high resolution. The data were drawn from diagnostic testing at >600 facilities representing schools, workplaces, public testing, and other sectors, and encompass the emergence of six major viral lineages, each representing a new outbreak. We found urban areas as key hubs for new lineage introduction and interurban transmission as facilitating spread throughout the state. Young adults, especially those on college campuses, served as early indicators of emerging lineage dominance. Resident-aged populations in college campuses and nursing homes exhibited a higher likelihood of being linked to within-facility transmission, while staff-aged at those facilities were more linked to their surrounding community. Individuals with recent vaccine doses, including boosters, had a lower likelihood of initiating transmission. This dataset shows the value of linking genomic and epidemiologic data at scale for higher resolution insights into viral dynamics and their implication for public health strategy.

**Abstract:**
IntroductionPneumonia is a leading cause of under-five mortality, with 30 million annual cases in India. Despite national guidelines, significant barriers to timely and appropriate care-seeking persist. Caregivers often face financial constraints, lack of awareness, mistrust in government facilities, and a preference for non-registered medical practitioners (non-RMP), delaying effective treatment. This study explores care-seeking behaviors, associated sociodemographic factors, and barriers to access to appropriate healthcare for childhood pneumonia in rural India.

MethodsThis study is part of a broader implementation research (IR) initiative and represents its formative phase. This mixed-methods study was conducted in Palwal district, Haryana, covering 42 villages (population: 107,440). A cross-sectional survey identified suspected pneumonia cases among 9,593 under-five children through house-to-house visits using a structured checklist. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, health insurance, care-seeking patterns, and provider preferences were collected. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) identified potential confounders in the association between care-seeking behaviour and key exposure variables. Additionally, qualitative in-depth interviews explored caregivers perceptions, decision-making, and healthcare barriers to pneumonia management. Quantitative data were analysed using logistic regression, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed using the Three Delays Model. Suspected under-five pneumonia cases caregivers and families were actively engaged in this formative phase to inform Phase II implementation strategies of broader IR, ensuring community-driven and contextually relevant strategies.

ResultsAmong 231 suspected pneumonia cases, 97% of caregivers sought medical care, but 71% consulted non-RMPs, and only 3.6% visited government facilities. Seeking appropriate care was associated with higher maternal education (AOR 6.5, 95% CI: 2.7, 9.7) and higher wealth index (AOR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.6). Thematic analysis revealed delays due to symptom misinterpretation, reliance on home remedies, financial constraints, gender biases, mistrust in public healthcare services, and logistical barriers.

ConclusionDespite high care-seeking rates, provider preferences, socio-cultural factors, and systemic barriers delay appropriate pneumonia treatment. Addressing these challenges requires improving awareness, enhancing public healthcare trust, and strengthening frontline health worker engagement. This study underscores the role of structured beneficiary involvement in refining pneumonia management strategies to ensure sustainable, community-driven interventions.

**Abstract:**
Psychedelics have garnered great attention in recent years as treatments for major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression due to their ability to alter consciousness and afflicted cognitive processes with lasting effects. Given these unique characteristics and the urgent need for efficacious treatments, psychedelics are being tested for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite promising results and growing interest, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics remain uncharacterized. Using a scoping review approach, we summarize current clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov that utilize classic psychedelics as interventions for SUDs with the goal of understanding the current state and outlook of the field. A second scoping review was conducted using PubMed and SCOPUS databases to identify the relevant publications addressing the pharmacotherapeutic potential of restoring dopamine homeostasis as a novel neurobiological mechanism of psychedelics. This mechanism may blunt drug-seeking behavior, promote drug abstinence, and underlie their clinical relevance for SUD in addition to previously characterized mechanisms.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundThe World Health Organization recommends perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), generally using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to children at high risk of severe P. falciparum malaria. Currently, PMC is given up to age two in perennial transmission settings. However, no recommendation exists for perennial settings with seasonal variation in transmission intensity, recently categorized as  sub-perennial. Tailored chemoprevention strategies are needed to protect children during seasons and ages of highest malaria risk. The seasonal dimension must adequately cover seasonally increased risk periods, alongside interventions that address year-round, lower intensity transmission. We propose a hybrid malaria chemoprevention (HMC) strategy, integrating two delivery components: 1) existing PMC, and 2) additional monthly SP doses during the higher-risk rainy season, ensuring a one-month gap between any two doses.

MethodsUsing a validated individual-based malaria model combined with pharmacological models of drug action (OpenMalaria), we examined the potential public health impact of the proposed HMC (for children 03-24 months), and an age-expanded HMC (referred to as HMC+, for children 03-36 months), under different drug sensitivity, coverage, and prevalence (5-70%) assumptions.

ResultsHMC and HMC+ demonstrated a median (interquartile range) of 2.1 (1.6-2.6), 2.9 (2.2-3.6) times higher efficacy (relative fold increase in burden averted) compared to only PMC against clinical, and 2.0 (0.6-3.4), 3.3 (0.8-5.8) against severe cases, respectively, in children under age three. This led to a median protective efficacy of 31.8% (25.4-38.2%), 44.9% (36.9-52.9%) against clinical, and 16.1% (7.0-25.2%), 26.4% (14.4-38.4%) against severe cases by HMC and HMC+ respectively, across the prevalence, drug sensitivity, and coverage assumptions. We found positive net impact for children under age five years, outweighing a limited potential of delayed malaria across settings.

ConclusionSubstantially increased public health benefits might be achieved by adding seasonally-targeted chemoprevention to current PMC in sub-perennial malaria transmission settings. Effectiveness-implementation studies should generate empirical evidence of public health impact including on the disease burden averted, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the hybrid approach. Such studies should also explore determinants of implementation success including operational feasibility, and acceptability of proposed dosing strategies which will facilitate deployment decisions.

**Abstract:**
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes significant morbidity, mortality, and growthth faltering among children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. While gut inflammation contributes to growth faltering, the role of ETEC in inflammation remains poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that ETEC-producing heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxins (ST) induced significant inflammation in humans, but LT-only strains are understudied. In this study, we evaluated the intestinal inflammation induced by the LT-only ETEC strain LSN03-016011/A in a human challenge model. Stool samples were analyzed for pre- and post-challenge myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines, ETEC shedding, and ETEC-specific antibody responses. MPO, IL-1{beta}, and IL-8 levels significantly increased post-ETEC challenge, but there was no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Participants protected from severe diarrhea had higher levels of pre-challenge IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-{gamma} compared to those not protected. The MPO and specific cytokine levels were significantly correlated with the seroconversion status to LT and the colonization factor antigen CS17. This study provides evidence that LT-ETEC strain can induce significant intestinal inflammation even in the absence of symptoms, highlighting the need for a vaccine and a better understanding of the impact of ETEC-attributable inflammation on child health in endemic areas.

Author summaryEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of enteric infections, resulting in diarrhea, malnutrition, and other long-term health effects. However, how ETEC - particularly strains that produce only the heat-labile toxin (LT) - can contribute to gut inflammation is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the impact of an LT-ETEC infection on gut inflammation and its relations to ETEC-specific immune responses using samples from participants in a controlled human infection study. We found that LT-ETEC induces a significant level of gut inflammation marker myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1{beta}, when the patients had moderate to severe diarrhea and even when diarrheal symptoms were mild or absent. Gut inflammation level correlated with immune responses to ETEC. These findings suggest that LT-ETEC infection causes significant gut inflammation, which plays a role in immune responses. Our results highlight the need for preventive strategies to reduce the burden of ETEC-related illness, particularly in regions where these infections are common, to prevent broader adverse consequences for gut health and child development.

**Abstract:**
Similarities between mental symptoms in Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and those in Post-COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PCVS) have been observed. Based on a representative survey of the population aged 18 to 69 years in Germany (n = 4,628), the epidemiologies of both PCS and PCVS were studied. Mental symptoms of PCS (fatigue/exhaustion/weakness, reduced performance, concentration and memory problems, sleep disorders and depressed mood) were reported by 12.1% and mental symptoms of PCVS were reported by 12.6% of all respondents. Concerning PCS, mental symptoms were reported more often by females compared to males (13.5% versus 10.7%), whereas no gender differences were found for PCVS. With the increasing number of booster vaccinations, mental PCVS decreased from 20.8% with one vaccination to 8.9% with four or more vaccinations. Overall, non-mRNA vaccines did not lead significantly to more mental symptoms than mRNA vaccines (12.9% versus 12.5%) but did differ concerning mental symptom patterns: concentration and memory problems (8.2% versus 3.3%), impaired performance (5.7% versus 4.2%) and sleep disorders (6.6% versus 3.2%) were reported more frequently in non-mRNA vaccines. The reported rate of mental PCVS being 12.6% is clearly higher than the 0.5% recorded by official documentation systems (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI)), suggesting a major underreporting. The data indicate that mental symptoms occurring in both PCS and PCVS are common, making the differential diagnosis between PCS and PCVS, as well as between both PCS and PCVS and independent mental disorders such as depressive disorders, an important but challenging task.

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Infectious diseases, also known as communicable disease or transmissible disease is illness that is caused due to pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. One of such infection is caused by zoonotic virus (bat-borne) known as Nipah virus (NiV). NiV is one of the worlds deadliest viruses leading to highest mortality rates. It is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to category C priority pathogen that belongs to genus Hepanivirus, and family Paramyxoviridae. The first occurrence of NiV was observed in Malaysia-Singapore during 1998-1999 and the most recent outbreak in Kozhikode district of Kerala in 2018.

Currently, no drugs or vaccines specific to NiV have proven to yield effective outcome at advanced stage of the disease. However, some therapies involving antiviral drug like Ribavirin along with other medicines have shown to recover patients, reducing the death rate by 36%. Due to extensive research various therapeutic strategies have been proven to successfully target the viral infection during the early stages in animal models. Several vaccines have been under investigation and clinical trials serving as a promising approach towards effective and safe vaccine in both livestock animals and humans.

This study underscores the essential contributions shaping the academic discourse in nipah virus research, bringing to light the most influential studies within the co-citation and co-occurrence network analysis. By identifying the keywords, we gain valuable insights into the foundational research driving advancements in this research area. The detailed mapping of the co-citation network further illuminates the interconnectedness of various research themes and the collaborative efforts that boost the field of nipah virus research in different horizons. The recognition of influential studies not only highlights the depth and breadth of scholarly engagement but also provides a roadmap for future research endeavours.

Methods We estimated antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococcal sinusitis and non-bacteremic pneumonia incidence as products of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates, serotype distribution, and serotype-specific antimicrobial nonsusceptibility prevalences by antibiotic class and guideline-recommended agents from 2016-2019. We derived pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates from national healthcare utilization surveys and administrative datasets; pneumococcal-attributable attributable percents and serotype distributions from published data; and serotype-specific nonsusceptibility estimates from Active Bacterial Core surveillance data. We evaluated nonsusceptibility for all serotypes and those targeted by 15-, 20- and 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15/20/21). Results An estimated 16.4% (95% confidence interval 12.8-21.4%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 19.0% (14.8-24.9%) of sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes, translating to 243,521 (179,673-333,675) and 1,844,726 (1,070,763-2,904,089) outpatient visits for pneumonia and sinusitis, respectively, and 10,155 (7,542-13,803) pneumonia hospitalizations annually. An estimated 31.2% (26.6-36.3%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 10.5% (9.4-12.0%) of pneumococcal sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]1 outpatient first-line antibiotic agent. Cases attributable to serotypes targeted by PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21 that were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes accounted for 7.4% (4.7-11.1%), 8.5% (5.8-12.1%), and 12.6% (9.2-17.5%) of all non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia cases, and 8.4% (5.3-12.5%), 9.4% (6.2-13.4), and 14.4% (10.4-20.0%) of all pneumococcal sinusitis cases. Conclusions We demonstrated high proportions of antibiotic nonsusceptibility in non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis in US adults. PCVs and antibiotic stewardship may mitigate antibiotic nonsusceptibility in pneumococcal disease.

**Abstract:**
Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a promising non-invasive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), though significant variability exists in patient responses. This quadruple-blind, sham-controlled crossover randomized clinical trial investigated whether clinical improvement was influenced by the spatial selection of stimulation sites or early cardiac rhythm modulations. Seventy-five MDD patients (33 women) were randomized to either personalized stimulation sites, identified via the strongest negative functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the default mode network (DMN), or fixed stimulation at the F3 position of the 10-20 EEG system. Electrocardiograms throughout stimulation monitored heart rate and its variability, focusing on heartbeat deceleration (RR slope) and changes in the root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats (RMSSD). Findings demonstrated that a higher RR slope within the first 45 seconds of stimulation predicted greater clinical improvement at six weeks, while a lower RMSSD change during the first 270 seconds correlated with improvement at one week. However, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between personalized and fixed stimulation sites. This study identified a significant relationship between early heart rhythm modulations and the antidepressant effects of accelerated iTBS in MDD. Although the spatial determination of stimulation sites did not enhance clinical improvement, iTBS-induced changes in cardiac rhythm during early sessions may develop into valuable biomarkers for stratifying patients, enabling more personalized and effective treatment strategies in the future.

**Abstract:**
In 2024, the Americas region experienced the largest dengue outbreak on record and Brazil was among the worst affected countries, reporting 6.6 million cases and 6,200 deaths. We report the long-term entomological and epidemiological effectiveness of city-wide deployment of wMel-strain Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti in Niteroi, a city of half a million people in Rio de Janeiro state, where Wolbachia releases across 70% of the urban population in 2017-2019 were expanded to remaining populated areas in 2023. wMel was durably established at [&ge;]95% prevalence in Ae. aegypti populations throughout Niteroi four years post-release, and up to seven years in the earliest release sites. This city-wide Wolbachia coverage provided sustained population-level protection against dengue throughout the five years post-intervention, including during the 2024 epidemic surge, averting an estimated three-quarters of the dengue case burden that would otherwise have been expected in Niteroi in 2024.

**Abstract:**
Background: Patients with rare cancers face substantial challenges due to limited evidence-based treatment options, resulting from sparse clinical trials. Advances in large language models (LLMs) and recommendation algorithms offer new opportunities to utilize all clinical trial information to improve clinical decisions. Methods: We used LLM to systematically extract and standardize more than 100,000 cancer trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Each trial was annotated using a customized scoring system reflecting cancer-treatment interactions based on clinical outcomes and trial attributes. Using this structured data set, we implemented three state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend potentially effective treatments across different cancer types. Results: The LLM-driven data extraction process successfully generated a comprehensive and rigorously curated database from fragmented clinical trial information, covering 78 cancer types and 5,315 distinct interventions. Recommendation models demonstrated high predictive accuracy (cross-validated RMSE: {0.49--0.62}) and identified clinically meaningful new treatments for melanoma, independently validated by oncology experts. Conclusions: Our study establishes a proof of concept demonstrating that the combination of LLMs with sophisticated recommendation algorithms can systematically identify novel and clinically plausible cancer treatments. This integrated approach may accelerate the identification of effective therapies for rare cancers, ultimately improving patient outcomes by generating evidence-based treatment recommendations where traditional data sources remain limited.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: Though dementia is a serious illness that progresses over many years, little is known about the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Objective: To test the impact of a virtual, nurse-led primary palliative care intervention on older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Methods: This randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed to compare the impact of {usual care} to {usual care plus a virtual, nurse-led, primary palliative care intervention} on community- dwelling, chronically ill older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Results: We hypothesize that patients in the virtual nurse intervention arm will have their primary palliative care needs identified and fulfilled compared to those in the usual care arm. Conclusions: Identification of the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of and/or with MCI, mild or moderate dementia will help refine intervention to effectively provide primary palliative care in a timely manner to these patients.

**Abstract:**
Introduction. HIV testing and treatment coverage among men in Zambia remains suboptimal, partly due to lower healthcare-seeking behavior compared to women. To address this gap, Circle of Hope (CoH), a local faith-based organization funded by the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), developed the community post (CP) model. CPs are staffed by multi-disciplinary teams that provide HIV-testing, anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) testing. This analysis assesses the impact of these CPs on HIV case finding, ART initiation, and VL suppression among men. Methods. Routine program data reported to PEPFAR by CoH Zambia were analyzed for two periods: pre-COVID 19 (April 2018-March 2020) and during the pandemic (April 2020-March 2022). Indicators included the number of HIV tests conducted and positive results received (overall and for index testing specifically), ART initiation among men living with HIV (MLHIV), 12-month retention on ART, and the proportion of clients with VL suppression (<1000 copies/mL). Results. Between April 2018 and March 2022, the number of CPs expanded from 9 to 38 across Zambia. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, men continued to represent a substantial share of clients: 49.5% to 41.4% of those tested, 38.5% to 42.0% of those diagnosed (p<0.001), and 38.9% to 43.3% of those initiated on ART (p<0.001). The number of men on ART rose from 3,320 (38%) to 13,580 (43%, p<0.000001). Retention and VL suppression among men also remained high, increasing slightly from 94% to 97% and 95% to 96%, respectively. Over 6,000 men were diagnosed through index testing services, with percent positivity consistently high, ranging from 54.4% to 61.1% (p<0.001). Conclusions. The CoH model was successful at identifying and linking MLHIV to HIV treatment services and assisting them to achieve and maintain viral suppression even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding this community-based model may help close HIV testing and treatment gaps among men and advance HIV epidemic control in Zambia and beyond.

**Abstract:**
Background There is a need for person-centred outcome measures (PCOMs) in tuberculosis (TB) clinical trials to capture the priorities of affected individuals relating to both disease and treatment, alongside the traditional efficacy and safety analysis. Methods We conducted a literature search to identify existing health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) measurement tools and instances where they have been used to evaluate TB disease in interventional studies. DR-TB survivors were recruited for focus group discussions in South Africa, Mongolia and Georgia to determine the most important aspects of disease and treatment experience from their perspective. A second round of focus groups then worked to prioritise these items and group them within different domains. A panel of researchers and academic clinicians evaluated existing PCOMs identified in the literature search using a published framework. Finally, an assessment was carried out by a experienced TB Community Advisory Group members for appropriateness and acceptability, and clinical trial site investigators for feasibility of the PCOMs. Results The initial round of 9 focus groups involving 57 participants identified priority items grouped under the fields overall quality of life, disease symptoms, and treatment and side effects. In the second round of four focus groups involving 26 participants, the highest ranked items under overall quality of life were duration of treatment, experience of swallowing pills, and how long before being able to contribute to the household. The most important symptoms were coughing, weight loss and breathlessness. The highest ranked side effects were nausea/vomiting, skin colour changes, and nerve problems. FACIT-TB was the only measurement tool assessed that was rated good for appropriateness, and excellent, good or fair in all other fields by community representatives, researchers and clinical trial site staff. Conclusions The FACIT-TB measurement tool was identified as the most appropriate disease-specific PCOM currently available for use in clinical trials investigating novel DR-TB therapeutics.

**Abstract:**
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) 2024 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment guidelines expand eligibility for nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment in individuals with chronic HBV infection. For countries to implement these guidelines, there is a critical need to understand the population who are treatment eligible. While HBV drug resistance (HBVDR) is uncommon, monitoring for any potential resistance is a relevant public health consideration. Methods: We studied a population in rural Uganda to describe the proportion of individuals eligible for treatment based on the 2024 WHO treatment guidelines. We determined how this proportion varies according to the eligibility criteria used, comparing the performance of different assessment tools. We calculated Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet Ratio Index; APRI, Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase-to-Platelet Ratio; GPR and transient elastography; TE and performed HBV sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology to determine the prevalence of HBVDR in treatment naive and treatment experienced individuals. Results: In this cohort, 24/63 (38%) individuals with CHB were eligible for treatment. This fell to 14/63 (22%) in a hypothetical scenario where TE was not available for the assessment of liver fibrosis. We demonstrate a lack of concordance between non-invasive tests (NIT) of liver disease in treatment-naive HBV mono-infected individuals. An APRI cut-off of 0.5 had a sensitivity of 23.0% for predicting a TE score of >7 kPa (F2 fibrosis). Sensitivity for detecting F2 fibrosis was increased to 38.5% using an APRI cut off of 0.36, and to 46.2% using the GPR. We did not identify any HBVDR in the HBV mono-infected treatment-naive population (n=58). 24/210 individuals were living with HIV/HBV coinfection; HBV was sequenced in 5 of these of whom 2 had genomic evidence of nucleos(t)ide analogue resistance (rt180M/204V). Conclusions: While the WHO 2024 treatment criteria offer an opportunity to expand access to care, there is a need to determine how assessment tools differ in determination of eligibility in different settings. HBVDR remains uncommon but more research is needed to understand its prevalence and clinical impact in African populations.

**Abstract:**
While widely used to study vaccine effectiveness, test negative designs (TND) also provide a platform for identifying and quantifying immunological correlates of protection against disease. A key component of such studies is the protection function, the mathematical relationship between the value of an immunological assay and the relative risk of disease. This function is often estimated using logistic regression, comparing the odds of disease at a given assay value to the odds at assay value zero. Here, we show through mathematical analysis and simulation experiments that logistic regression, while common, fundamentally constrains the functional forms of protection that can be inferred from data in TNDs, potentially leading to overly simplistic estimates of the protection function. To address this limitation, we adapt and analyze a scaled logit model, originally developed for case-control data, as a flexible alternative that allows for greater flexibility in estimating protection functions from TND data. We demonstrate that this approach improves accuracy across a range of biologically plausible protection functions, highlight conditions under which it may fail, and provide practical guidance for researchers to adopt it as a new standard for TND studies evaluating correlates of protection.

**Abstract:**
The growing interconnection between human, animal, and environmental health has escalated the need for integrated approaches to public health. The One Health framework addresses this necessity by promoting local, national, and global interdisciplinary collaboration. Population growth, intensive animal farming, and manmade environmental changes contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases of probable animal origin, such as COVID-19. Establishing the Quadripartite collaboration with four multilateral United Nations agencies underscores the increasing recognition of these interdependencies. This scoping review protocol aims to evaluate how One Health studies integrate human, animal, and environmental health, analyzing methodologies, scope, and interdisciplinary collaboration, to identify key achievements, existing gaps, and future research priorities. The projected literature search will include PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Virtual Health Library, Health Systems Evidence, and Social Systems Evidence. Additionally, grey literature will be retrieved from Opengrey, Thesis Commons, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations, by structured electronic search, as well as the first 100 entries in Google Scholar, manually. This protocol proposes to include studies, policies, regulations, strategies, and interventions published from 2004 onwards aimed at the prevention and integrated management of food safety, zoonotic diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and the impacts of climate change on health. No language filters will be applied. Two independent reviewers will analyze titles, abstracts, and full texts to conduct a two-phase review, with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. Data will be retrieved using a standardized data extraction form, and results will be presented in graphic and tabular format, accompanied by a narrative summary, to highlight the achievements of integrated One Health implementation. The expected result is the development of a scoping review protocol to map One Health studies and practices, which effectively integrate the human, animal, and environmental health dimensions applicable globally in public health scenarios.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: University students frequently experience challenges that affect their sleep quality, including academic stress, lifestyle habits, and socio-demographic factors. Common sleep disturbances, such as delayed sleep onset and poor sleep efficiency, often result in daytime dysfunction and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm. Methods: This cross-sectional study appraised sleep quality among undergraduate students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 530 undergraduate students were purposively selected from three public universities. Participants were chosen through convenience sampling, with students who had contracted COVID-19 during the study excluded from the sample. Results: The mean age of the university students was 21.1 (2.0) years. Regarding PSQI components, the participants showed moderate sleep latency (55.7%) and habitual sleep efficiency (56.0%), with mild levels of sleep disturbances at night (68.1%), daytime dysfunction (51.1%), and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm (48.5%). The global PSQI scores were poor for 59.4% of participants, while 40.6% had good scores, with a mean of 6.5(2.9). Among the students, 44.9% reported fair subjective sleep quality, followed by good (24.7%), very good (18.1%), and poor (12.3%) sleep quality. Lifestyle factors such as class attendance, online media usage, BMI, physical exercise, tea/coffee consumption, and smoking were significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Sleep quality factors like daytime sleep duration, nighttime sleep latency, and sleeping pill usage were also significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Significant associations were found between sleep quality and factors such as age, household income, daily study hours, BMI, daytime sleep, and sleep latency (p<0.05). Conclusion: The study revealed that longer sleep latency, daytime sleep, and sleeping pill usage were related with poorer sleep quality. It also emphasized that sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm were significant predictors of sleep quality.

**Abstract:**
Social isolation is a growing public health concern, particularly among cancer survivors who face persistent challenges in maintaining social connections following treatment. While its impact on mental health is increasingly recognized, the underlying pathways and contextual differences across rural and urban settings remain underexplored. This study aimed to identify the psychosocial and personal factors that contribute to perceived social isolation among U.S. cancer survivors and to assess how isolation mediates the relationship between these factors and mental health. We also examined whether these associations differ between rural and urban populations. Data were drawn from the 2022 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 6), with a subsample of cancer survivors (n = 926). A conceptual framework was developed using constructs from the Biopsychosocial Model, the Stress Process Model, the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, and the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to evaluate the relationships among personal factors (age, BMI, time since diagnosis, inability of self-care), psychosocial perceptions (perceived care quality, cancer information comprehension, negative life perception), social isolation, and mental health (PHQ-4). Multigroup analysis compared rural and urban survivors. Social isolation was a strong predictor of mental health, with key antecedents including cancer information access, inability of self-care, time since diagnosis, negative life perception, and perception of care quality. Several pathways varied by geography; for instance, the effects of self-care difficulty and care perception on isolation and mental health were significant only in urban settings. This study highlights the central role of social isolation in shaping mental health outcomes among cancer survivors and underscores the importance of targeted, context-sensitive interventions to reduce isolation and promote psychosocial well-being, particularly in underserved rural communities.

**Abstract:**
Background: Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumors frequently diagnosed in pediatric and young adult patients. These tumors respond poorly to conventional immunotherapy, though the precise reason for this is not known. We sought to characterize the systemic immune response to sarcomas by measuring the levels of circulating cytokines in the plasma of sarcoma patients, testing the hypothesis that the natures of a patient's immune response to their tumor directly affects outcome. Methods: Plasma was collected from newly diagnosed, treatment-naive pediatric sarcoma patients participating in an ongoing clinical trial, MCC20320. A panel of 18 cytokines was selected and cytokine levels were measured using the Luminex platform. Cytokine levels were analyzed based on clinicopathological parameters such as gender, age, stage, and survival. Results: We found that the cytokine profile in patients newly diagnosed with sarcoma is distinct from healthy controls, but different sarcomas were not distinguishable. Patients with osteosarcoma who had elevated levels of multiple cytokines had inferior overall survival compared to those with fewer or no elevated levels. Similarly, elevated levels of individual cytokines and chemokines, including IL-24, CXCL5, and CXCL10, were associated with inferior event-free or overall survival in patients with osteosarcoma. Perhaps most significantly, elevated IL-1B; at diagnosis was associated with metastatic presentation and inferior event-free survival in patients with osteosarcoma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that pediatric sarcoma patients mount a systemic immune response that may affect event-free or overall survival. IL-1B; in particular may be a valuable target for immunotherapy for osteosarcoma patients.

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Abstract:**
Background: The growing availability of large genomic datasets presents an opportunity to discover new metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions useful for industrial or synthetic biological applications. Efforts to identify new enzyme functions in this huge number of sequences cannot be achieved without the help of bioinformatics tools and the development of new strategies. Standard methods for assigning a biological function to a gene are based on sequence similarity. However, another way is to mine databases to identify conserved gene clusters (i.e. syntenies). Indeed in prokaryotic genomes, genes involved in the same pathway are frequently encoded in a single locus with an operonic organisation. This Genomic Context (GC) conservation is considered as a reliable indicator of functional relationships, and thus is a promising approach to improve the gene function prediction. Methods. Here we present NetSyn (Network Synteny), a tool which aims to cluster protein sequences according to the similarity of their genomic context rather than their sequence similarity. Starting from a set of protein sequences of interest, NetSyn retrieves neighbouring genes from the corresponding genomes as well as their protein sequences. Homologous protein families are then computed to measure GC conservation between each pair of input sequences using a GC conservation score. A network is created where nodes represent the input proteins and edges the fact that two proteins share a common GC. The weight of the edges corresponds to the synteny conservation score. The network is then partitioned into clusters of proteins sharing a high degree of synteny conservation. Results. As a proof of concept, we used NetSyn on two different datasets. The first one is made of homologous sequences of an enzyme family (the BKACE family, previously named DUF849) to divide it into sub-families of specific activities. NetSyn was able to go a step further by providing additional subfamilies to those already published. The second dataset corresponds to a set of non-homologous proteins consisting of different Glycosyl Hydrolases (GH) with the aim of interconnecting them and finding conserved operon-like genomic structures. NetSyn was able to find a locus composed of 3 non homologous glycosyl hydrolases, involved in the degradation of xyloglucan, in 162 genomes. Discussion. NetSyn is able to cluster proteins according to their genomic context, making it possible to establish functional links between proteins without considering their sequence similarity alone. We showed that NetSyn is efficient in exploring large protein families to define iso-functional groups. It can also highlight functional interactions between proteins from different families and predicts new conserved genomic structures that have not yet been experimentally characterised. NetSyn can also be useful for pinpointing annotation errors that have been propagated across databases, and for suggesting annotations on proteins currently annotated as "unknown". NetSyn is freely available at https://github.com/labgem/netsyn.

**Abstract:**
The locus coeruleus (LC), the major source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is among the earliest site of pathology in both Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD), and it undergoes catastrophic degeneration later in both disorders. Dysregulation of the LC is thought to contribute to prodromal symptoms of AD and PD such as anxiety and sleep disturbances, while frank LC loss promotes cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms responsible for its selective vulnerability are unknown. It has been suggested that neuromelanin (NM) pigment contributes to LC susceptibility, but causal relationships have been difficult to test because rodents do not naturally produce NM. Here, we report that viral-mediated expression of human tyrosinase induced pigmentation in mouse LC neurons that recapitulated key features of natural primate NM. One week of NM accumulation resulted in LC neuron hyperactivity, reduced tissue NE levels, transcriptional changes, and anxiety-like behavior. By 6-10 weeks, NM accumulation was associated with severe LC neuron neurodegeneration and microglial engulfment of the pigment granules, while the anxiety-like behavior abated. These phenotypes are reminiscent of LC dysfunction and cell death in AD and PD, validating this model for studying the consequences of NM accumulation in the LC as it relates to neurodegenerative disease.

Significance StatementAlzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) are two of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Because therapies that cure or even prevent their progression are lacking, research is focused on the identifying earliest signs of disease as targets for diagnosis and treatment. The locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of the neurotransmitter n norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is one of the first brain regions affected in both AD and PD. LC dysregulation promotes prodromal AD and PD symptoms, while its degeneration accelerates disease progression. Here we identify neuromelanin (NM) pigment as a LC vulnerability factor that induces neuronal hyperactivity followed by cell death. Approaches that mitigate NM accumulation and toxicity may target the earliest phases of neurodegenerative disease.

**Abstract:**
Brain pericytes maintain the blood-brain barrier (BBB), secrete neurotrophic factors and clear toxic proteins. Their loss in neurological disorders leads to BBB breakdown, neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Therefore, cell therapy to replace lost pericytes holds potential to restore impaired cerebrovascular and brain functions. However, the molecular composition and function of human iPSC-derived brain pericytes (iPSC-PC) remains poorly characterized. Here, we show by a quantitative analysis of 8,344 proteins and 20,572 phosphopeptides that iPSC-PC share 96% of total proteins and 98% of protein phosphorylation sites with primary human brain pericytes. This includes cell adhesion and tight junction proteins, transcription factors, and different protein kinase families of the human kinome. In pericyte-deficient mice, iPSC-PC home to host brain capillaries to form hybrid human-mouse microvessels with ligand-receptor associations. They repair BBB leaks and protect against neuron loss, which we show requires PDGRFB and pleiotrophin. They also clear Alzheimer's amyloid-beta; and tau neurotoxins via lipoprotein receptor. Thus, iPSC-PC may have potential as a replacement therapy for pericyte-deficient neurological disorders.

**Abstract:**
Disease phenotypes can be described as the consequence of interactions among molecular processes that are altered beyond resilience. Here, we address the challenge of assessing the possible alteration of intra- and inter-cellular molecular interactions among gene sets, which are intended to represent processes and or cellular phenotypes. We present an approach, designated as "Ulisse", which complements the existing methods of enrichment analysis and cell-cell communication analysis. It can be applied to a gene list as well as multiple ranked gene lists, typically derived in the context of omics or multi-omics studies. The approach highlights the presence of alterations in those components that control the interactions between processes or cells. Crosstalk quantification is supported by two null models. Further, the approach provides an additional way of identifying the genes associated with the phenotype. As a proof-of-concept, we applied Ulisse to study the alteration of pathway crosstalks and cell-cell communications in triple negative breast cancer samples, based on single-cell RNA sequencing. In conclusion, our work supports the usefulness of crosstalk analysis as an additional instrument in the "toolkit" of biomedical research for translating complex biological data into actionable insights.

**Abstract:**
In the human brain, the alpha rhythm in occipital cortex and the mu rhythm in sensorimotor cortex are among the most prominent rhythms, with both rhythms functionally implicated in gating modality-specific information. Separation of these rhythms is non-trivial due to the spatial mixing of these oscillations in sensor space. Using a computationally efficient processing pipeline requiring no manual data cleaning, we isolated alpha and/or mu rhythms from electroencephalography recordings performed on 1605 children aged 5-18. Using the extracted time series for each rhythm, we characterized the waveform shape on a cycle-by-cycle basis and examined whether and how the waveform shape differs across development. We demonstrate that alpha and mu rhythms both exhibit nonsinusoidal waveform shape that changes significantly across development, in addition to the known large changes in oscillatory frequency. This dataset also provided an opportunity to assess oscillatory measures for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found no differences in the resting-state features of these alpha-band rhythms for either ADHD or ASD in comparison to typically developing participants in this dataset. While waveform shape is ignored by traditional Fourier spectral analyses, these nonsinusoidal properties may be informative for building more constrained generative models for different types of alpha-band rhythms, yielding more specific insight into their generation.

**Abstract:**
Perceptual decision-making is the process by which an animal uses sensory stimuli to choose an action or mental proposition. This process is thought to be mediated by neurons organized as attractor networks1,2. However, whether attractor dynamics underlie decision behavior and the complex neuronal responses remains unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings from hundreds of neurons, together with an unsupervised, deep learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in frontal cortex and striatum of rats while the subjects accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes, the first dominated by sensory inputs, and the second dominated by the autonomous dynamics, with flow in a direction (i.e., "neural mode") largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that the transition to the second regime corresponds to the moment of decision commitment. We developed a simplified model that approximates the coupled transition in dynamics and neural mode and allows precise inference, from each trials large-scale neural population activity, of a putative neurally-inferred time of commitment ("nTc") on that trial. The simplified model captures diverse and complex single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping3-5, as well as trial-averaged curved trajectories6-8, and reveals distinctions between brain regions. The estimated nTc times were not time-locked to stimulus onset or offset, or to response onset, but were instead broadly distributed across trials. If nTc marks the moment of decision commitment, sensory evidence before nTc should affect the decision, while evidence afterward should not. Behavioral analysis of trials aligned to their estimated nTc times confirmed this prediction. Our results show that the formation of a perceptual choice involves a rapid, coordinated transition in both the dynamical regime and the neural mode of the decision process that corresponds to commitment to a decision, and suggest this moment as a useful entry point for dissecting mechanisms underlying rapid changes in internal state.

**Abstract:**
Microbes exhibit precise control over their composition and geometry in order to adapt and grow in diverse environments. However, the mechanisms that orchestrate this simultaneous regulation, and how they are causally linked, remains poorly understood. In this work, we derive and experimentally test a biophysical model of cell size regulation in Escherichia coli which relates the cellular surface-to-volume ratio to the total macromolecular composition and partitioning of the proteome between cellular compartments. Central to this model is the observation that the macromolecular density of the cytoplasm and the protein density within the cell membranes are maintained at a constant ratio across growth conditions. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, single-cell microscopy, and biochemical assays, we show this model quantitatively predicts a non-linear relationship between the surface-to-volume ratio, proteome localization, and the total ribosome content of the cell. This model holds under perturbations of intracellular ppGpp concentrations-thereby changing the ribosomal content-demonstrating that cellular geometry is not strictly determined by the cellular growth rate. These findings provide a biophysical link between the coregulation of proteome organization and cellular geometry, offering a quantitative framework for understanding bacterial size regulation across conditions.

## Modeling the growth of cytosolic TDP-43 inclusion bodies and accumulated neurotoxicity of misfolded oligomers in neurons

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a mathematical model for the growth of transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) inclusion bodies in neuron soma. The parameter representing accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers is also introduced. The models equations allow for the numerical calculation of the concentrations of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, as well as free TDP-43 oligomers and those deposited into inclusion bodies. By simulating the deposition of free oligomers into inclusion bodies, the model predicts the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies. An approximate solution to the model equations is derived for the scenario where protein degradation machinery is dysfunctional, leading to infinite half-lives for TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and both free and deposited oligomers. This solution, valid for large times, predicts that the inclusion body radius increases proportionately to the cube root of time, while accumulated neurotoxicity increases linearly with time. To the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to model the relationship between the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies and time, as well as the first to introduce the concept of accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers. The sensitivity analysis of the approximate solution indicates that the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity are independent of the kinetic constants at large timescales. While the numerical solution of the full mathematical model continues to work with finite half-lives, the approximate solution becomes invalid for scenarios with physiologically relevant (finite) half-lives of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and free misfolded oligomers. In contrast to the scenario with infinite half-lives, the numerical solution reveals that for different values of the kinetic constants, the curves representing the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity converge to distinct curves as time progresses.

**Abstract:**
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is typically treated empirically with vancomycin, with therapy later tailored based on susceptibility results. However, these tests occur before vancomycin exposure and do not account for adaptation during empiric treatment that can alter S. aureus susceptibility to first-line drugs. To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU, impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes. Our findings suggest a probabilistic approach to antimicrobial therapy, advocating for rapid genomic diagnostics alongside susceptibility testing to better anticipate and respond to evolutionary changes.

SignificanceAntibiotic treatment can influence bacterial evolution, altering the effectiveness of subsequent therapies by inducing collateral resistance or sensitivity. This study reveals that evolution toward vancomycin-intermediate resistance in the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus proceeds through at least two distinct evolutionary pathways: one characterized by alterations in cell wall metabolism and another by changes in global stress response. These adaptive trajectories result in contrasting collateral sensitivities to first-line antibiotics. By introducing the Collateral Response Score, we assess the uncertainty in these outcomes, providing a probabilistic framework to evaluate how past antibiotic exposure shapes future treatment responses. Further validation studies are needed; however, we believe that improved forecasting of pathogen evolution can enhance antibiotic stewardship, inform therapeutic decisions, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

**Abstract:**
Recent studies have established a reciprocal causal link between aging and the activation of transposable elements, characterized in particular by a de-repression of LINE-1 retrotransposons. These LINE-1 elements represent 21% of the human genome, but only a minority of these sequences retain the coding potential essential for their mobility. LINE-1 encoded proteins can induce cell toxicity implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, our knowledge of the expression and localization of LINE-1-encoded proteins in the central nervous system is limited. Using a novel approach combining atlas-based brain mapping with deep-learning algorithms on large-scale pyramidal brain images, we unveil a heterogeneous, neuron-predominant and widespread ORF1p expression throughout the murine brain at steady-state. In aged mice, ORF1p expression increases significantly which is corroborated in human post-mortem dopaminergic neurons by an increase in young LINE-1 elements including those with open reading frames. Mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous mouse ORF1p revealed novel, neuron-specific protein interactors. These findings contribute to a comprehensive description of the dynamics of LINE-1 and ORF1p expression in the brain at steady-state and in aging and provide insights on ORF1p protein interactions in the brain.

**Abstract:**
Proteobacterial methanotrophs are dependent on the oxidation of methane for ATP production and assimilation of carbon into biomass. Interestingly, some types of gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs thrive in oxygen-depleted zones of lakes and other aquatic ecosystems despite their reliance on oxygen to support methane oxidation. The model gammaproteobacterial methanotroph, Methylomonas denitrificans FJG1, oxidizes methane coupled to nitrate reduction under hypoxia and highly upregulates its expression of bacteriohemerythrin (Bhr). Bhr is a homolog of eukaryotic hemerythrin, which is a protein associated with oxygen binding. Ten bhr homologs were identified in the genome of M. denitrificans FJG1, requiring phylogenetic and gene expression analyses to pinpoint which homolog is likely responsible for delivering oxygen to support methane oxidation to under low oxygen conditions. This study examined the prevalence and phylogeny of the 10 bhr homologs from M. denitrificans FJG1 in the genomes of other methanotrophs and across the Bacteria. The homolog denoted "bhr-00" was specific to methanotroph genomes, was highly expressed in M. denitrificans FJG1 under hypoxia, and its predicted structure was nearly identical to a purified oxygen-scavenging hemerythrin protein from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath. Other bhr homologs upregulated from denitrifying cultures of M. denitrificans FJG1 included those with gene neighborhoods related to oxygen sensing, denitrification and chemotaxis. Together, this study uncovered potential multifunctional roles of bacteriohemerythrin genes of M. denitrificans FJG1 under low oxygen conditions and identified the bhr homolog that most likely enables and supports oxygen delivery to methane monooxygenase enzymes in anoxic ecosystems.

**Abstract:**
Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker[-&gt;]Brainstem[-&gt;]Thalamus[-&gt;]Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking activity upon multi-whisker stimulation, resembling the stable response pattern observed in barrels. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions.

**Abstract:**
The Global Pandemic Lineage (GPL) of the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been described as a main driver of amphibian extinctions on nearly every continent. Near complete genome of three Bd-GPL strains have enabled studies of the pathogen but the genomic features that set Bd-GPL apart from other Bd lineages is not well understood due to a lack of high-quality genome assemblies and annotations from other lineages. We used long-read DNA sequencing to assemble high-quality genomes of three Bd-BRAZIL isolates and one non-pathogen outgroup species Polyrhizophydium stewartii (Ps) strain JEL0888, and compared these to genomes of previously sequenced Bd-GPL strains. The Bd-BRAZIL assemblies range in size between 22.0 and 26.1 Mb and encode 8495-8620 protein-coding genes for each strain. Our pan-genome analysis provided insight into shared and lineage-specific gene content. The core genome of Bd consists of 6278 conserved gene families, with 202 Bd-BRAZIL and 172 Bd-GPL specific gene families. We discovered gene copy number variation in pathogenicity gene families between Bd-BRAZIL and Bd-GPL strains though none were consistently expanded in Bd-GPL or Bd-BRAZIL strains. Comparison within the Batrachochytrium genus and two closely related non-pathogenic saprophytic chytrids identified variation in sequence and protein domain counts. We further test these new Bd-BRAZIL genomes to assess their utility as reference genomes for transcriptome alignment and analysis. Our analysis examines the genomic variation between strains in Bd-BRAZIL and Bd-GPL and offers insights into the application of these genomes as reference genomes for future studies.

**Abstract:**
Deep learning-based compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction models are promising in the field of molecular biology, particularly for facilitating the drug discovery process. In practical applications, CPI models should achieve a high generalization performance, quantify prediction confidence, and ensure explainability. Here, we propose ChemGLaM, a chemical genomics language model for reliable and explainable CPI predictions, by addressing these three crucial aspects. ChemGLaM integrates independently pre-trained chemical and protein language models through an interaction block with a cross-attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in predicting novel CPIs. Incorporating uncertainty estimation and attention visualization enables ChemGLaM to enhance the success rate of virtual screening and to provide molecular insights into CPIs. Furthermore, we demonstrate its practical applicability by constructing a public database for large-scale CPI predictions and enabling drug/target exploration for candidate treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ChemGLaM represents a significant step toward overcoming the challenges of AI-driven drug discovery and addressing unmet medical needs.

**Abstract:**
In rodents, estrogens aromatized from androgens in the brain are essential for the development of male-typical behaviors. In many other vertebrates including humans and teleost fish, however, androgens facilitate these behaviors directly via the androgen receptor without aromatization into estrogens. Here we report that mutagenesis-derived male medaka fish lacking Cyp19a1b (a subtype of aromatase predominantly expressed in the brain) exhibit severely impaired male-typical mating and aggression, despite elevated brain androgen levels. These phenotypes can be rescued by estrogen administration, indicating that brain-derived estrogens are pivotal for male-typical behaviors even in teleosts. Our results further suggest that these estrogens facilitate male-typical behaviors by potentiating androgen action in the brain via the direct stimulation of androgen receptor transcription, thereby revealing a previously unappreciated mode of action of brain-derived estrogens. We additionally show that female fish lacking Cyp19a1b are less receptive to male courtship and conversely court other females, highlighting the significance of brain-derived estrogens in establishing sex-typical behaviors in both sexes.

**Abstract:**
The spatial arrangement of microtubules in the cytoskeleton in the cells of protists has been used for decades for taxonomy and phylogenetic inference at various levels. In contrast, the protein composition of non-microtubular structures is mostly unknown. Exceptions are system I fibers in algae, which are built of striated fiber assemblins (SFAs). Interestingly, SFAs are also components of a range of other, dissimilar structures, playing a role in the cortex of ciliates, cell division in apicomplexans, and adhesion of the parasite Giardia to the intestine. In a broad bioinformatic survey, we show the existence of three ancestral eukaryotic paralogues of SFA, and note that they are present in all "typical excavates:" small heterotrophic flagellates bearing a ventral feeding groove. In one representative, Paratrimastix pyriformis, we detected two SFA paralogs using specific antibodies and expansion microscopy. We show that they co-localize selectively with several microtubules and structures attached to the basal body of the posterior flagellum, namely the right microtubular root, B-fiber, C-fiber, and composite fiber. We demonstrate that one of the paralogs self-assembles in vitro into striated filaments which, under negative staining and cryo-electron microscopy, resemble system I fibers as seen in previous studies. Given the facts that all three SFA paralogs appear to be ancestral to most eukaryotic lineages, as is probably the morphology of "typical excavates" with a ventral groove, we speculate that a role in the development or function of the feeding apparatus of the common ancestor of most if not all eukaryotes was the primary function of these proteins.

**Abstract:**
Understanding how the eyes, head, and hands coordinate in natural contexts is a critical challenge in visuomotor coordination research, often constrained by sedentary tasks, cued actions, or restricted settings. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment where participants could self-generate pick-and-place actions on a life-size shelf in a virtual environment, recording concurrent gaze and body movements. Subjects exhibited intricate translation and rotation movements of the eyes, head, and hands during the task. We employed a time-dependent principal component analysis to study the relationship between the movements of the eyes, head, and hands relative to the onset of the action. We reduced the overall dimensionality into 2D representations, capturing up to 65% of the movement variance just in time with the actions. Our analysis revealed a synergistic coupling of the eye-head and eye-hand systems, as well as a strong coupling within the head-hand system. The eyes synchronized with the head and hands close to the action onset, with variations in coupling observed in horizontal and vertical planes, indicating distinct mechanisms for coordination in the brain. Crucially, the head and hands remained tightly coupled throughout the observation period, suggesting a shared neural code driving these effectors. Notably, the low-dimensional representations of the eye-head-hand movement vectors showed maximum predictive accuracy of the actions location ~200ms before the action onset, highlighting just-in-time coordination among the three effectors. Furthermore, the predictive accuracy was significantly influenced by the location of the upcoming action. Our study emphasizes the differential visuomotor control subject to the task structure, providing insights into the dynamic interplay of eye, head, and hand movements during natural behavior.

NEW & NOTEWORTHYStudying natural, self-initiated, complex visuomotor coordination, we observe low-dimensional dynamics with distinct patterns along horizontal and vertical axes. The eyes horizontal movement showed notable independence, aligning with head and hand movements just in time for action. Notably, around critical events, the dimensionality of the complex movements is further reduced, indicating dynamic correspondence of eye-head-hand coordination.

**Abstract:**
Stimulation of specific cell groups under different network regimes (e.g., spontaneous activity or sensory-evoked activity) can provide insights into the neural dynamics of cortical columns. While these protocols are challenging to perform experimentally, modelling can serve as a powerful tool for such explorations. Using detailed electrophysiological and anatomical data from mouse V1, we built a novel spiking network model of a cortical column, which incorporates pyramidal cells and three distinct interneuron types (PV, SST, and VIP cells, specified per lamina), as well as the dynamic and voltage-dependent properties of AMPA, GABA, and NMDA receptors. We first demonstrate that thalamocortical feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) stimuli arriving in the column have opposite effects, leading to net columnar excitation and inhibition respectively and revealing translaminar gain control via full-column inhibition by layer 6. We then perturb one cell group (i.e. a cell type in a specific layer) at a time and observe the effects on other cell groups under distinct network states: spontaneous, feedforward-driven, feedback-driven, and a combination of feedforward and feedback. Our findings reveal that when a given group is perturbed, the columnar response varies significantly based on its state, with strong sensory feedforward input decreasing columnar sensitivity to all perturbations and feedback input serving as modulator of intra columnar interactions. Given that activity changes within specific neuronal populations are difficult to predict a priori in experiments, our model may constitute a useful tool to predict outcomes of perturbations and assist in experimental design.

Author SummaryIn this study, we explored how stimulating specific groups of neurons under different conditions (spontaneous or stimulus-evoked states) can help us understand the dynamics of visual cortical columns in mouse cortex. We developed a data-constrained model of a cortical column that includes several cell types (excitatory neurons as well as multiple inhibitory neuron types) and synaptic receptors. Our findings reveal that signals coming from higher brain areas (feedback input) and sensory input (feedforward input) have different impacts on the column: sensory inputs generally increase activity within the column, while feedback tends to decrease it. We then considered input targeting one cell type at a time to see how it affects the internal dynamics. Our results show that neural responses to selected input vary depending on whether the cortical column is in a resting state or being stimulated by feedforward input or feedback input. This model is a useful tool for predicting the outcomes of these cell interactions, which can help in planning real-world experiments and understanding how our brain processes information.

**Abstract:**
Synapses formed by equivalent pairs of pre- and postsynaptic neurons have similar electrophysiological characteristics, belonging to the same type. However, these are generally confined to microscopic brain regions, precluding their proteomic analysis. This fact has greatly limited our ability to investigate the molecular basis of synaptic physiology. We introduce a procedure to characterise the synaptic proteome of microscopic brain regions and explore the molecular diversity among the synapses forming the trisynaptic circuit in the hippocampus. While we observe a remarkable proteomic diversity among these synapses, we also report that proteins involved in the regulation of the function of glutamate receptors are differentially expressed in all of them. Moreover, neuron-specific gene expression programs would contribute to their regulation. Here, we introduce a combined proteomics and transcriptomics analysis uncovering a previously unrecognised neuron-specific control of synaptic proteome diversity, directed towards the regulation of glutamate receptors and their regulatory proteins.

**Abstract:**
Single-cell multiomic techniques have sparked immense interest in developing a comprehensive multi-modal map of diverse neuronal cell types and their brain wide projections. However, investigating the spatial organization, transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of brain wide projection neurons is hampered by the lack of efficient and easily adoptable tools. Here we introduce Projection-TAGs, a retrograde AAV platform that allows multiplex tagging of projection neurons using RNA barcodes. By using Projection-TAGs, we performed multiplex projection tracing of the mouse cortex and high-throughput single-cell profiling of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of the cortical projection neurons. Projection-TAGs can be leveraged to obtain a snapshot of activity-dependent recruitment of distinct projection neurons and their molecular features in the context of a specific stimulus. Given its flexibility, usability, and compatibility, we envision that Projection-TAGs can be readily applied to build a comprehensive multi-modal map of brain neuronal cell types and their projections.

## Mimicking opioid analgesia in cortical pain circuits

**Abstract:**
The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural dynamics to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviors and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep-learning behavioral analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an unpleasant, affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective-motivational behaviors without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic mu-opioid receptor promoter to drive chemogenetic inhibition. This opioid-mimetic gene therapy recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain, thereby offering a new strategy for precision pain management targeting a key nociceptive cortical opioid circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

**Abstract:**
The events that lead to protein misfolding diseases are not fully understood. Many proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., TDP43) interact with nucleic acids, including RNA G-quadruplexes. In this work, we investigate whether RNA G-quadruplexes play a role in TDP43 condensation in biophysical and cellular models. We find that G-quadruplexes modulate TDP43 aggregation in vitro and condensation in multiple cell types, including yeast, HEK293T, and motor-neuron-like NSC-34 cells. In yeast cells, treatment with G-quadruplexes causes increased TDP43 accumulation in cells before cellular death. In HEK293T cells expressing TDP43, incubation with G-quadruplex-binding small molecules causes an increase in G4 stability that also stabilizes TDP43 and reduces TDP43 condensation induced by proteasomal or oxidative stress. Finally, in NSC-34 cells overexpressing exogenous TDP43, we show that G-quadruplexes co-localize with TDP43 condensates under stress conditions and treatment with G-quadruplex-binding small molecules decreases TDP43-mediated toxicity. Together, these findings suggest that a novel future approach to explore for treating protein misfolding diseases may be to target specific RNA structures such as G-quadruplexes.

**Abstract:**
Archaeal tubulin-like cytoskeletal protein CetZ1 is required for rod-cell morphogenesis during the development of motile cells in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. It has been unknown whether CetZ1 or its paralogs contribute to motility solely through the effects of rod cell shape on swimming speed, or in other ways too. Here, we found that CetZ1 also plays significant roles in the polar assembly of the motility machinery including the archaellum base protein ArlD1, the chemotaxis sensory array adapter CheW1, and signal transducer CheY. Notably, overexpression of cetZ1 or cetZ2 differentially influenced motility and the polar assembly of the motility machinery, but caused no detectable change in the rod shape of motile cells. CetZ1 localized at the poles of motile cells, but its imperfect co-localization with the motility machineries suggests it may promote their assembly indirectly, such as via a role in organisation or structure of the cell poles.

**Abstract:**
Ion channels are necessary for proper water and nutrient absorption in the intestine, thereby supporting cellular metabolism and organismal growth. While a role for Na+ co-transporters and pumps in intestinal nutrient absorption is well defined, how individual K+ uniporters function in this process is poorly understood. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that a gain-of-function mutation in twk-26, which encodes a two-pore domain K+ ion channel orthologous to human KCNK3, facilitates nutrient absorption and suppresses the metabolic and developmental defects caused by loss of DRL-1/FLR-4 signaling. Mutations in drl-1 and flr-4, which encode two unique kinases that are components of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the downstream flr-1 Na+ ion channel, cause severe growth defects, reduced lipid storage, and a dramatic increase in autophagic lysosomes, which mirror dietary restriction phenotypes. We reveal that this dietary restriction phenotype is likely the result of impaired intestinal amino acid absorption, which is restored upon activation of TWK-26. Furthermore, we show that loss of flr-4 disrupts intracellular and extracellular pH gradients, suggesting that the FLR-4 pathway may be necessary to maintain intestinal ion homeostasis and facilitate nutrient absorption. The altered pH gradients in the flr-4 mutant are partially restored by activation of TWK-26, demonstrating a novel role for this K+ ion channel in governing intestinal physiology and metabolism.

**Abstract:**
In the canonical interpretation of dopaminergic neuron activity during Pavlovian conditioning, initially cell firing is triggered by unexpected rewards. Upon learning, activation instead follows the reward-predictive conditioned stimulus, and when expected rewards are withheld, firing is inhibited. However, little is known about dopaminergic neuron activity during the actual learning process in complex operant tasks. Here, we recorded optogenetically identified dopaminergic neurons of ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice training in multiple, successive operant sensory discrimination tasks. A delay between nose-poke choices and trial outcome signals (for reward or punishment) probed for predictive activity. During training, but prior to criterion performance, firing rates signaled correct versus incorrect choices, but prior to outcome signals. Thus, the neurons predicted whether choices would be rewarded, despite the animals' subthreshold behavioral performance. Surprisingly, these neurons also fired after reward delivery, as if the rewards had been unexpected according to the canonical view, but activity was inhibited after punishment signals, as if the reward had been expected after all. These inconsistencies suggest revision of theoretical formulations of dopaminergic neuronal activity to embody multiple roles in temporal difference learning and actor-critic models. Furthermore, on training trials when these neurons predicted that a given choice was correct and would be rewarded, surprisingly, the mice adhered to other non-rewarded and untrained task strategies (e.g., spatial alternation). The DA neurons' reward prediction activity could serve as critic signals for the choices just made. This consistent with the notion that the brain must reconcile multiple Bayesian belief representations during learning.

**Abstract:**
Target of Rapamycin (TOR) complexes and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are crucial signaling hubs that coordinate adaptive responses to environmental inputs. While GPCR-mediated regulation of TOR has been extensively studied, little is known about TOR-mediated regulation of GPCRs. Here, we establish TOR as a regulator of GPCR signaling via its control of receptor endocytosis in the yeast mating system. By pairing fluorescence microscopy with yeast genetic approaches, we identify the machinery that bridges TOR nutrient sensing to GPCR internalization. Furthermore, we find that autophagic machinery is employed during mating to deliver active receptor to the vacuole (lysosome), suppressing the mating pathway. These results demonstrate that TOR regulates the localization and signaling of the yeast mating GPCR in both ligand-dependent and -independent contexts. These pathways are highly conserved, suggesting that TOR-regulation of GPCRs may be a broadly conserved mechanism for integrating competing signals involving metabolic state and external communications.

**Abstract:**
The language of biology, encoded in DNA, RNA, and proteins, forms the foundation of life but remains challenging to decode due to its complexity. Traditional computational methods often struggle to integrate information across these molecules, limiting a comprehensive understanding of biological systems. Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with pre-trained models offer new possibilities for interpreting biological language. Here, we introduce LucaOne, a pre-trained foundation model trained on nucleic acid and protein sequences from 169,861 species. Through large-scale data integration and semi-supervised learning, LucaOne demonstrates an understanding of key biological principles, such as DNA-Protein translation. Using few-shot learning, it effectively comprehends the central dogma of molecular biology and performs competitively on tasks involving DNA, RNA, or protein inputs. Our results highlight the potential of unified foundation models to address complex biological questions, providing an adaptable framework for bioinformatics research and enhancing the interpretation of life's complexity.

**Abstract:**
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer that is unresponsive to hormonal therapies. One potential TNBC-specific therapeutic target is NQO1, as it is highly expressed in many TNBC patients and lowly expressed in non-cancer tissues. Here we use a derivative of DNQ, isobutyl-deoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ) that is more potent and specific in killing TNBC cells than NQO1-activator {beta}-lapachone while displaying strong NQO1-dependence. We evaluated the cellular signaling changes that occur following 4-hour treatment of TNBC cells with either single agent or combination IB-DNQ and / or PARP inhibitor (Rucaparib). Short treatments (4 hours) with IB-DNQ alone or combined with the PARP inhibitor Rucaparib revealed few changes in protein abundance but significant rapid alterations in protein phosphorylation and thermal stability, with clear synergy in the combination treatment. Key phosphorylated targets linked to RNA Polymerase II inhibition and DNA damage response were altered during our short time treatment. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) identified novel, combination-specific changes in protein biophysical state suggesting new therapeutic vulnerabilities in TNBC cells. Our findings highlight how even brief treatments can uncover distinct biophysical protein changes via TPP, offering a resource for mechanistic studies of IB-DNQ mechanism of action and the development of NQO1-activated therapeutics for TNBC treatment.

**Abstract:**
Accumulation of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the hippocampus triggers cognitive memory decline in Alzheimers disease (AD). The incidence and mortality of sporadic AD were tightly associated with diabetes and hyperlipidemia, while the exact linked molecular is uncertain. Here, we reported that serum Kallistatin concentrations were meaningfully higher in AD patients, with a higher concentration of fasting blood glucose and triglyceride. In addition, the constructed Kallistatin-transgenic (KAL-TG) mice defined its cognitive memory impairment phenotype and lower LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons accompanied by increased A{beta} deposition and tau phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Kallistatin could directly bind to the Notch1 receptor and thereby upregulate BACE1 expression by inhibiting PPAR{gamma} signaling, resulting in A{beta} cleavage and production. Besides, Kallistatin could promote the phosphorylation of tau by activating GSK-3{beta}. Fenofibrate, a hypolipidemic drug, could alleviate cognitive memory impairment by down-regulating A{beta} and tau phosphorylation of KAL-TG mice. Collectively, our data clarified a novel mechanism for A{beta} accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation regulation by Kallistatin, which might play a crucial role in linking metabolic syndromes and cognitive memory deterioration, and suggested that fenofibrate might have the potential for treating metabolism-related AD.

**Abstract:**
Spatial biology experiments integrate the molecular and histological landscape of tissues to provide a previously inaccessible view of tissue biology, unlocking the architecture of complex multicellular tissues. Within spatial biology, spatial transcriptomics platforms are among the most advanced, allowing researchers to characterize the expression of thousands of genes across space. These new technologies are transforming our understanding of how cells are organized in space and communicate with each other to determine emergent phenotypes. This is particularly important in cancer research, as tumor evolution is shaped not only by the genetic properties of cancer cells but also by how they interact with the tumor microenvironment and their spatial organization. While many platforms can generate spatial transcriptomics profiles, it is still unclear in which context each platform better suits the needs of its users. Here we compare the results obtained using 5 different spatial transcriptomics (VISIUM, VISIUM CytAssist, VisiumHD, Xenium, and CosMx) and one spatial proteomics (VISIUM CytAssist) platforms across serial sections of 6 FFPE samples from primary human tumors covering some of the most common forms of the disease (lung, breast, colorectal, bladder, lymphoma and ovary). We observed that the VISIUM platform with CytAssist chemistry yielded superior data quality than manual VISIUM. On the other hand, Xenium consistently produced more reliable results for in situ platforms, with better gene clustering and fewer false positives than CosMx. Importantly, these platform-based variations didn't significantly affect cell type identification. VisiumHD offers the best options of both worlds, with subcellular resolution and whole-transcriptome coverage, albeit with some limitations that need to be accounted for in downstream analyses. Finally, by comparing VISIUM protein profiles with the spatial transcriptomics data from all four platforms on each sample, we identified several genes with mismatched RNA and protein expression patterns, highlighting the importance of multi-omics profiling to reveal the true biology of human tumors.

## Surface Wetting Is a Key Determinant of α-Synuclein Condensate Maturation

**Abstract:**
-Synuclein self-assembles into amyloid fibrils during neurodegeneration. The protein can also self-assemble via liquid-liquid phase separation to form biomolecular condensates. The link between these processes is evident, as -synuclein condensates can mature into amyloids. However, the mechanisms driving this maturation remain largely unknown, particularly when incorporating pathological post-translational modifications known to affect -synuclein self-assembly in the absence of LLPS, such as N-terminal truncation. Moreover, condensates are primarily studied as isolated entities; however, it is increasingly evident that they interact with various cellular components and surfaces. Here, we developed a microscopy-based quantitative real-time imaging protocol to investigate how N-terminal truncation influences -synuclein condensate formation, well surface wetting, and maturation. We found that increasing -synuclein truncation, which reduces N-terminal hydrophobicity, inhibits condensate sedimentation, enhances surface wettability, and accelerates maturation. Additionally, by increasing well surface hydrophobicity we decreased -synuclein condensate wettability, delaying their maturation. Thus, we propose that enhanced wettability, which increases the condensate surface-to-volume ratio, promotes -synuclein nucleation at the condensate-bulk solution interface, thereby accelerating maturation. Our results reveal distinct mechanistic roles for -synuclein N-terminal residues and indicate that condensate wetting on cellular surfaces, such as synaptic vesicles, may drive toxic aggregate formation during neurodegeneration.

**Abstract:**
Spatial transcriptomics technologies aim to localize gene expression in tissues and typically use capture surfaces that have undergone spatial indexing or optical decoding to relate surface sequences to spatial positions. Slide-tags is a recently developed method by Russell et al. that inverts this principle, instead diffusing probes from a pre-decoded bead array into tissues, tagging nuclei with spatial bead barcodes. We reanalyzed this data and discovered a latent, spatially informative cell-bead network formed incidentally as a result of barcode diffusion and the biophysical properties of the tissue. By optimizing proximity constraints encoded in the cell-bead network structure, we could infer cell locations without any spatial indexing, placing Slide-tags among a new generation of optics-free, network-based imaging-by-sequencing approaches, a fundamental departure from classical spatial sequencing technologies based on pre-indexed arrays.

**Abstract:**
Animals must balance the urgent need to find food during starvation with the critical necessity to avoid toxic substances to ensure their survival. In Drosophila, specialized Gustatory Receptors (GRs) expressed in Gustatory Receptor Neurons (GRNs) are critical for distinguishing between nutritious and potentially toxic food. GRNs project their axons from taste organs to the Subesophageal Zone (SEZ) in the Central Brain (CB) of Drosophila, where gustatory information is processed. Although the roles of GRs and GRNs are well-documented, the processing of gustatory information in the SEZ remains unclear. To better understand gustatory sensory processing and feeding decision-making, we molecularly characterized the first layer of gustatory interneurons, referred to as Gustatory Second-Order Neurons (G2Ns), which receive direct input from GRNs. Using trans-synaptic tracing with trans-Tango, cell sorting, and bulk RNAseq under fed and starved conditions, we discovered that G2Ns vary based on gustatory input and that their molecular profile changes with the fly's metabolic state. Further data analysis has revealed that a pair of neurons in the SEZ, expressing the neuropeptide Leucokinin (SELK neurons), receive simultaneous input from GRNs sensing bitter (potentially toxic) and sweet (nutritious) information. Additionally, these neurons also receive inputs regarding the starvation levels of the fly. These results highlight a novel mechanism of feeding regulation and metabolic integration.

**Abstract:**
Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures support long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and childrens home literacy environments, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to first-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop by birth but undergo further refinement between infancy and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.

Significance StatementReading is crucial for academic, vocational, and health outcomes, but acquiring proficient reading skills is a protracted developmental process involving lower-level subskills and brain structures that undergo rapid development starting in infancy. We examined how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development support long-term acquisition of reading using a reproducible pipeline we developed specifically for infant-to-school-age longitudinal MRI data. Findings suggest that the brain bases of reading-related skills begin to develop by birth but continue building between infancy and preschool. This study emphasizes the importance of considering academic skill acquisition as a dynamic process preceding the emergence of the skill, and it offers a roadmap for future studies to examine relationships between early brain development and academic skill acquisition.

**Abstract:**
Many archaea appear to divide through the coordinated activities of two FtsZ homologues (FtsZ1 and FtsZ2) and another bacterial cell division homologue (SepF), which are part of the midcell division ring. Here, we identify an additional protein (HVO_0739, renamed CdpA) that is involved in cell division in Haloferax volcanii, with homologues in other Haloarchaea. CdpA localizes at the mid-cell division ring, and this requires the presence of the ring-assembly protein FtsZ1. The division constriction protein FtsZ2 also influenced the proper midcell assembly and structure of CdpA. In the absence of CdpA, cells frequently failed to divide properly, and FtsZ1 formed poorly condensed pseudo-helical structures spanning across a broad region of the cell, whereas FtsZ2 showed mispositioned foci, nano-rings, and filaments. The rate of directional movement of FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 structures around the division ring appeared minimally affected by loss of CdpA, which resulted in continual repositioning of the aberrant FtsZ structures in the cells. In contrast to the FtsZ proteins, CdpA formed relatively immobile foci around the ring. Protein domain function studies, pull-down assays, and multimer structure predictions suggest that CdpA is part of a membrane complex that tethers FtsZ2 and other division proteins to the midcell membrane. Our discovery of an archaeal FtsZ organisation and midcell anchor protein offers new insights into cell division mechanisms that are similar across the tree of life.

**Abstract:**
The organization of cell-cell contacts is fundamental for multi-cellular life and operation of organs. Synapses, prototypic contact sites for neuronal communication, are key to brain function and work over the last decades identified multiple synaptic cell adhesion molecules (sCAMs) that drive their organization. Whether these sCAMs operate independently or in coordination through yet unknown linker proteins remained elusive. Here, we used a systematic large-scale multi-epitope affinity-purification approach combined with quantitative mass spectrometry and immuno-EM to comprehensively map trans-synaptic protein networks in the mouse brain. We discover a presynaptic core-module assembled from the two major sCAM families, Neurexins1-3 and LAR-type receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRD,S,F), and the previously uncharacterized tetraspanin proteins T178A, B. These ternary Neurexin-T178-PTPR complexes form through their transmembrane domains and assemble during biogenesis in the ER. Loss of T178B results in module dissociation, strong reduction of LAR-PTPRs and redistribution of synaptic Neurexins. At synapses, the Neurexin-T178-PTPR module recruits stable and extended trans-synaptic protein networks with defined pre- and post-synaptic partners and secreted extracellular linkers. The network architecture robustly interlinks the distinct functional modules/machineries of the presynaptic active zone and establishes tight associations with XKR-type lipid scramblases and postsynaptic GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors. Our data identify a universal presynaptic core-module for synaptic adhesion and trans-synaptic signaling in the mammalian brain.

**Abstract:**
Cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography provide crucial experimental data for obtaining atomic-detail models of biomacromolecules. Refining these models relies on library-based stereochemical restraints, which, in addition to being limited to known chemical entities, do not include meaningful noncovalent interactions relying solely on nonbonded repulsions. Quantum mechanical (QM) calculations could alleviate these issues but are too expensive for large molecules. We present a novel AI-enabled Quantum Refinement (AQuaRef) based on AIMNet2 neural network potential mimicking QM at substantially lower computational costs. By refining 41 cryo-EM and 30 X-ray structures, we show that this approach yields atomic models with superior geometric quality compared to standard techniques, while maintaining an equal or better fit to experimental data. Notably, AQuaRef aids in determining proton positions, as illustrated in the challenging case of short hydrogen bonds in the parkinsonism-associated human protein DJ-1 and its bacterial homolog YajL.

**Abstract:**
Background: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane-bound receptors that transmit critical signals from extracellular to intracellular spaces. Transcriptomic data of resected breast tumors show that low mRNA expression of orphan GPCR GPR52 correlates with reduced overall survival in patients with breast cancer, leading to the hypothesis that loss of GPR52 supports breast cancer progression. Methods: CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knockout GPR52 in the human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, and in the non-cancerous breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. 2D and 3D in vitro studies, electron microscopy, Matrigel culture, and a zebrafish xenograft model were used to assess the morphology and behavior of GPR52 KO cells. RNA-sequencing and proteomic analyses were also conducted on these cell lines, and transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to compare GPR52-null and wild-type (WT) signatures in breast cancer. Results: Loss of GPR52 was found to be associated with increased cell-cell interaction in 2D cultures, altered 3D spheroid morphology, and increased propensity to organize and invade collectively in Matrigel. Furthermore, GPR52 loss was associated with features of EMT in MDA-MB-468 cells, and zebrafish injected with GPR52 KO cells developed a greater total cancer area than those injected with control cells. RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses of GPR52-null breast cancer cells revealed an increased cAMP signaling signature. Consistently, we found that treatment of wild-type (WT) cells with forskolin, which stimulates the production of cAMP, induces phenotypic changes associated with GPR52 loss, and inhibition of cAMP production rescued some GPR52 KO phenotypes. Conclusion: GPR52 is an orphan GPCR and its role in cancer progression has not been previously characterized. We found that GPR52 loss in breast cancer cells can lead to increased cell clustering, collective invasion, and EMT in vitro. These are features of increased cancer aggression. Our results reveal that GPR52 loss is a potential mechanism by which breast cancer progression may occur and support the investigation of GPR52 agonism as a therapeutic option for breast cancer.

**Abstract:**
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) occur primarily in the small intestine, lung and pancreas. Due to their rarity compared to other malignancies in these organs, their complex biology remains poorly understood, including their oncogenesis, tumor composition and the intriguing phenomena of mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN). Here we profiled ten low-grade small intestine NET (SiNET) tumor samples as well as one mixed lung tumor by single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq. We find that SiNETs are largely separated into two distinct subtypes, in which the neuroendocrine cells upregulate epithelial or neuronal markers, respectively. Surprisingly, in both subtypes the neuroendocrine cells are largely non-proliferative while higher proliferation is observed in multiple non-malignant cell types. Specifically, B and plasma cells are highly proliferative in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype, potentially reflecting the outcome of high Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) expression in those tumors, which may constitute a relevant target. Finally, our analysis of a mixed lung neuroendocrine tumor identifies a population of putative progenitor cells that may give rise to both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (squamous) cells, potentially explaining the origin of the mixed histology. Taken together, our results provide important insights and hypotheses regarding the biology of neuroendocrine neoplasms.

**Abstract:**
Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced our understanding of meaning representation in the human brain. However, increasingly large LLMs have been questioned as valid cognitive models due to their extensive training data and their ability to access context hundreds of words long. In this study, we investigated whether instruction tuning, another core technique in recent LLMs beyond mere scaling, can enhance models' ability to capture linguistic information in the human brain. We evaluated the self-attention of base and fine-tuned LLMs of different sizes against human eye movement and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity patterns during naturalistic reading. We show that scaling has a greater impact than instruction tuning on model-brain alignment, reinforcing the scaling law in brain encoding performance. These finding have significant implications for understanding the cognitive plausibility of LLMs and their role in studying naturalistic language comprehension.

**Abstract:**
Intravital microscopy (IVM) enables live imaging of animals at single-cell level, offering essential insights into cancer progression. This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological and dynamic single cell features. BEHAV3D-TP integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers without advanced computational expertise to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.

**Abstract:**
Sound encoding depends on the precise and reliable neurotransmission at the afferent synapses between the sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation, as well as interplay between the pre- and postsynaptic components remain largely unclear. Here, we tested the role of the synaptic adhesion molecule and Nogo/RTN4 receptor homolog RTN4RL2 (also referred to as NgR2) in the development and function of afferent IHC-SGN synapses. Upon deletion of RTN4RL2 in mice (RTN4RL2-/-), presynaptic IHC active zones showed enlarged synaptic ribbons and a depolarized shift in the activation of CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels. The postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of SGNs were smaller and deficient of GluA2-4 despite maintained Gria2 mRNA expression in SGNs. Next to synaptically engaged PSDs we observed &#x0022orphan&#x0022 PSDs located away from IHCs. They likely belong to a subset of SGN peripheral neurites that do not contact the IHCs in RTN4RL2-/- cochleae as found by volume electron microscopy reconstruction of SGN neurites. Auditory brainstem responses of RTN4RL2-/- mice showed increased sound thresholds indicating impaired hearing. Together, these findings suggest that RTN4RL2 contributes to the proper formation and function of auditory afferent synapses and is critical for normal hearing.

**Abstract:**
Yeast Def1 promotes transcription elongation and RNA polymerase II degradation during genotoxic stress. Def1 is cytoplasmic, and DNA damage signals cause its proteolytic processing, liberating its N-terminus to enter the nucleus. Cytoplasmic functions for this abundant protein have not been identified. Proximity-labeling (BioID) experiments indicate that Def1 binds many proteins involved in posttranscriptional control and translation of mRNAs. Deleting DEF1 reduces both mRNA synthesis and decay rates and directly tethering Def1 to a reporter mRNA suppressed expression, suggesting that Def1 directly regulates mRNAs post-transcriptionally. Surprisingly, we found that Def1 interacts with polyribosomes, which requires its N-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain and ubiquitylation of eS7a (Rsp7A) in the small subunit of the ribosome by the Not4 protein in the Ccr4-Not complex. Ribo-seq analysis revealed that deleting DEF1 affected the translation efficiency of a specific subset of transcripts, a genome-wide shift in ribosome footprints on mRNAs and an increase in the dwelling of ribosomes at non-optimal codons. This, together with the high sensitivity of def1{Delta} to translation inhibitors further suggest impaired translation. The polyglutamine-rich unstructured C-terminus of Def1 is required for its interaction with decay and translation factors, suggesting that Def1 acts as a ubiquitin-dependent scaffold to link translation status to mRNA decay. Thus, we have identified a novel function for this transcription and DNA damage response factor in post-transcriptional regulation in the cytoplasm and establish Def1 as a master regulator of gene expression, functioning from transcription to translation.

**Abstract:**
SomaScan and Olink are affinity-based platforms that aim to estimate the relative abundance of thousands of human proteins with a broad range of endogenous concentrations. In this study, we investigated the effects of in vitro hemolysis and repeated freeze-thaw cycles in protein abundance quantification across 10,776 (11K SomaScan) and 1472 (Olink Explore 1536) analytes, respectively. Using SomaScan, we found two distinct groups, each one consisting of 4% of all aptamers, affected by either hemolysis or freeze-thaw cycles. Using Olink, we found 6% of analytes affected by freeze-thaw cycles and nearly half of all measured probes significantly impacted by hemolysis. Moreover, we observed that Olink probes affected by hemolysis target proteins with a larger number of annotated protein-protein interactions. We found that Olink probes affected by hemolysis were significantly associated with the erythrocyte proteome, whereas SomaScan probes were not. Given the extent of the observed nuisance effects, we propose that unbiased, quantitative methods of evaluating hemolysis, such as the hemolysis index successfully implemented in many clinical laboratories, should be adopted in proteomics studies. We provide detailed results for each SomaScan and Olink probe in the form of extensive Supplementary Data files to be used as resources for the growing user communities of both platforms.

**Abstract:**
Social cognition develops through a complex interplay between neural maturation and environmental factors, yet the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Using a naturalistic fMRI paradigm, we investigated the effects of age and parental caregiving on social brain development and Theory of Mind (ToM) in 34 mother-child dyads. The functional maturity of social brain networks was positively associated with age, while mother-child neural synchronization during movie viewing was related to dyadic relationship quality. Crucially, parenting and child factors interactively shaped social cognition outcomes, mediated by ToM abilities. Our findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay of neurocognitive development and interpersonal synchrony in early childhood social cognition, and provide novel evidence for Bandura's theory of social learning and reciprocal determinism. This integrative approach, bridging brain, behavior, and parenting environment, advances our understanding of the complex mechanisms shaping social cognition. The insights gained can inform personalized interventions promoting social competence, emphasizing the critical importance of nurturing parental relationships in facilitating healthy social development.

**Abstract:**
The emerging electron microscopy connectome datasets provides connectivity maps of the brains at single cell resolution, enabling us to estimate various network statistics, such as connectedness. We desire the ability to assess how the functional complexity of these networks depends on these network statistics. To this end, we developed an analysis pipeline and a statistic, XORness, which quantifies the functional complexity of these networks with varying network statistics. We illustrate that actual connectomes have high XORness, as do generated connectomes with the same network statistics, suggesting a normative role for functional complexity in guiding the evolution of connectomes, and providing clues to guide the development of artificial neural networks.

## Bioinformatic discovery of type 11 secretion system (T11SS) cargo across the Proteobacteria

**Abstract:**
Type 11 secretion systems (T11SS) are broadly distributed among proteobacteria, with more than 3,000 T11SS family outer membrane proteins (OMPs) comprising 10 major sequence similarity network (SSN) clusters. Of these, only 7, all from animal-associated cluster 1, have been experimentally verified as secretins of cargo, including adhesins, hemophores, and metal binding proteins. To identify novel cargo of a more diverse set of T11SS, we identified gene families co-occurring in gene neighborhoods with either cluster 1 or marine microbe-associated cluster 3 T11SS OMP genes. We developed bioinformatic controls to ensure perceived co-occurrences are specific to T11SS, and not general to OMPs. We found that both cluster 1 and cluster 3 T11SS OMPs frequently co-occur with single carbon metabolism and nucleotide synthesis pathways, but that only cluster 1 T11SS OMPs had significant co-occurrence with metal and heme pathways, as well as with mobile genetic islands, potentially indicating diversified function of this cluster. Cluster 1 T11SS co-occurrences included 2,556 predicted cargo proteins, unified by the presence of a C-terminal {beta}-barrel domain, which fall into 141 predicted UniRef50 clusters and approximately 10 different architectures: 4 similar to known cargo and 6 uncharacterized types. We experimentally demonstrate T11SS-dependent secretion of an uncharacterized cargo type with homology to Plasmin sensitive protein (Pls). Unexpectedly, genes encoding marine cluster 3 T11SS OMPs only rarely co-occurred with the C-terminal {beta}-barrel domain and instead frequently co-occurred with DUF1194-containing genes. Overall, our results show that with sufficiently large-scale and controlled genomic data, T11SS-dependent cargo proteins can be accurately predicted.

**Abstract:**
Kinetochores link chromosomes to dynamic microtubules of the mitotic spindle. To ensure equal chromosome segregation, sister chromatids must achieve biorientation. The conserved kinase Aurora B phosphorylates outer kinetochore proteins on attachments lacking tension, allowing re-establishment of new connections until biorientation is achieved. Aurora B localizes to the centromere as part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), but the underlying recruitment pathways can be eliminated without disrupting biorientation. It therefore remains unclear how the kinase operates during error correction. Here, we identify the conserved Spc105/Kre28 complex as an outer kinetochore receptor of the Aurora kinase Ipl1 and its activator Sli15 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that mutations in the helix bundle domain of Spc105/Kre28 impair mitotic error correction, resembling the effects of ipl1 or sli15 mutants. The defects can be suppressed by artificial recruitment of Ipl1. In biochemical experiments Ipl1/Sli15 directly associates with Spc105/Kre28, and a conserved segment in the Sli15 central domain is crucially involved in the binding mechanism. These results have important implications for the mechanism of tension-dependent error correction during chromosome biorientation.

Functional MRI (fMRI) using the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal provides valuable insight into grey matter activity. However, uncertainty surrounds the white matter BOLD signal. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) offers an alternative fMRI contrast sensitive to transient cellular deformations during neural activity, facilitating detection of both grey and white matter activity. Further, through minimising vascular contamination, ADC-fMRI has the potential to overcome the limited temporal specificity of the BOLD signal. However, the use of linear diffusion encoding introduces sensitivity to fibre directionality, while averaging over multiple directions comes at great cost to temporal resolution. In this study, we used spherical b-tensor encoding to impart diffusion sensitisation in all directions per shot, providing an ADC-fMRI contrast capable of detecting activity independently of fibre directionality. We provide evidence from two task-based experiments on a clinical scanner that isotropic ADC-fMRI is more temporally specific than BOLD-fMRI, and offers more balanced mapping of grey and white matter activity. We further demonstrate that isotropic ADC-fMRI detects white matter activity independently of fibre direction, while linear ADC-fMRI preferentially detects activity in voxels containing fibres perpendicular to the diffusion encoding direction. Thus, isotropic ADC-fMRI opens avenues for investigation into whole-brain grey and white matter functional connectivity.

**Abstract:**
Kinesin motor proteins facilitate microtubule-based transport by converting chemical energy into mechanic forces, but this activity is autoinhibited until cargo is loaded. Regulatory mechanisms underlying this autoinhibitory conformation are not well understood. Here, we show that a NEver in mitosis Kinase NEKL-3 directly phosphorylates a flexible elbow region between two coiled coil domains connecting the motor head and tail of an intraflagellar transport kinesin, OSM-3. The phosphor dead (PD) mutation, but not phosphor mimic (PM) mutation, induce constitutive motility of OSM-3 in vitro. Using knock-in animals, we discovered that both PD and PM mutations shorten the C. elegans sensory cilia. The constitutively active OSM-3PD fails to enter cilia and abnormally accumulates in neurites, mimicking another hyperactive mutation, OSM-3G444E. Conversely, OSM-3PM enters cilia but moves at a reduced speed, indicating an inhibitory role of elbow phosphorylation in kinesin motility. These findings highlight the crucial role of elbow phosphorylation in regulating kinesin autoinhibition.

**Abstract:**
The Flower protein was suggested to couple the fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) to their recycling in different model organisms. It is supposed to trigger activity-dependent bulk endocytosis by conducting Ca2+ at endocytic sites. However, this mode of action is debated. Here, we investigated the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog FLWR-1 in neurotransmission. Our results confirm that FLWR-1 facilitates the recycling of SVs at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Ultrastructural analysis of synaptic boutons after hyperstimulation revealed an accumulation of large endocytic structures in flwr1 mutants. These findings do not support a role of FLWR-1 in the formation of bulk endosomes but rather a function in their breakdown. Unexpectedly, loss of FLWR-1 led to increased neuronal Ca2+ levels in axon terminals during stimulation, particularly in GABAergic motor neurons, causing excitation-inhibition imbalance. We found that this increased NMJ transmission might be caused by deregulation of MCA-3, the nematode orthologue of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA). In vivo molecular interactions indicated that FLWR-1 may be a positive regulator of the PMCA and might influence its recycling through modification of plasma membrane levels of PI(4,5)P2.

**Abstract:**
Membrane pore-forming proteins (PFPs) form ring-shaped membrane-translocating oligomers on membranes, contributing to infection, immunity, and cell death functions. Binary toxins produced by some bacteria consist of an enzymatic component that acts as a toxin and a membrane-binding component that forms a pore that delivers the enzymatic component into target cells. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has advanced our understanding of these translocation mechanisms by revealing several binary toxin complexes structures. However, the mechanisms underlying the initial pore formation remain unclear. We determined the structures of several oligomeric forms of the membrane-binding component, Ib, of the Iota toxin from Clostridium perfringens at various stages of pore formation. Structural comparisons revealed that the symmetrically arranged soluble oligomer (prepore) became a transmembrane oligomer (pore). These findings enhance our understanding of the PFP mechanisms and provide a structural basis for developing nanodevices using membrane pores.

**Abstract:**
Biological processes are fundamentally dynamic, yet existing methods for capturing these temporal changes are limited. We present scDynaBar, a novel approach that integrates CRISPR-Cas9 dynamic barcoding with single-cell sequencing to enable the recording of temporal cellular events. In this system, genetic barcodes accumulate mutations over a 25-day period and then are sequenced together with the transcriptome of each single cell. We propose that this gradual accumulation of genetic diversity can be exploited to create an ordered record of a cellular event. We apply this approach to track the transition from a pluripotent state to a two-cell (2C)-like state in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The results provide compelling evidence for the transient nature of the 2C-like state. Additionally, our system shows consistent mutation rates across diverse cell types in a mouse gastruloid model, underscoring its robustness and versatility across various biological contexts. This technique not only improves our ability to study single-cell dynamics but also creates new opportunities for recording other temporal signals, in other words, using dynamic barcoding as a molecular clock in individual cells.

**Abstract:**
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that represent the largest and most therapeutically targeted receptor class, accounting for 30% of currently marketed drugs. Two binding motifs for membrane cholesterol, the cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) domain and the cholesterol consensus motif (CCM), have been postulated. Using a simulation of the molecular dynamics of cholesterol association with the receptor, we predicted the binding of membrane cholesterol to non-canonical sites, distinct from CRAC and CCM, at muscarinic and opioid receptors. We identified a binding site common to muscarinic and opioid receptors at TM6, with arginine 6.35 as the major residue. Membrane cholesterol depletion mimics the effects of R6.35 mutations, confirming its role in receptor modulation. Targeting cholesterol-binding sites offers novel pharmacotherapeutic strategies, including tissue-specific sterol-based modulation.

**Abstract:**
Systemic inflammation can lead to neuroinflammation with acute consequences such as delirium and long-lasting deleterious effects including cognitive decline and the exacerbation of neurodegenerative disease progression. Here we show that transcription factor Nrf2 controls brain endothelial cell homeostasis and barrier strength. We found that peripheral inflammation caused infiltration of macrophages, microglial activation and inflammatory reactive astrogliosis, all of which could be prevented by RTA-404, an activator of the transcription factor Nrf2 and close structural relative of the recently FDA-approved Nrf2 activator RTA-408 (Omaveloxolone). To identify the key cellular mediator(s), we generated an endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 knockout mouse. Strikingly, the effects of RTA-404 on brain endothelial activation and downstream neuroinflammatory events was abolished by endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 deletion. This places endothelial cell Nrf2 as a peripherally accessible therapeutic target to reduce the CNS-adverse consequences of systemic inflammation.

**Abstract:**
As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge capable of evading neutralizing antibodies, it has become increasingly important to fully understand the breadth and functional profile of T cell responses to determine their impact on the immune surveillance of variant strains. Here, sampling healthy individuals, we profiled the kinetics and polyfunctionality of T cell immunity elicited by mRNA vaccination. Modeling of anti-spike T cell responses against ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that epitope immunodominance and cross-reactivity are major predictive determinants of T cell immunity. To identify immunodominant epitopes across the viral proteome, we generated a comprehensive map of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes within non-spike proteins that induced polyfunctional T cell responses in convalescent patients. We found that immunodominant epitopes mainly resided within regions that were minimally disrupted by mutations in emerging variants. Conservation analysis across historical human coronaviruses combined with in silico alanine scanning mutagenesis of non-spike proteins underscored the functional importance of mutationally-constrained immunodominant regions. Collectively, these findings identify immunodominant T cell epitopes across the mutationally-constrained SARS-CoV-2 proteome, potentially providing immune surveillance against emerging variants, and inform the design of next-generation vaccines targeting antigens throughout SARS-CoV-2 proteome for broader and more durable protection.

**Abstract:**
Plasma membrane rupture and the release of cytosolic contents are hallmarks of necrotic cell death. The plasma membrane protein ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) actively promotes cell lysis by polymerizing into membrane embedded filaments that induce the formation of large plasma membrane lesions. Yet the signals controlling NINJ1 oligomerization and lesion opening remain unknown. Here, we combine cell biology and biophysical measurements to characterize the steps preceding NINJ1-induced PMR. Our results show that NINJ1 lesions form through a 2-step mechanism requiring oligomerization, which is triggered by signal 1, and subsequent lesion opening driven by signal 2, which we determine to be cell swelling without a concomitant increase in intracellular pressure. The close homolog NINJ2 oligomerizes with similar kinetics to NINJ1 but fails to form lesions during cell swelling. NINJ1-NINJ2 chimeras identify that the unstructured N-terminal region of NINJ1 controls lesion opening. In summary, our data establish a 2-step model for NINJ1-driven necrosis.

**Abstract:**
Tandem repeats (TRs) - highly polymorphic, repetitive sequences dispersed across the human genome - are crucial regulators of gene expression and diverse biological processes, but have remained underexplored relative to other classes of genetic variation due to historical challenges in their accurate calling and analysis. Here, we leverage whole genome and single-cell RNA sequencing from over 5.4 million blood-derived cells from 1,925 individuals to explore the impact of variation in over 1.7 million polymorphic TR loci on blood cell type-specific gene expression. We identify over 62,000 single-cell expression quantitative trait TR loci (sc-eTRs), 16.6% of which are specific to one of 28 distinct immune cell types. Further fine-mapping uncovers 4,283 sc-eTRs as candidate causal drivers of gene expression in 13.6% of genes tested genome-wide. We show through colocalization that TRs are likely mediators of genetic associations with immune-mediated and hematological traits in over 700 genes, and further identify novel TRs warranting investigation in rare disease cohorts. TRs are critical, yet long-overlooked, contributors to cell type-specific gene expression, with implications for understanding rare disease pathogenesis and the genetic architecture of complex traits.

**Abstract:**
Structural covariance in brain anatomy is thought to reflect inter-regional sharing of developmental influences - although this hypothesis has proved hard to causally test. Here, we use neuroimaging in humans and mice to study sex-differences in anatomical covariance - asking if regions that have developed shared sex differences in volume also show shared sex differences in volume covariance. This study design illuminates both the biology of sex-differenes and theoretical models for anatomical covariance - benefitting from tests of inter-species convergence. We find that volumetric structural covariance is stronger in adult females compared to adult males for both wild-type mice and healthy human subjects: 98% of all comparisons with statistically significant covariance sex differences in mice are female-biased, while 76% of all such comparisons are female-biased in humans (q < 0.05). In both species, a region's covariance and volumetric sex-biases have weak inverse relationships to each other: volumetrically male-biased regions contain more female-biased covariation (mice: r = -0.185, p = 0.002; humans: r = -0.189, p = 0.001). Our results identify a conserved tendency for females to show stronger neuroanatomical covariance than males, evident across species, which suggests that stronger structural covariance in females could be an evolutionarily conserved feature that is partially related to volumetric alterations through sex.

**Abstract:**
AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCurrent electrophysiological approaches can track the activity of many neurons, yet it is usually unknown which cell-types or brain areas are being recorded without further molecular or histological analysis. Developing accurate and scalable algorithms for identifying the cell-type and brain region of recorded neurons is thus crucial for improving our understanding of neural computation. In this work, we develop a multimodal contrastive learning approach for neural data that can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks, including inference of cell-type and brain location. We utilize this approach to jointly embed the activity autocorrelations and extracellular waveforms of individual neurons. We demonstrate that our embedding approach, Neuronal Embeddings via MultimOdal contrastive learning (NEMO), paired with supervised fine-tuning, achieves state-of-the-art cell-type classification for two opto-tagged datasets and brain region classification for the public International Brain Laboratory Brain-wide Map dataset. Our method represents a promising step towards accurate cell-type and brain region classification from electrophysiological recordings.

**Abstract:**
Mitochondria, the double membrane-bound organelles of endosymbiotic origin, are crucial centers for cellular energy production and several essential metabolic pathways. Recent studies reveal that mitochondria become dysfunctional following numerous cellular stresses, and during pathologies, demanding an extensive investigation of mitochondrial turnover mechanisms. Apart from the specific response pathways to tackle different stresses, mitophagy or degradation of mitochondria by autophagy is a critical quality control mechanism that clears irreversibly damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy is majorly executed either by receptor-mediated or PINK-Parkin-dependent pathways. Here, we show that the human orthologue of yeast Vms1, ANKZF1, participates in PINK-Parkin-mediated mitophagy. We show that ANKZF1 is extensively recruited to damaged mitochondria along with Parkin during mitochondrial proteotoxic stress induced by the expression of a single misfolded/aggregated protein or during uncoupler-induced membrane depolarization. Importantly, ANKZF1 recruitment to damaged mitochondria is significantly enhanced in the presence of Parkin, and ANKZF1 physically interacts with Parkin and LC3 during mitochondrial proteotoxic or depolarization stresses. ANKZF1 harbors six putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs), LIR4 present at residues 333-336 is particularly important for ANKZF1-LC3 interaction. Furthermore, we show that ANKZF1 knockout cells are compromised in clearing stress-damaged mitochondria by mitophagy, indicating an important role of ANKZF1 in mitochondrial turnover during stress. In summary, we show a new role of ANKZF1 in eliminating the stress-damaged mitochondria, reiterating the mito-protective role of Vms1/ANKZF1 during mitochondrial stresses.

## Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate restores TDP-43 pathology-driven genome repair deficiency in motor neuron diseases

**Abstract:**
TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In our recent discovery, we identified that TDP-43 plays an essential role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair via the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. Here, we found persistent DNA damage in the brains of ALS/FTD patients, primarily in the transcribed regions of the genome. We further investigated the underlying mechanism and found that polynucleotide kinase 3-phosphatase (PNKP) activity was severely impaired in the nuclear extracts of both patient brains and TDP-43-depleted cells. PNKP is a key player in DSB repair within the transcribed genome, where its 3-P termini processing activity is crucial for preventing persistent DNA damage and neuronal death. The inactivation of PNKP in ALS/FTD was due to reduced levels of its interacting partner, phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose 2,6 bisphosphatase (PFKFB3), and its biosynthetic product, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), an allosteric modulator of glycolysis. Recent work from our group has shown that F2,6BP acts as a positive modulator of PNKP activity in vivo. Notably, exogenous supplementation with F2,6BP restored PNKP activity in nuclear extracts from ALS/FTD brain samples and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells harboring pathological mutations. Supplementation of F2,6BP also reduced the pathogenic phosphorylation of TDP-43 and cytosolic protein aggregation, both hallmarks of ALS pathology, in patient-derived mutant cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that supplementation of F2,6BP restores genome integrity and partially rescues motor phenotype in a Drosophila model of ALS. Our findings underscore the possibility of exploring the therapeutic potential of F2,6BP or its analogs in TDP-43 pathology-associated motor neuron diseases.

## Astrocytic connexin43 phosphorylation contributes to seizure susceptibility after mild Traumatic Brain Injury

**Abstract:**
Astrocytes play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis through functional gap junctions (GJs) primarily formed by connexin43 (Cx43) in the cortical gray matter. These GJs facilitate electrical and metabolic coupling between astrocytes, allowing the passage of ions, glucose, and metabolites. Dysregulation of Cx43 has been implicated in various pathologies, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired epilepsy. After mild TBI/concussion, we previously identified a subset of atypical astrocytes, which are correlated with the development of spontaneous seizures. These astrocytes exhibit reduced Cx43 expression and coupling. However, atypical astrocytes represent a relatively small subset of astrocytes within the cortical gray matter and previous studies suggest an overall increase of Cx43 protein after TBI. Additionally, Cx43 also has non-junctional and channel-independent functions, which include hemichannel communication with the extracellular milieu, cell adhesion, protein trafficking, protein-protein interactions, and intracellular signaling. In the present study, we set out to determine how mild TBI initiates alterations to Cx43 protein expression and localization, how they may be regulated, and whether they contribute to seizure susceptibility. We demonstrate remarkable heterogeneity of Cx43 protein levels from astrocyte to astrocyte. In accordance with our previous findings, a subset of astrocytes lost Cx43 expression, yet total cortical Cx43 protein increased. At the subcellular level, junctional Cx43 protein levels remained stable, while hemichannels and/or cytoplasmic Cx43 were increased. Phosphorylation of Cx43 at serine 368, a key regulatory site influencing GJ assembly and function, increased after mild TBI. Critically, Cx43S368A mutant mice, lacking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. These findings suggest that TBI-induced Cx43 phosphorylation enhances seizure susceptibility, while inhibiting this modification presents a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure development.

Significance statementConnexin43 (Cx43) is the main protein comprising astrocyte gap junctions which mediate astrocyte coupling into cellular networks, but it also has other non-junctional functions. Many pathologies present with altered Cx43 regulation. In this study, we assessed Cx43 alterations after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a mouse model. We found that while some astrocytes lost Cx43 expression, other astrocytes had increased cytoplasmic and hemichannel Cx43. This increase correlated with an increase in phosphorylated Cx43 at serine 368. Cx43S368A mutant mice, lacking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced susceptibility to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). These findings suggest that TBI-induced Cx43 phosphorylation enhances seizure susceptibility.

**Abstract:**
Protein abundance tends to be more evolutionarily conserved than mRNA levels both within and between species, yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are widespread cis-regulatory elements in eukaryotic genomes that regulate translation, but it remains unclear whether and how uORFs contribute to stabilizing protein levels. In this study, we performed ribosome translation simulations on mRNA to quantitatively assess the extent to which uORF translation influences the translational variability of downstream coding sequences (CDSs) across varying contexts. Our simulations revealed that uORF translation dampens CDS translational variability, with buffering capacity increasing in proportion to uORF efficiency, length, and number. We then compared the translatomes at different developmental stages of two Drosophila species, demonstrating that uORFs buffer mRNA translation fluctuations during both evolution and development. Experimentally, deleting a uORF in the bicoid (bcd) gene-a prominent example of translational buffering-resulted in extensive changes in gene expression and phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster. Additionally, we observed uORF-mediated buffering between primates and within human populations. Together, our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which uORFs stabilize gene translation during development and across evolutionary time.

**Abstract:**
Protein-small molecule interactions, or receptor-ligand interactions, are essential for understanding biological processes and advancing drug design. Despite advancements, existing prediction models of these interactions still lack the capabilities and accuracy needed to replace traditional screening. In this paper, we introduce DockFormer, a method that leverages multi-modal learning to predict both the binding affinity and structure of these interactions. DockFormer employs fully flexible docking, where no part of the receptor remains rigid, by adapting the AlphaFold2 architecture. Instead of relying on protein sequences and Multiple Sequence Alignments, DockFormer uses predicted receptor structures as input. This modification enables the model to concentrate on ligand docking prediction rather than protein folding, while preserving full receptor flexibility. The streamlined design also reduces the model size to just 8 layers, compared to AlphaFold2's 48 layers, greatly accelerating the inference process and making it more efficient for large-scale screening. When evaluated on affinity benchmarks such as CASF-2016, PLINDER, and the recently released CASP16 ligand screening benchmark, DockFormer performs comparably to or better than state-of-the-art methods, which typically rely on templates or bound structures as input. On structural benchmarks such as Posebusters and PLINDER, DockFormer demonstrated success rates of 20% and 15%, respectively.

**Abstract:**
Genetically modified, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising allogeneic source for the generation of functionally enhanced, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. However, the signaling of CARs during early T cell development and the removal of the endogenous T cell receptor required to prevent alloreactivity pose significant challenges to the production of mature conventional CAR T cells from iPSCs. Here, we show that TCR-null, CD8{beta} CAR T cells can be efficiently generated from iPSCs by engineering stage-specific onset of CAR expression and signaling to both permit conventional T cell development and to induce efficient positive selection. CAR T cells produced using this approach displayed a uniform, naive T cell phenotype and demonstrated superior antigen-specific cytotoxicity compared to iPSC-derived effector memory CAR T cells. Multimodal sequencing revealed CAR-mediated positive selection induced the persistent upregulation of key transcription factors involved in naive T cell development. Achieving precise control of CAR expression and signaling in developmentally sensitive T precursors will be critical to realizing the full potential for "off-the-shelf", iPSC-derived cellular therapies.

**Abstract:**
Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) provides high-resolution imaging and morphological information over large fields of view, while Computational Scattered Light Imaging (ComSLI) excels at mapping interwoven fiber organization in unstained tissue sections. This study introduces Fourier Ptychographic Scattered Light Microscopy (FP-SLM), a new multi-modal approach that combines FPM and ComSLI analyses to create both high-resolution phase-contrast images and fiber orientation maps from a single dataset. The method is demonstrated on a state-of-the-art setup that was originally used for FPM and one that was originally used for ComSLI, and the outputs are quantitatively compared to each other on brain sections (frog, monkey) and sections from thigh muscle and knee (mouse). FP-SLM delivers high-resolution images while revealing fiber organization in nerve, muscle, tendon, cartilage, and bone tissues. The approach is validated by comparing the computed fiber orientations with those derived from structure tensor analysis of the high-resolution images. The comparison shows that FPM and ComSLI are compatible with each other and yield fully consistent results. Remarkably, this combination surpasses the sum of its parts, so that applying ComSLI analysis to FPM recordings and vice-versa outperforms both methods alone. FP-SLM can be retrospectively applied to analyze any existing dataset acquired from a setup that was originally built for FPM or ComSLI alone (consisting of LED array and low numerical aperture), without need to build or design an extra setup. This significantly expands the application range of both techniques and enhances the study of complex tissue architectures in biomedical research.

**Abstract:**
Targeting of exocytosis enables cellular morphogenesis, motility and polarized transport, yet relatively little is known about the targeting mechanisms in cellular systems. Here we show that the SEC/MUNC protein KEULE is a dynamic marker for individual secretory events and employ it as a live cell probe, that together with high-precision image analysis of thousands of events, reveal that cortical microtubule arrays act as two-dimensional templates that pattern exocytosis at the nano-scale in higher plant cells. This mechanism is distinct from previously described mechanisms involving motor-driven transport and defines ordered and adjacent linear domains where secretory events are higher and lower than expected, effectively redistributing exocytosis over most of the cell membrane. In addition, analysis of KEULE kinetics revealed distinct phases of assembly/disassembly that are differentially sensitive to experimental treatments that reduce exocytosis, revealing SEC/MUNC dynamics as a versatile and information rich read-out of exocytosis in vivo.

**Abstract:**
Symbiotic systems of photosynthetic microorganisms and fungi are widespread in terrestrial biomes and lichens are probably the most advanced and complex. Conversely, the least complex systems are "green biofilms" with a completely unexplored mycobiome. We describe here a new system intermediate between green biofilms and lichens - semilichens. Light and fluorescence microscopy, eDNA sequencing, molecular phylogeny, Chlorophyll a fluorescence and 13C labelling/metabolomics were used to study algal and fungal identity, morphology and physiology of the symbiosis. Tight contact between algae and a single predominant fungus (mycobiont) is revealed in semilichens. The algae are from the symbiotic lineages of Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae, the fungi belong to Arthoniomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Lecanoromycetes and Lichinomycetes. Algae are alive and perform substantial photosynthetic activity. 13C labelled photosynthates are partially converted into specific fungal polyols (arabitol, mannitol) demonstrating the C-flow from algae to fungi. The new symbiotic system was defined and compared with other terrestrial algal-fungal symbioses. It is characterized by minimalist environmental requirements and extremely low production of biomass. As a result, it also inhabits environments unfavourable for lichens. Our research supports the hypothesis that the long-term existence of algae and fungi in terrestrial conditions affected by frequent and repeated drying is likely dependent on their mutual coexistence.

**Abstract:**
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins crucial to numerous diseases, yet many remain poorly characterized and untargeted by drugs. Chimeric GPCRs have emerged as valuable tools for elucidating GPCR function by facilitating the identification of signaling pathways, resolving structures, and discovering novel ligands of poorly understood GPCRs. Such chimeric GPCRs are obtained by merging a well- and less-well-characterized GPCR at the intracellular limits of their transmembrane regions or intracellular loops, leveraging knowledge transfer from the well-characterized GPCR. However, despite the 212 chimeric GPCRs engineered to date, the design process remains largely trial-and-error and lacks a standardized approach. To address this gap, we introduce GPCRchimeraDB (https://www.bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/), the first comprehensive database dedicated to chimeric GPCRs. It catalogs 212 chimeric receptors, identified through literature review, and includes 1,755 class A natural GPCRs, enabling connections between chimeras and their parent receptors while facilitating the exploration of novel parent combinations. Both chimeric and natural GPCR entries are extensively described at the sequence, structural, and biophysical level through a range of visualization tools, with annotations from resources like UniProt and GPCRdb and predictions from AlphaFold2 and b2btools. Additionally, GPCRchimeraDB offers a GPCR sequence aligner and a feature comparator to investigate differences between natural and chimeric receptors. It also provides design guidelines to support rational chimera engineering. GPCRchimeraDB is therefore a resource to facilitate and optimize the design of new chimeras, so helping to gain insights into poorly characterized receptors and contributing to advances in GPCR therapeutic development.

**Abstract:**
Cytoplasmic inclusions containing TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) are recognized as a major pathological feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Cyclophilin A (PPIA) interacts with TDP-43 and influences its aggregation and function. This interaction is facilitated by PPIA Lys-acetylation. We investigated the effect of lysine deacetylation inhibition to uncover the underlying mechanisms of TDP-43 proteinopathy in relation to PPIA acetylation, and to identify new therapeutic avenues. Through a screening of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in a cellular model of TDP-43 proteinopathy, we identified vorinostat/SAHA, capable of increasing PPIA acetylation, as the most effective in reversing TDP-43 mislocalization. We confirmed its effect in PBMCs from ALS patients and explored its impact on proteinopathy and PPIA acetylation in the Thy1-hTDP-43 mouse model. Thy1-hTDP-43 mice treated with SAHA showed a delayed onset of TDP-43 pathology, associated with PPIA nucleus-cytoplasm redistribution, lower neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, and improved neuromuscular function markers. However, the effect was only temporary. When combined with the heat shock protein (HSP) co-inducer arimoclomol, a mitigation of the neurodegeneration was sustained. A synergistic effect was observed in periphery, greatly enhancing tubulin acetylation and reducing pTDP-43 accumulation in the sciatic nerve and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) {gamma}-subunit expression in gastrocnemius muscle. This study suggests that HDAC inhibition, by increasing acetylated PPIA, could be beneficial in restoring TDP-43 localization and function. The combination of lysine deacetylation inhibition and HSP induction shows a synergistic effect in vivo and has potential as a therapeutic approach for patients.

**Abstract:**
Copious expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is associated with poor survival in many types of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia. We observed that a specific acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) cell line (6133) derived from RBM15-MKL1 knock-in mice exhibited heterogeneity in Prmt1 expression levels. Interestingly, only a subpopulation of 6133 cells expressing high levels of Prmt1 caused leukemia when transplanted into congenic mice. The PRMT1 inhibitor, MS023, effectively cured this PRMT1-driven leukemia. Seahorse analysis revealed that PRMT1 increased the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and decreased the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Consistently, PRMT1 accelerated glucose consumption and led to the accumulation of lactic acid in the leukemia cells. The metabolomic analysis supported that PRMT1 stimulated the intracellular accumulation of lipids, which was further validated by FACS analysis with BODIPY 493/503. In line with fatty acid accumulation, PRMT1 downregulated the protein level of CPT1A, which is involved in the rate-limiting step of fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, administering the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) delayed AMKL progression and promoted cell differentiation. Ectopic expression of Cpt1a rescued the proliferation of 6133 cells ectopically expressing PRMT1 in the glucose-minus medium. In conclusion, PRMT1 upregulates glycolysis and downregulates fatty acid oxidation to enhance the proliferation capability of AMKL cells.

**Abstract:**
Beta-arrestins are multifunctional regulators of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, orchestrating diverse downstream signaling events and physiological responses across the vast GPCR superfamily. While GPCR pharmacology has advanced to target orthosteric and allosteric sites, as well as G proteins and GRKs, comparable chemical tools to study beta-arrestins remain lacking. Here, we report the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors that selectively target beta-arrestins and delineate their mechanism of action through integrated pharmacological, biochemical, biophysical, and structural analyses. These inhibitors disrupt beta-arrestin-engagement with agonist-activated GPCRs, impairing desensitization, internalization, and beta-arrestin-dependent functions while sparing G protein-receptor coupling. Cryo-EM, MD simulations, and structure-guided mutagenesis reveal that one modulator, Cmpd-5, engages a cryptic pocket formed by the middle, C-, and lariat loops of beta-arrestin1-a critical receptor-binding interface-stabilizing a distinct conformation incompatible with GPCR engagement. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic framework for beta-arrestin modulation, introducing transducer-targeted strategies to fine-tune GPCR signaling and guide the development of pathway-specific therapeutics.

## Structural insights into heterohexameric assembly of epilepsy-related ligand-receptor complex LGI1-ADAM22

**Abstract:**
Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 protein (LGI1) is a secreted neuronal protein consisting of the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and C-terminal epitempin repeat (EPTP) domains. LGI1 is linked to epilepsy, a neurological disorder that can be caused by genetic mutations of genes regulating neuronal excitability (e.g., voltage- or ligand-gated ion channels). ADAM22 is a membrane receptor that binds to LGI1 extracellularly and interacts with AMPA-type glutamate receptors via PSD-95 intracellularly to maintain normal synaptic signal transmission. Structural analysis of the LGI1-ADAM22 complex is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of epileptogenesis and developing new therapies against epilepsy. We previously reported the crystal structure of a 2:2 complex consisting of two molecules of LGI1 and two molecules of the ADAM22 ectodomain (ECD), which is suggested to bridge neurons across the synaptic cleft. On the other hand, multiangle light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and cryo-EM analyses have suggested the existence of a 3:3 complex consisting of three molecules of LGI1 and three molecules of ADAM22. In the previous cryo-EM analysis, many observed particles were in a dissociated state, making it difficult to determine the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the 3:3 complex. In this study, we stabilized the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complex using chemical crosslinking and determined the cryo-EM structures of the LGI1LRR-LGI1EPTP-ADAM22ECD and 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complexes at 2.78 [A] and 3.79 [A] resolutions, respectively. Furthermore, high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) visualized the structural features and flexibility of the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complex in solution. We discuss new insights into the interaction modes of the LGI1-ADAM22 higher-order complex and the structural properties of the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22 complex.

**Abstract:**
Structural variation, involving large alterations in chromosome structure, drives genetic diversification and the emergence of new phenotypes. These changes are widespread in natural populations and play an important role in adaptation and speciation. For many species, research has been limited to laboratory adapted strains and experimental evolution, which may not reflect the diversity of structural variants in the wild. Furthermore, technological limitations have proved to be a major barrier to accurate and comprehensive variant calling. In this study, we used PacBio sequencing data from 14 wild Caenorhabditis elegans strains to characterize structural variants in a natural population. With long-reads, we overcame limitations associated with short-read approaches and leveraged population-level data to further refine the accuracy of variant calls. We found that large, rapidly evolving gene families, such as GPCR, F-Box, and C-Type lectin, were prominent among the variants predicted to have phenotypic consequences. These results shed light on the significant role of structural variants in the evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans in its wild habitats and the limitations of treating N2 as the reference wild-type.

**Abstract:**
Aims: To standardise and automate the quantitation of human-unique neuromelanin granules in catecholamine neurons in post-mortem tissue sections from healthy individuals at different ages to understand any changes in these granules with age. Methods: 5-6m thick fixed and paraffin-embedded transverse midbrain tissue sections were supplied from 47 cases from three brain banks following ethics approvals. Sections were prepared and automated digital images acquired. Standardisation and automation of the quantification of neuromelanin granules was performed using the TruAI feature of the Olympus VS200 desktop platform. Comparisons between stained and unstained sections as well as correlations with age were performed. Results: The automated platform reliably identified both stained and unstained intracellular and extracellular neuromelanin granules, showing high reproducibility in measurements across laboratories using different tissue processing methods. Extracellular neuromelanin granules were significantly smaller than intracellular neuromelanin granules. Sections processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining impacted on size and colour of both neuromelanin and the neurons containing neuromelanin. Hematoxylin made neuromelanin bluer and the increased tissue processing made the intracellular area occupied by neuromelanin smaller in younger people. There was an increase in neuromelanin optical density and colour change (more brown) with age. Conclusions: The TruAI automated platform reliably quantifies individual neuromelanin granules in catecholamine neurons. Extracellular neuromelanin is considerably smaller in size than intracellular neuromelanin, and intracellular neuromelanin changes its properties with age. The darkening and colour change of intracellular neuromelanin suggests an increase in eumelanin over time in healthy individuals. These changes can be reliably identified using the automated platform.

## The brain dynamics of congenitally blind people seeing faces and letters via sound

**Abstract:**
Sensory substitution devices (SSDs) convert images to sounds to equip blind individuals with nominally visual functions, like face or letter sensitivity. Prior studies showed that image-to-sound SSDs engage cortices ordinarily specialised for visual functions. However, the brain dynamics of SSD-supported perception remains unknown. Either visual cortices are the first locus of discrimination of SSD percepts, or their activation is a byproduct of perceptual processes unfurling elsewhere, such as in auditory cortices. Resolving this uncertainty is critical for understanding the contribution of visual cortices to mechanisms subserving SSD-induced perceptions in the blind. Using electrical neuroimaging of EEG data from congenitally blind adults, we show for the first time that visual cortices are the earliest site of face and letter sensitivity when conveyed via SSDs, though with distinct temporal dynamics and spatial localizations. In the case of faces versus scrambled faces, differences first manifested at 460ms post-stimulus onset as topographic EEG modulations that were in turn localized to a network of right-hemisphere regions, including the fusiform face area (FFA) as well as lateral occipital cortices. In the case of discerning vertically versus horizontally oriented letter shapes, differences first manifested at 370ms post-stimulus onset as topographic EEG modulations that were localized to a network of left-hemisphere regions, including the occipital pole and the occipito-temporal junction extending into the angular gyrus. Notably, early-latency auditory evoked potentials did not differ based on visual properties of the soundscapes. These collective data support the proposition that responses to soundscapes are routed to brain circuits ordinarily specialized for processing visual information and that these circuits are the loci of the initial discriminant processes. By providing the temporal dynamics of SSD perception, our findings provide unique evidence for the theory that cortices are characterised by task-contingent functional organisation.

**Abstract:**
The nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR) required for cell death (NRC) family represents a group of helper NLRs that are required by sensor NLRs to execute hypersensitive cell death during pathogen infection. NRCs contain an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain essential for their function, yet our knowledge of how this domain contributes to NRC function remains limited. Here, we identified a novel hydrophobic feature within the CC domain that contributes to NRC-mediated immunity. We screened for conserved hydrophobic residues among NRCs and identified seven required for NRC4-mediated cell death. Structural analysis revealed that four of these residues form a hydrophobic core in the CC domain. This hydrophobic core is important for NRC4 subcellular localization, oligomerization, and phospholipid association, but not for NRC4 focal accumulation at the extrahaustorial membrane during Phytophthora infestans infection. Sequence analysis and functional assays revealed this core is highly conserved in NRCs and some singleton NLRs but has degenerated in NRC-dependent sensor NLRs. Our study identifies a novel hydrophobic feature in the CC domain of NRCs and reveals its contribution to NLR-mediated immunity.

**Abstract:**
Macrophages are a highly plastic innate immune cell subset that depends on environmental cues to activate, execute and resolve inflammatory responses. This plasticity of function is mirrored by the diversity of RNA modifications that dynamically decorate macrophage transcripts. Here, using the mouse macrophage line RAW 264.7 (RAW), we addressed the combinatorial effect of two major mRNA modifications: adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) deamination by ADAR1 and adenosine N6-methylation (m6A) by METTL3. Using both short-read and single molecule sequencing on RAW macrophages with genetic deletions of ADAR1 or METTL3, we identified transcripts that were modified by both enzymes, with specific functional outcomes on macrophage activation. While m6A levels remained relatively stable even in the absence of ADAR1, loss of METTL3 led to a global reduction in A-to-I editing levels. This interrelation was most apparent when m6A sites were distant from sites of deamination, suggesting a possible function of m6A in ADAR1-mediated editing. Using a dual reporter cell line where guided ADAR1 recruitment can be measured via eGFP reactivation, we observed that m6A modification of ADAR-engager guide RNAs substantially improved targeted RNA editing. Overall, we report the first example of an interdependence between modifications, which can also be therapeutically exploited.

**Abstract:**
Assessment of pharmacological intervention on in vitro neural systems often emphasizes molecular and structural changes. However, neural systems fundamentally process and act on information. For preclinical assays to predict drug efficacy, they must model these physiological functions. DishBrain, an in vitro synthetic biological intelligence (SBI) assay embodying a neural system in a simulated game-world, enables the quantification of this information-processing capacity, however the question remains whether such a system permits classical pharmacological interrogation and dose-response profiling. Hyperactive glutamatergic dysregulation is linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy, and inducible overexpression of neurogenin 2 (NGN2) in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) generates glutamatergic cultures with dysregulated hyperactivity. We therefore tested three anti-seizure medications (ASMs), phenytoin, perampanel, and carbamazepine, on NGN2 neurons from day 21 of differentiation in this system. The key finding was that, while all compounds altered spontaneous firing, carbamazepine 200 {micro}M significantly improved gameplay metrics. This marks the first demonstration of altered SBI following exogenous drug treatment. Notably, only inhibitory compounds enhanced goal-directed activity, linking glutamatergic attenuation to performance. Neurocomputational analysis revealed nuanced pharmacological responses during closed-loop stimulation, highlighting insights beyond spontaneous activity metrics.

## AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is essential for tendon homeostasis and prevents premature senescence and ectopic calcification

**Abstract:**
Tendinopathy is a debilitating tendon disorder affecting millions of people, characterized by pain, swelling, and diminished biomechanical properties. While the precise mechanisms underlying tendon homeostasis remain unclear, metabolic regulation plays a critical role. In this study, we combine transcriptomic analysis of human tendinopathic samples with a conditional mouse model in which Prkaa1 (encoding AMPK1) is selectively deleted in tendon progenitors to elucidate the role of AMPK signaling in tendon homeostasis. RNA sequencing of diseased human tendons revealed downregulation of key metabolic genes, including several involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and AMPK signaling pathways, alongside an increase in markers associated with senescence and a secretory inflammatory profile. In parallel, mice with loss of Prkaa1 function exhibited normal postnatal development; however, by one month of age, tendons demonstrated widespread transcriptional alterations related to cell cycle regulation and ECM organization. By three months, AMPK1-deficient tendons showed significant reductions in mechanical strength and increased expression of senescence markers p21 and p16, progressing to prominent ectopic calcification with age. In vitro studies further confirmed that tendon fibroblasts lacking AMPK1 have altered ECM substrate adhesion profiles. Importantly, voluntary exercise partially rescued these deficits by enhancing ECM organization and reducing senescence marker expression. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that AMPK1 is critical for maintaining energy balance, regulating ECM remodeling, and preventing premature cellular senescence in tendon. These insights highlight AMPK signaling as a promising therapeutic target and underscore the beneficial role of exercise in mitigating tendinopathic changes.

**Abstract:**
Chronic unhealthy sleeping behaviours are a major risk factor for the emergence of mood and anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, we are still lacking understanding why some individuals are more prone than others to affective dysregulation caused by sleep disruption. With preliminary evidence suggesting that brain activity during positive and negative emotional processing might play an important modulating role, we conducted whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses in a large cohort of healthy young adults (N = 155). Using regions consistently affected in insomnia disorder as seeds, we investigated sleep quality-related neural connectivity patterns that were both insensitive and sensitive to the interactions with individual measures of reward and punishment processing, additionally assessing the links with indices of emotional health. The majority of the findings reflected interactions between sleep quality and reinforcement sensitivity, with the opposite associations reported in the good and poor sleepers. One of such connections, the coupling between precentral gyrus and posterior insula, was additionally negatively linked to trait anxiety, with the lowest connectivity values observed in poor sleepers with higher sensitivity to punishment. In turn, the only finding associated solely with sleep quality, i.e. coupling between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus, was also related to the habitual use of emotion suppression strategies. As such, the present study provides evidence that reinforcement sensitivity plays an essential role in understanding the associations of poor sleep quality with brain connectivity and emotional health, hinting at a potential link that may help explain individual differences in susceptibility to sleep-related affective dysregulation.

**Abstract:**
Somatic structural variations (SVs) are critical genomic alterations in cancer genomes. Long-read sequencing (LRS) is theoretically optimal for detecting somatic SVs. However, influenced by reads-to-reference alignment errors, particularly in low-complexity or highly repetitive genomic intervals, current LRS-based somatic SV callers fail to accurately detect SVs. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive ground-truth datasets hinders accurate evaluation. Here, we introduce SVscope, a novel algorithm that fundamentally addresses these challenges by leveraging full-length sequence information from span-reads and integrating local graph-genome optimization with a random forest strategy. SVscope outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six paired long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) benchmark cell lines, achieving a maximum F1-score improvement of 16.7%. In simulated datasets, SVscope demonstrates superior performance in both somatic SV detection and read phasing tasks. Based on the findings from SVscope, we validated 47 somatic SVs, thereby significantly expanding the existing experimentally validated ground-truth somatic SV dataset by 69.1%.

**Abstract:**
Plasmodium falciparum Pfs230 and Pfs48/45, part of a core fertilization complex, are leading malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates. However, how the two proteins interact is unknown. Here we report a 3.36 [A] resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the endogenous Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex. We show that Pfs48/45 interacts with Pfs230 domains 13 and 14, domains that are not included in current Pfs230 vaccine immunogens. Using a transgenic parasite line with a domain 13 to 14 deletion, we show that these domains are essential for Pfs230 localization on the gamete surface. Furthermore, this line significantly reduced oocyst formation in the mosquito midgut, showing that the presence of Pfs230 domains 13 and 14 is critical for successful fertilization. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibit Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation, reduce transmission and structural analyses reveal their binding epitopes. Furthermore, domains 13 and 14 are targets of naturally acquired immunity and when delivered as mRNA-LNP immunizations induce potent immune responses and blocked transmission of malaria parasites. Our comprehensive structural insights on a core P. falciparum fertilization complex will guide the design of novel transmission-blocking vaccine candidates against malaria.

**Abstract:**
The Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) is the most ubiquitous protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane. This channel facilitates the flux of water-soluble metabolites and ions like calcium across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Beyond this canonical role, VDAC has been implicated, through interactions with protein partners, in several cellular processes such as apoptosis, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. There are three VDAC isoforms in mammalian cells, VDAC 1, 2, and 3, with varying tissue-specific expression profiles. From a biophysical standpoint, all three isoforms can conduct metabolites and ions with similar efficiency. However, isoform knockouts (KOs) in mice lead to distinct phenotypes, which may be due to differences in VDAC isoform interactions with partner proteins. To understand the functional role of each VDAC isoform within a single cell type, we created functional KOs of each isoform in HeLa cells and performed a comparative study of their metabolic activity and proteomics. We found that each isoform KO alters the proteome differently, with VDAC3 KO dramatically downregulating key members of the electron transport chain (ETC) while shifting the mitochondria into a glutamine-dependent state. Importantly, this unexpected dependence of mitochondrial function on the VDAC3 isoform is not compensated by the more ubiquitously expressed VDAC1 and VDAC2 isoforms. In contrast, VDAC2 KO did not affect respiration but upregulated ETC components and decreased key enzymes in the glutamine metabolic pathway. VDAC1 KO specifically reduced glycolytic activity linked to decreased hexokinase localization to mitochondria. These results reveal non-redundant roles of VDAC isoforms in cancer cell metabolic adaptability.

**Abstract:**
Calcineurin is a highly conserved phosphatase that plays a central role in sensing calcium and governing transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational signaling networks. Calcineurin is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic A subunit and a regulatory B subunit. Through downstream effectors, calcineurin signaling drives myriad responses in different organisms. In the fungal pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex that infects humans, calcineurin governs thermotolerance and is essential for growth at high temperature and pathogenesis. In Cryptococcus deneoformans, the underlying molecular functions of this critical signaling cascade are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a genetic screen and identified genetic changes that suppress the requirement for calcineurin during high-temperature growth. Our results identified two mechanisms that bypass the requirement for calcineurin function. The first mechanism involves segmental aneuploidy via both amplification as well as loss of chromosome fragments. The second mechanism involves dominant amino acid substitution mutations in the genes encoding three proteins, Chs6, Imp2, and Cts1, orthologs of components of the Ingression Progression Complex required for septation and budding in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Loss of calcineurin activity causes chitin and chitosan accumulation and severe budding defects, whereas suppressor mutations largely restore growth and cytokinesis in the absence of calcineurin. These findings reveal the calcineurin signaling cascade controls a conserved cytokinesis machinery at the mitotic exit network during thermal stress.

**Abstract:**
As we listen to speech, our brains actively compute the meaning of individual words. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we hypothesized that the brain employs vectorial coding principles, such that meaning is reflected in distributed activity of single neurons. We recorded responses of hundreds of neurons in the human hippocampus, which has a well-established role in semantic coding, while participants listened to narrative speech. We find encoding of contextual word meaning in the simultaneous activity of neurons whose individual selectivities span multiple unrelated semantic categories. Like embedding vectors in semantic models, distance between neural population responses correlates with semantic distance; however, this effect was only observed in contextual embedding models (like BERT) and was reversed in non-contextual embedding models (like Word2Vec), suggesting that the semantic distance effect depends critically on contextualization. Moreover, for the subset of highly semantically similar words, even contextual embedders showed an inverse correlation between semantic and neural distances; we attribute this pattern to the noise-mitigating benefits of contrastive coding. Finally, in further support for the critical role of context, we find that range of neural responses covaries with lexical polysemy. Ultimately, these results support the hypothesis that semantic coding in the hippocampus follows vectorial principles.

## Hyperreflexia after corticospinal tract lesion reflects 1A afferent circuit changes not increased KCC2 hyperexcitability

**Abstract:**
Hyperreflexia is a consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI) and motor system lesions in the brain Two major mechanisms underpinning hyperreflexia have been reported: proprioceptive afferent (PA) circuit changes produced by 1A fiber sprouting, which could enhance reflex signaling, together with reduced GABAergic inhibitory presynaptic regulation (GABApre); and increased intrinsic motor neuron excitability, for example, produced by reduced motor neuron membrane-bound potassium-chloride co-transporter2 (KCC2). Here we examine how selective unilateral CST injury in the medullary pyramid (PTX), which eliminates the CST from one hemisphere, allows for specific investigation of the different mechanisms to determine their contributions to hyperreflexia. We used rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the Hoffmann (H)-reflex for the forelimb and hindlimb 5th-digit abductor muscles to assess hyperreflexia on both the contra-and ipsilesional sides. We compared RDD in naive and unilateral-PTX rats at 7-dpi and 42-dpi, supplemented with additional timepoints to examine hyperreflexia development.

Immunohistochemistry was used to identify PA synapses (VGlut1), GABA presynaptic boutons (GABApre), motor neurons (ChAT), and to measure KCC2. Following unilateral PTX, we observed significant hyperreflexia in the contralesional forelimb only. Membrane-bound KCC2 was unchanged in contralesional cervical motor neurons. Whereas both cervical and lumbar motor neurons showed increased PA sprouting contralesionally, there was a concomitant increase in GABApre terminals for the lumbar not cervical cord, which associated with a normal hindlimb H-reflex. Our findings show that KCC2 is disassociated from hyperreflexia in the uniPTX model. Instead, forelimb hyperreflexia can be explained by cervical motor neuron PA sprouting and an uncompensated GABApre regulation.

**Abstract:**
Fluorescent imaging enables visualization of the specific molecules of interest with high contrast, and the use of multiple fluorophores in a single tissue sample allows visualization of complex relationships between biological molecules, cell types, and anatomy. The utility of fluorescent imaging in human tissue has been limited by endogenous pigments that can block the light path or emit an autofluorescence, thereby interfering with the specific imaging of target molecules. Although photobleachers have been developed to quench endogenous pigments, the lack of customizability limits their utility for a broad range of applications. Here, we present a high luminous-intensity photobleacher that is based on rigorous simulations of illumination patterns using the laws of radiation, along with the framework to maximize bleaching efficiency. This open-source project is designed to help researchers customize and scale according to the tissue types and the research goals. The photobleacher is applicable to both thin tissue slices and large-volume cleared tissue samples to enable serial three-dimensional imaging of postmortem human brain using multiplexed antibody or oligonucleotide probes.

**Abstract:**
We present the first causal evidence in the healthy human brain linking the central thalamus to vigilance and the pulvinar to visuospatial attention using low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS). In a within-subjects, counterbalanced design, 27 healthy volunteers completed the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), a vigilance task, and the Egly-Driver Task (EDT), which assesses visuospatial attention, before and after central thalamus, pulvinar, and sham sonication with tFUS. Central thalamic sonication significantly impaired performance on both tasks in a manner consistent with decreases in arousal. Targeting the pulvinar with tFUS resulted in more subtle changes in visuospatial attention. Participants were less reactive to visual stimuli presented in the visual field contralateral to the affected pulvinar. These results demonstrate that tFUS can elicit measurable behavioral changes in healthy volunteers and underscores its potential as a high-resolution tool for non-invasive brain mapping, capable of differentiating functional contributions of thalamic regions only millimeters apart.

**Abstract:**
Intratumor transcriptional heterogeneity (ITTH) presents a major challenge in cancer treatment, particularly due to limited understanding of the diverse malignant cell populations and their relationship to therapy resistance. While single-cell sequencing has provided valuable insights into tumor composition, its high cost and technical complexity limits its use for large-scale tumor screening. In contrast, several databases collecting bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from multiple samples across various cancer types are available and could be used to profile ITTH. Several deconvolution approaches have been developed to infer cellular composition from such data. However, most of these methods rely on predefined markers or single cell reference datasets, limiting the performance of such methods by the quality of used reference data. Although unsupervised approaches do not face such limitations, existing methods have not been specifically adapted to characterize malignant cell states, and focus instead on general cell types. To address these gaps, we introduce CDState, an unsupervised method for inferring malignant cell subpopulations from bulk RNA-seq data. CDState utilizes a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization model improved with sum-to-one constraints and a cosine similarity-based optimization to deconvolve bulk gene expression into distinct cell state-specific profiles, and estimate the abundance of each state across tumor samples. We validate CDState using bulkified single-cell RNA-seq data from five cancer types, showing that it outperforms existing unsupervised deconvolution methods in both cell state proportions and gene expression estimation. Applying CDState to 33 cancer types from TCGA, we identified recurrent malignant cell programs, with epithelial-mesenchymal transition as the main driver of tumor transcriptional heterogeneity. We further link the identified malignant states to patient clinical features, revealing states associated with worse patient prognosis. We show that ITTH is linked with patient survival and clinical features, as well as is associated with varied responses to therapy. Finally, we identified potential genetic drivers of ITTH and malignant cell states, including TP53, KRAS, and PIK3CA, known oncogenic genes.

**Abstract:**
Deep learning methods have been developed to predict gene expression levels across various cell and tissue types based on DNA-binding sites of protein identified by ChIP-seq. However, the experimental identification of DNA/RNA-binding sites and the functional characterization of certain proteins remain challenging. Here I predicted the regulatory target genes and functional roles of DNA/RNA-binding proteins using gene co-expression data. Gene co-expression correlations are derived from gene expression profiles across cells and tissues and represent interactions between a DNA/RNA-binding protein and other genes. I used these interactions to predict gene expression levels by partially replacing the input data in the deep learning analysis. Functional annotations statistically overrepresented in the predicted target genes of ten DNA/RNA-binding proteins examined in this study were consistent with their known biological roles. Furthermore, several annotations not present in current gene function databases were supported by findings in previously published studies.

**Abstract:**
Tinnitus, the perception of sound without an external source, affects a significant portion of the population, yet its impact on brain communication diagram known as the functional connectome, remains limited. Traditional functional connectivity (FC) methods, such as Pearson correlation, phase lag index and coherence rely on pairwise comparisons and are therefore limited in providing a holistic encoding of FC. Here, we employ an alternative approach to estimate the entire connectivity structure by analyzing all time-courses simultaneously. This approach is robust even for short-duration recordings, facilitating faster functional connectome identification and real-time applications. Using resting-state MEG recordings from controls and individuals with tinnitus, we demonstrated that the learned connectomes outperform correlation-based connectomes in fingerprinting, that is, identifying an individual from test-retest acquisitions. Group-level analysis revealed distinct altered FC in tinnitus across multiple frequency bands, affecting the default mode, auditory, visual, and salience networks, suggesting a reorganization of these large-scale networks beyond auditory areas. Our study reveals that tinnitus presents highly individualized and heterogeneous whole-brain connectome profiles, highlighting the need to focus on individual variability rather than group-level differences to gain a more nuanced understanding of tinnitus. Personalized FC could enable patient-specific tinnitus models, optimizing treatment strategies for individualized care.

**Abstract:**
Influenza continues to pose significant global health threats, hijacking host cellular machinery through protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are fundamental to viral entry, replication, immune evasion, and transmission. Yet, our understanding of these host-virus PPIs remains incomplete due to the vast diversity of viral proteins, their rapid mutation rates, and the limited availability of experimentally validated interaction data. Additionally, existing computational methods often struggle due to the limited availability of high-quality samples and their inability to effectively model the complex nature of host-virus interactions. To address these challenges, we present SEHI-PPI, an end-to-end framework for human-influenza PPI prediction. SEHI-PPI integrates a double-view deep learning architecture that captures both global and local sequence features, coupled with a novel adaptive negative sampling strategy to generate reliable and high-quality negative samples. Our method outperforms multiple benchmarks, including state-of-the-art large language models, achieving a superior performance in sensitivity (0.986) and AUROC (0.987). Notably, in a stringent test involving entirely unseen human and influenza protein families, SEHI-PPI maintains strong performance with an AUROC of 0.837. The model also demonstrates high generalizability across other human-virus PPI datasets, with an average sensitivity of 0.929 and AUROC of 0.928. Furthermore, AlphaFold3-guided case studies reveal that viral proteins predicted to target the same human protein cluster together structurally and functionally, underscoring the biological relevance of our predictions. These discoveries demonstrate the reliability of our SEHI-PPI framework in uncovering biologically meaningful host-virus interactions and potential therapeutic targets.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

**Abstract:**
Despite intensive study, gaps remain in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to limited contextual metadata accompanying most large genomic surveillance datasets. We analyzed over 130,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, over 85,000 with matched epidemiological data, collected in Massachusetts from November 2021 to January 2023, to investigate viral transmission dynamics at high resolution. The data were drawn from diagnostic testing at >600 facilities representing schools, workplaces, public testing, and other sectors, and encompass the emergence of six major viral lineages, each representing a new outbreak. We found urban areas as key hubs for new lineage introduction and interurban transmission as facilitating spread throughout the state. Young adults, especially those on college campuses, served as early indicators of emerging lineage dominance. Resident-aged populations in college campuses and nursing homes exhibited a higher likelihood of being linked to within-facility transmission, while staff-aged at those facilities were more linked to their surrounding community. Individuals with recent vaccine doses, including boosters, had a lower likelihood of initiating transmission. This dataset shows the value of linking genomic and epidemiologic data at scale for higher resolution insights into viral dynamics and their implication for public health strategy.

**Abstract:**
IntroductionPneumonia is a leading cause of under-five mortality, with 30 million annual cases in India. Despite national guidelines, significant barriers to timely and appropriate care-seeking persist. Caregivers often face financial constraints, lack of awareness, mistrust in government facilities, and a preference for non-registered medical practitioners (non-RMP), delaying effective treatment. This study explores care-seeking behaviors, associated sociodemographic factors, and barriers to access to appropriate healthcare for childhood pneumonia in rural India.

MethodsThis study is part of a broader implementation research (IR) initiative and represents its formative phase. This mixed-methods study was conducted in Palwal district, Haryana, covering 42 villages (population: 107,440). A cross-sectional survey identified suspected pneumonia cases among 9,593 under-five children through house-to-house visits using a structured checklist. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, health insurance, care-seeking patterns, and provider preferences were collected. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) identified potential confounders in the association between care-seeking behaviour and key exposure variables. Additionally, qualitative in-depth interviews explored caregivers perceptions, decision-making, and healthcare barriers to pneumonia management. Quantitative data were analysed using logistic regression, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed using the Three Delays Model. Suspected under-five pneumonia cases caregivers and families were actively engaged in this formative phase to inform Phase II implementation strategies of broader IR, ensuring community-driven and contextually relevant strategies.

ResultsAmong 231 suspected pneumonia cases, 97% of caregivers sought medical care, but 71% consulted non-RMPs, and only 3.6% visited government facilities. Seeking appropriate care was associated with higher maternal education (AOR 6.5, 95% CI: 2.7, 9.7) and higher wealth index (AOR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.6). Thematic analysis revealed delays due to symptom misinterpretation, reliance on home remedies, financial constraints, gender biases, mistrust in public healthcare services, and logistical barriers.

ConclusionDespite high care-seeking rates, provider preferences, socio-cultural factors, and systemic barriers delay appropriate pneumonia treatment. Addressing these challenges requires improving awareness, enhancing public healthcare trust, and strengthening frontline health worker engagement. This study underscores the role of structured beneficiary involvement in refining pneumonia management strategies to ensure sustainable, community-driven interventions.

**Abstract:**
Psychedelics have garnered great attention in recent years as treatments for major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression due to their ability to alter consciousness and afflicted cognitive processes with lasting effects. Given these unique characteristics and the urgent need for efficacious treatments, psychedelics are being tested for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite promising results and growing interest, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics remain uncharacterized. Using a scoping review approach, we summarize current clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov that utilize classic psychedelics as interventions for SUDs with the goal of understanding the current state and outlook of the field. A second scoping review was conducted using PubMed and SCOPUS databases to identify the relevant publications addressing the pharmacotherapeutic potential of restoring dopamine homeostasis as a novel neurobiological mechanism of psychedelics. This mechanism may blunt drug-seeking behavior, promote drug abstinence, and underlie their clinical relevance for SUD in addition to previously characterized mechanisms.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundThe World Health Organization recommends perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), generally using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to children at high risk of severe P. falciparum malaria. Currently, PMC is given up to age two in perennial transmission settings. However, no recommendation exists for perennial settings with seasonal variation in transmission intensity, recently categorized as  sub-perennial. Tailored chemoprevention strategies are needed to protect children during seasons and ages of highest malaria risk. The seasonal dimension must adequately cover seasonally increased risk periods, alongside interventions that address year-round, lower intensity transmission. We propose a hybrid malaria chemoprevention (HMC) strategy, integrating two delivery components: 1) existing PMC, and 2) additional monthly SP doses during the higher-risk rainy season, ensuring a one-month gap between any two doses.

MethodsUsing a validated individual-based malaria model combined with pharmacological models of drug action (OpenMalaria), we examined the potential public health impact of the proposed HMC (for children 03-24 months), and an age-expanded HMC (referred to as HMC+, for children 03-36 months), under different drug sensitivity, coverage, and prevalence (5-70%) assumptions.

ResultsHMC and HMC+ demonstrated a median (interquartile range) of 2.1 (1.6-2.6), 2.9 (2.2-3.6) times higher efficacy (relative fold increase in burden averted) compared to only PMC against clinical, and 2.0 (0.6-3.4), 3.3 (0.8-5.8) against severe cases, respectively, in children under age three. This led to a median protective efficacy of 31.8% (25.4-38.2%), 44.9% (36.9-52.9%) against clinical, and 16.1% (7.0-25.2%), 26.4% (14.4-38.4%) against severe cases by HMC and HMC+ respectively, across the prevalence, drug sensitivity, and coverage assumptions. We found positive net impact for children under age five years, outweighing a limited potential of delayed malaria across settings.

ConclusionSubstantially increased public health benefits might be achieved by adding seasonally-targeted chemoprevention to current PMC in sub-perennial malaria transmission settings. Effectiveness-implementation studies should generate empirical evidence of public health impact including on the disease burden averted, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the hybrid approach. Such studies should also explore determinants of implementation success including operational feasibility, and acceptability of proposed dosing strategies which will facilitate deployment decisions.

**Abstract:**
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes significant morbidity, mortality, and growthth faltering among children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. While gut inflammation contributes to growth faltering, the role of ETEC in inflammation remains poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that ETEC-producing heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxins (ST) induced significant inflammation in humans, but LT-only strains are understudied. In this study, we evaluated the intestinal inflammation induced by the LT-only ETEC strain LSN03-016011/A in a human challenge model. Stool samples were analyzed for pre- and post-challenge myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines, ETEC shedding, and ETEC-specific antibody responses. MPO, IL-1{beta}, and IL-8 levels significantly increased post-ETEC challenge, but there was no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Participants protected from severe diarrhea had higher levels of pre-challenge IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-{gamma} compared to those not protected. The MPO and specific cytokine levels were significantly correlated with the seroconversion status to LT and the colonization factor antigen CS17. This study provides evidence that LT-ETEC strain can induce significant intestinal inflammation even in the absence of symptoms, highlighting the need for a vaccine and a better understanding of the impact of ETEC-attributable inflammation on child health in endemic areas.

Author summaryEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of enteric infections, resulting in diarrhea, malnutrition, and other long-term health effects. However, how ETEC - particularly strains that produce only the heat-labile toxin (LT) - can contribute to gut inflammation is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the impact of an LT-ETEC infection on gut inflammation and its relations to ETEC-specific immune responses using samples from participants in a controlled human infection study. We found that LT-ETEC induces a significant level of gut inflammation marker myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1{beta}, when the patients had moderate to severe diarrhea and even when diarrheal symptoms were mild or absent. Gut inflammation level correlated with immune responses to ETEC. These findings suggest that LT-ETEC infection causes significant gut inflammation, which plays a role in immune responses. Our results highlight the need for preventive strategies to reduce the burden of ETEC-related illness, particularly in regions where these infections are common, to prevent broader adverse consequences for gut health and child development.

**Abstract:**
Similarities between mental symptoms in Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and those in Post-COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PCVS) have been observed. Based on a representative survey of the population aged 18 to 69 years in Germany (n = 4,628), the epidemiologies of both PCS and PCVS were studied. Mental symptoms of PCS (fatigue/exhaustion/weakness, reduced performance, concentration and memory problems, sleep disorders and depressed mood) were reported by 12.1% and mental symptoms of PCVS were reported by 12.6% of all respondents. Concerning PCS, mental symptoms were reported more often by females compared to males (13.5% versus 10.7%), whereas no gender differences were found for PCVS. With the increasing number of booster vaccinations, mental PCVS decreased from 20.8% with one vaccination to 8.9% with four or more vaccinations. Overall, non-mRNA vaccines did not lead significantly to more mental symptoms than mRNA vaccines (12.9% versus 12.5%) but did differ concerning mental symptom patterns: concentration and memory problems (8.2% versus 3.3%), impaired performance (5.7% versus 4.2%) and sleep disorders (6.6% versus 3.2%) were reported more frequently in non-mRNA vaccines. The reported rate of mental PCVS being 12.6% is clearly higher than the 0.5% recorded by official documentation systems (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI)), suggesting a major underreporting. The data indicate that mental symptoms occurring in both PCS and PCVS are common, making the differential diagnosis between PCS and PCVS, as well as between both PCS and PCVS and independent mental disorders such as depressive disorders, an important but challenging task.

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Infectious diseases, also known as communicable disease or transmissible disease is illness that is caused due to pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. One of such infection is caused by zoonotic virus (bat-borne) known as Nipah virus (NiV). NiV is one of the worlds deadliest viruses leading to highest mortality rates. It is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to category C priority pathogen that belongs to genus Hepanivirus, and family Paramyxoviridae. The first occurrence of NiV was observed in Malaysia-Singapore during 1998-1999 and the most recent outbreak in Kozhikode district of Kerala in 2018.

Currently, no drugs or vaccines specific to NiV have proven to yield effective outcome at advanced stage of the disease. However, some therapies involving antiviral drug like Ribavirin along with other medicines have shown to recover patients, reducing the death rate by 36%. Due to extensive research various therapeutic strategies have been proven to successfully target the viral infection during the early stages in animal models. Several vaccines have been under investigation and clinical trials serving as a promising approach towards effective and safe vaccine in both livestock animals and humans.

This study underscores the essential contributions shaping the academic discourse in nipah virus research, bringing to light the most influential studies within the co-citation and co-occurrence network analysis. By identifying the keywords, we gain valuable insights into the foundational research driving advancements in this research area. The detailed mapping of the co-citation network further illuminates the interconnectedness of various research themes and the collaborative efforts that boost the field of nipah virus research in different horizons. The recognition of influential studies not only highlights the depth and breadth of scholarly engagement but also provides a roadmap for future research endeavours.

**Abstract:**
Background We aimed to estimate the burden of antibiotic-nonsusceptible non-bacteremic pneumonia and sinusitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in US adults ([&ge;]18 years). Methods We estimated antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococcal sinusitis and non-bacteremic pneumonia incidence as products of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates, serotype distribution, and serotype-specific antimicrobial nonsusceptibility prevalences by antibiotic class and guideline-recommended agents from 2016-2019. We derived pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates from national healthcare utilization surveys and administrative datasets; pneumococcal-attributable attributable percents and serotype distributions from published data; and serotype-specific nonsusceptibility estimates from Active Bacterial Core surveillance data. We evaluated nonsusceptibility for all serotypes and those targeted by 15-, 20- and 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15/20/21). Results An estimated 16.4% (95% confidence interval 12.8-21.4%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 19.0% (14.8-24.9%) of sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes, translating to 243,521 (179,673-333,675) and 1,844,726 (1,070,763-2,904,089) outpatient visits for pneumonia and sinusitis, respectively, and 10,155 (7,542-13,803) pneumonia hospitalizations annually. An estimated 31.2% (26.6-36.3%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 10.5% (9.4-12.0%) of pneumococcal sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]1 outpatient first-line antibiotic agent. Cases attributable to serotypes targeted by PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21 that were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes accounted for 7.4% (4.7-11.1%), 8.5% (5.8-12.1%), and 12.6% (9.2-17.5%) of all non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia cases, and 8.4% (5.3-12.5%), 9.4% (6.2-13.4), and 14.4% (10.4-20.0%) of all pneumococcal sinusitis cases. Conclusions We demonstrated high proportions of antibiotic nonsusceptibility in non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis in US adults. PCVs and antibiotic stewardship may mitigate antibiotic nonsusceptibility in pneumococcal disease.

**Abstract:**
Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a promising non-invasive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), though significant variability exists in patient responses. This quadruple-blind, sham-controlled crossover randomized clinical trial investigated whether clinical improvement was influenced by the spatial selection of stimulation sites or early cardiac rhythm modulations. Seventy-five MDD patients (33 women) were randomized to either personalized stimulation sites, identified via the strongest negative functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the default mode network (DMN), or fixed stimulation at the F3 position of the 10-20 EEG system. Electrocardiograms throughout stimulation monitored heart rate and its variability, focusing on heartbeat deceleration (RR slope) and changes in the root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats (RMSSD). Findings demonstrated that a higher RR slope within the first 45 seconds of stimulation predicted greater clinical improvement at six weeks, while a lower RMSSD change during the first 270 seconds correlated with improvement at one week. However, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between personalized and fixed stimulation sites. This study identified a significant relationship between early heart rhythm modulations and the antidepressant effects of accelerated iTBS in MDD. Although the spatial determination of stimulation sites did not enhance clinical improvement, iTBS-induced changes in cardiac rhythm during early sessions may develop into valuable biomarkers for stratifying patients, enabling more personalized and effective treatment strategies in the future.

**Abstract:**
In 2024, the Americas region experienced the largest dengue outbreak on record and Brazil was among the worst affected countries, reporting 6.6 million cases and 6,200 deaths. We report the long-term entomological and epidemiological effectiveness of city-wide deployment of wMel-strain Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti in Niteroi, a city of half a million people in Rio de Janeiro state, where Wolbachia releases across 70% of the urban population in 2017-2019 were expanded to remaining populated areas in 2023. wMel was durably established at [&ge;]95% prevalence in Ae. aegypti populations throughout Niteroi four years post-release, and up to seven years in the earliest release sites. This city-wide Wolbachia coverage provided sustained population-level protection against dengue throughout the five years post-intervention, including during the 2024 epidemic surge, averting an estimated three-quarters of the dengue case burden that would otherwise have been expected in Niteroi in 2024.

**Abstract:**
Background: Patients with rare cancers face substantial challenges due to limited evidence-based treatment options, resulting from sparse clinical trials. Advances in large language models (LLMs) and recommendation algorithms offer new opportunities to utilize all clinical trial information to improve clinical decisions. Methods: We used LLM to systematically extract and standardize more than 100,000 cancer trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Each trial was annotated using a customized scoring system reflecting cancer-treatment interactions based on clinical outcomes and trial attributes. Using this structured data set, we implemented three state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend potentially effective treatments across different cancer types. Results: The LLM-driven data extraction process successfully generated a comprehensive and rigorously curated database from fragmented clinical trial information, covering 78 cancer types and 5,315 distinct interventions. Recommendation models demonstrated high predictive accuracy (cross-validated RMSE: {0.49--0.62}) and identified clinically meaningful new treatments for melanoma, independently validated by oncology experts. Conclusions: Our study establishes a proof of concept demonstrating that the combination of LLMs with sophisticated recommendation algorithms can systematically identify novel and clinically plausible cancer treatments. This integrated approach may accelerate the identification of effective therapies for rare cancers, ultimately improving patient outcomes by generating evidence-based treatment recommendations where traditional data sources remain limited.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: Though dementia is a serious illness that progresses over many years, little is known about the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Objective: To test the impact of a virtual, nurse-led primary palliative care intervention on older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Methods: This randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed to compare the impact of {usual care} to {usual care plus a virtual, nurse-led, primary palliative care intervention} on community- dwelling, chronically ill older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Results: We hypothesize that patients in the virtual nurse intervention arm will have their primary palliative care needs identified and fulfilled compared to those in the usual care arm. Conclusions: Identification of the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of and/or with MCI, mild or moderate dementia will help refine intervention to effectively provide primary palliative care in a timely manner to these patients.

**Abstract:**
Introduction. HIV testing and treatment coverage among men in Zambia remains suboptimal, partly due to lower healthcare-seeking behavior compared to women. To address this gap, Circle of Hope (CoH), a local faith-based organization funded by the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), developed the community post (CP) model. CPs are staffed by multi-disciplinary teams that provide HIV-testing, anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) testing. This analysis assesses the impact of these CPs on HIV case finding, ART initiation, and VL suppression among men. Methods. Routine program data reported to PEPFAR by CoH Zambia were analyzed for two periods: pre-COVID 19 (April 2018-March 2020) and during the pandemic (April 2020-March 2022). Indicators included the number of HIV tests conducted and positive results received (overall and for index testing specifically), ART initiation among men living with HIV (MLHIV), 12-month retention on ART, and the proportion of clients with VL suppression (<1000 copies/mL). Results. Between April 2018 and March 2022, the number of CPs expanded from 9 to 38 across Zambia. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, men continued to represent a substantial share of clients: 49.5% to 41.4% of those tested, 38.5% to 42.0% of those diagnosed (p<0.001), and 38.9% to 43.3% of those initiated on ART (p<0.001). The number of men on ART rose from 3,320 (38%) to 13,580 (43%, p<0.000001). Retention and VL suppression among men also remained high, increasing slightly from 94% to 97% and 95% to 96%, respectively. Over 6,000 men were diagnosed through index testing services, with percent positivity consistently high, ranging from 54.4% to 61.1% (p<0.001). Conclusions. The CoH model was successful at identifying and linking MLHIV to HIV treatment services and assisting them to achieve and maintain viral suppression even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding this community-based model may help close HIV testing and treatment gaps among men and advance HIV epidemic control in Zambia and beyond.

**Abstract:**
Background There is a need for person-centred outcome measures (PCOMs) in tuberculosis (TB) clinical trials to capture the priorities of affected individuals relating to both disease and treatment, alongside the traditional efficacy and safety analysis. Methods We conducted a literature search to identify existing health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) measurement tools and instances where they have been used to evaluate TB disease in interventional studies. DR-TB survivors were recruited for focus group discussions in South Africa, Mongolia and Georgia to determine the most important aspects of disease and treatment experience from their perspective. A second round of focus groups then worked to prioritise these items and group them within different domains. A panel of researchers and academic clinicians evaluated existing PCOMs identified in the literature search using a published framework. Finally, an assessment was carried out by a experienced TB Community Advisory Group members for appropriateness and acceptability, and clinical trial site investigators for feasibility of the PCOMs. Results The initial round of 9 focus groups involving 57 participants identified priority items grouped under the fields overall quality of life, disease symptoms, and treatment and side effects. In the second round of four focus groups involving 26 participants, the highest ranked items under overall quality of life were duration of treatment, experience of swallowing pills, and how long before being able to contribute to the household. The most important symptoms were coughing, weight loss and breathlessness. The highest ranked side effects were nausea/vomiting, skin colour changes, and nerve problems. FACIT-TB was the only measurement tool assessed that was rated good for appropriateness, and excellent, good or fair in all other fields by community representatives, researchers and clinical trial site staff.

**Abstract:**
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) 2024 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment guidelines expand eligibility for nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment in individuals with chronic HBV infection. For countries to implement these guidelines, there is a critical need to understand the population who are treatment eligible. While HBV drug resistance (HBVDR) is uncommon, monitoring for any potential resistance is a relevant public health consideration. Methods: We studied a population in rural Uganda to describe the proportion of individuals eligible for treatment based on the 2024 WHO treatment guidelines. We determined how this proportion varies according to the eligibility criteria used, comparing the performance of different assessment tools. We calculated Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet Ratio Index; APRI, Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase-to-Platelet Ratio; GPR and transient elastography; TE and performed HBV sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology to determine the prevalence of HBVDR in treatment naive and treatment experienced individuals. Results: In this cohort, 24/63 (38%) individuals with CHB were eligible for treatment. This fell to 14/63 (22%) in a hypothetical scenario where TE was not available for the assessment of liver fibrosis. We demonstrate a lack of concordance between non-invasive tests (NIT) of liver disease in treatment-naive HBV mono-infected individuals. An APRI cut-off of 0.5 had a sensitivity of 23.0% for predicting a TE score of >7 kPa (F2 fibrosis). Sensitivity for detecting F2 fibrosis was increased to 38.5% using an APRI cut off of 0.36, and to 46.2% using the GPR. We did not identify any HBVDR in the HBV mono-infected treatment-naive population (n=58). 24/210 individuals were living with HIV/HBV coinfection; HBV was sequenced in 5 of these of whom 2 had genomic evidence of nucleos(t)ide analogue resistance (rt180M/204V). Conclusions: While the WHO 2024 treatment criteria offer an opportunity to expand access to care, there is a need to determine how assessment tools differ in determination of eligibility in different settings. HBVDR remains uncommon but more research is needed to understand its prevalence and clinical impact in African populations.

**Abstract:**
While widely used to study vaccine effectiveness, test negative designs (TND) also provide a platform for identifying and quantifying immunological correlates of protection against disease. A key component of such studies is the protection function, the mathematical relationship between the value of an immunological assay and the relative risk of disease. This function is often estimated using logistic regression, comparing the odds of disease at a given assay value to the odds at assay value zero. Here, we show through mathematical analysis and simulation experiments that logistic regression, while common, fundamentally constrains the functional forms of protection that can be inferred from data in TNDs, potentially leading to overly simplistic estimates of the protection function. To address this limitation, we adapt and analyze a scaled logit model, originally developed for case-control data, as a flexible alternative that allows for greater flexibility in estimating protection functions from TND data. We demonstrate that this approach improves accuracy across a range of biologically plausible protection functions, highlight conditions under which it may fail, and provide practical guidance for researchers to adopt it as a new standard for TND studies evaluating correlates of protection.

**Abstract:**
The growing interconnection between human, animal, and environmental health has escalated the need for integrated approaches to public health. The One Health framework addresses this necessity by promoting local, national, and global interdisciplinary collaboration. Population growth, intensive animal farming, and manmade environmental changes contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases of probable animal origin, such as COVID-19. Establishing the Quadripartite collaboration with four multilateral United Nations agencies underscores the increasing recognition of these interdependencies. This scoping review protocol aims to evaluate how One Health studies integrate human, animal, and environmental health, analyzing methodologies, scope, and interdisciplinary collaboration, to identify key achievements, existing gaps, and future research priorities. The projected literature search will include PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Virtual Health Library, Health Systems Evidence, and Social Systems Evidence. Additionally, grey literature will be retrieved from Opengrey, Thesis Commons, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations, by structured electronic search, as well as the first 100 entries in Google Scholar, manually. This protocol proposes to include studies, policies, regulations, strategies, and interventions published from 2004 onwards aimed at the prevention and integrated management of food safety, zoonotic diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and the impacts of climate change on health. No language filters will be applied. Two independent reviewers will analyze titles, abstracts, and full texts to conduct a two-phase review, with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. Data will be retrieved using a standardized data extraction form, and results will be presented in graphic and tabular format, accompanied by a narrative summary, to highlight the achievements of integrated One Health implementation. The expected result is the development of a scoping review protocol to map One Health studies and practices, which effectively integrate the human, animal, and environmental health dimensions applicable globally in public health scenarios.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: University students frequently experience challenges that affect their sleep quality, including academic stress, lifestyle habits, and socio-demographic factors. Common sleep disturbances, such as delayed sleep onset and poor sleep efficiency, often result in daytime dysfunction and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm. Methods: This cross-sectional study appraised sleep quality among undergraduate students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 530 undergraduate students were purposively selected from three public universities. Participants were chosen through convenience sampling, with students who had contracted COVID-19 during the study excluded from the sample. Results: The mean age of the university students was 21.1 (2.0) years. Regarding PSQI components, the participants showed moderate sleep latency (55.7%) and habitual sleep efficiency (56.0%), with mild levels of sleep disturbances at night (68.1%), daytime dysfunction (51.1%), and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm (48.5%). The global PSQI scores were poor for 59.4% of participants, while 40.6% had good scores, with a mean of 6.5(2.9). Among the students, 44.9% reported fair subjective sleep quality, followed by good (24.7%), very good (18.1%), and poor (12.3%) sleep quality. Lifestyle factors such as class attendance, online media usage, BMI, physical exercise, tea/coffee consumption, and smoking were significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Sleep quality factors like daytime sleep duration, nighttime sleep latency, and sleeping pill usage were also significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Significant associations were found between sleep quality and factors such as age, household income, daily study hours, BMI, daytime sleep, and sleep latency (p<0.05). Conclusion: The study revealed that longer sleep latency, daytime sleep, and sleeping pill usage were related with poorer sleep quality. It also emphasized that sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm were significant predictors of sleep quality.

**Abstract:**
Social isolation is a growing public health concern, particularly among cancer survivors who face persistent challenges in maintaining social connections following treatment. While its impact on mental health is increasingly recognized, the underlying pathways and contextual differences across rural and urban settings remain underexplored. This study aimed to identify the psychosocial and personal factors that contribute to perceived social isolation among U.S. cancer survivors and to assess how isolation mediates the relationship between these factors and mental health. We also examined whether these associations differ between rural and urban populations. Data were drawn from the 2022 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 6), with a subsample of cancer survivors (n = 926). A conceptual framework was developed using constructs from the Biopsychosocial Model, the Stress Process Model, the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, and the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to evaluate the relationships among personal factors (age, BMI, time since diagnosis, inability of self-care), psychosocial perceptions (perceived care quality, cancer information comprehension, negative life perception), social isolation, and mental health (PHQ-4). Multigroup analysis compared rural and urban survivors. Social isolation was a strong predictor of mental health, with key antecedents including cancer information access, inability of self-care, time since diagnosis, negative life perception, and perception of care quality. Several pathways varied by geography; for instance, the effects of self-care difficulty and care perception on isolation and mental health were significant only in urban settings. This study highlights the central role of social isolation in shaping mental health outcomes among cancer survivors and underscores the importance of targeted, context-sensitive interventions to reduce isolation and promote psychosocial well-being, particularly in underserved rural communities.

**Abstract:**
Background: Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumors frequently diagnosed in pediatric and young adult patients. These tumors respond poorly to conventional immunotherapy, though the precise reason for this is not known. We sought to characterize the systemic immune response to sarcomas by measuring the levels of circulating cytokines in the plasma of sarcoma patients, testing the hypothesis that the natures of a patient's immune response to their tumor directly affects outcome. Methods: Plasma was collected from newly diagnosed, treatment-naive pediatric sarcoma patients participating in an ongoing clinical trial, MCC20320. A panel of 18 cytokines was selected and cytokine levels were measured using the Luminex platform. Cytokine levels were analyzed based on clinicopathological parameters such as gender, age, stage, and survival. Results: We found that the cytokine profile in patients newly diagnosed with sarcoma is distinct from healthy controls, but different sarcomas were not distinguishable. Patients with osteosarcoma who had elevated levels of multiple cytokines had inferior overall survival compared to those with fewer or no elevated levels. Similarly, elevated levels of individual cytokines and chemokines, including IL-24, CXCL5, and CXCL10, were associated with inferior event-free or overall survival in patients with osteosarcoma. Perhaps most significantly, elevated IL-1B; at diagnosis was associated with metastatic presentation and inferior event-free survival in patients with osteosarcoma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that pediatric sarcoma patients mount a systemic immune response that may affect event-free or overall survival. IL-1B; in particular may be a valuable target for immunotherapy for osteosarcoma patients.

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

## Crosstalk between Proline Hydroxylation and Histidine Methylation Regulates Actin-Dependent Cell Mobility Control

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

## NetSyn: genomic context exploration of protein families

**Abstract:**
Background: The growing availability of large genomic datasets presents an opportunity to discover new metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions useful for industrial or synthetic biological applications. Efforts to identify new enzyme functions in this huge number of sequences cannot be achieved without the help of bioinformatics tools and the development of new strategies. Standard methods for assigning a biological function to a gene are based on sequence similarity. However, another way is to mine databases to identify conserved gene clusters (i.e. syntenies). Indeed in prokaryotic genomes, genes involved in the same pathway are frequently encoded in a single locus with an operonic organisation. This Genomic Context (GC) conservation is considered as a reliable indicator of functional relationships, and thus is a promising approach to improve the gene function prediction. Methods. Here we present NetSyn (Network Synteny), a tool which aims to cluster protein sequences according to the similarity of their genomic context rather than their sequence similarity. Starting from a set of protein sequences of interest, NetSyn retrieves neighbouring genes from the corresponding genomes as well as their protein sequences. Homologous protein families are then computed to measure GC conservation between each pair of input sequences using a GC conservation score. A network is created where nodes represent the input proteins and edges the fact that two proteins share a common GC. The weight of the edges corresponds to the synteny conservation score. The network is then partitioned into clusters of proteins sharing a high degree of synteny conservation. Results. As a proof of concept, we used NetSyn on two different datasets. The first one is made of homologous sequences of an enzyme family (the BKACE family, previously named DUF849) to divide it into sub-families of specific activities. NetSyn was able to go a step further by providing additional subfamilies to those already published. The second dataset corresponds to a set of non-homologous proteins consisting of different Glycosyl Hydrolases (GH) with the aim of interconnecting them and finding conserved operon-like genomic structures. NetSyn was able to find a locus composed of 3 non homologous glycosyl hydrolases, involved in the degradation of xyloglucan, in 162 genomes. Discussion. NetSyn is able to cluster proteins according to their genomic context, making it possible to establish functional links between proteins without considering their sequence similarity alone. We showed that NetSyn is efficient in exploring large protein families to define iso-functional groups. It can also highlight functional interactions between proteins from different families and predicts new conserved genomic structures that have not yet been experimentally characterised. NetSyn can also be useful for pinpointing annotation errors that have been propagated across databases, and for suggesting annotations on proteins currently annotated as "unknown". NetSyn is freely available at https://github.com/labgem/netsyn.

## Tyrosinase-induced neuromelanin accumulation triggers rapid dysregulation and degeneration of the mouse locus coeruleus

**Abstract:**
The locus coeruleus (LC), the major source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is among the earliest site of pathology in both Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD), and it undergoes catastrophic degeneration later in both disorders. Dysregulation of the LC is thought to contribute to prodromal symptoms of AD and PD such as anxiety and sleep disturbances, while frank LC loss promotes cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms responsible for its selective vulnerability are unknown. It has been suggested that neuromelanin (NM) pigment contributes to LC susceptibility, but causal relationships have been difficult to test because rodents do not naturally produce NM. Here, we report that viral-mediated expression of human tyrosinase induced pigmentation in mouse LC neurons that recapitulated key features of natural primate NM. One week of NM accumulation resulted in LC neuron hyperactivity, reduced tissue NE levels, transcriptional changes, and anxiety-like behavior. By 6-10 weeks, NM accumulation was associated with severe LC neuron neurodegeneration and microglial engulfment of the pigment granules, while the anxiety-like behavior abated. These phenotypes are reminiscent of LC dysfunction and cell death in AD and PD, validating this model for studying the consequences of NM accumulation in the LC as it relates to neurodegenerative disease.

Significance StatementAlzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) are two of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Because therapies that cure or even prevent their progression are lacking, research is focused on the identifying earliest signs of disease as targets for diagnosis and treatment. The locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of the neurotransmitter n norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is one of the first brain regions affected in both AD and PD. LC dysregulation promotes prodromal AD and PD symptoms, while its degeneration accelerates disease progression. Here we identify neuromelanin (NM) pigment as a LC vulnerability factor that induces neuronal hyperactivity followed by cell death. Approaches that mitigate NM accumulation and toxicity may target the earliest phases of neurodegenerative disease.

**Abstract:**
Brain pericytes maintain the blood-brain barrier (BBB), secrete neurotrophic factors and clear toxic proteins. Their loss in neurological disorders leads to BBB breakdown, neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Therefore, cell therapy to replace lost pericytes holds potential to restore impaired cerebrovascular and brain functions. However, the molecular composition and function of human iPSC-derived brain pericytes (iPSC-PC) remains poorly characterized. Here, we show by a quantitative analysis of 8,344 proteins and 20,572 phosphopeptides that iPSC-PC share 96% of total proteins and 98% of protein phosphorylation sites with primary human brain pericytes. This includes cell adhesion and tight junction proteins, transcription factors, and different protein kinase families of the human kinome. In pericyte-deficient mice, iPSC-PC home to host brain capillaries to form hybrid human-mouse microvessels with ligand-receptor associations. They repair BBB leaks and protect against neuron loss, which we show requires PDGRFB and pleiotrophin. They also clear Alzheimer's amyloid-beta; and tau neurotoxins via lipoprotein receptor. Thus, iPSC-PC may have potential as a replacement therapy for pericyte-deficient neurological disorders.

**Abstract:**
Disease phenotypes can be described as the consequence of interactions among molecular processes that are altered beyond resilience. Here, we address the challenge of assessing the possible alteration of intra- and inter-cellular molecular interactions among gene sets, which are intended to represent processes and or cellular phenotypes. We present an approach, designated as "Ulisse", which complements the existing methods of enrichment analysis and cell-cell communication analysis. It can be applied to a gene list as well as multiple ranked gene lists, typically derived in the context of omics or multi-omics studies. The approach highlights the presence of alterations in those components that control the interactions between processes or cells. Crosstalk quantification is supported by two null models. Further, the approach provides an additional way of identifying the genes associated with the phenotype. As a proof-of-concept, we applied Ulisse to study the alteration of pathway crosstalks and cell-cell communications in triple negative breast cancer samples, based on single-cell RNA sequencing. In conclusion, our work supports the usefulness of crosstalk analysis as an additional instrument in the "toolkit" of biomedical research for translating complex biological data into actionable insights.

## Resting-state alpha and mu rhythms change shape across development but lack diagnostic sensitivity for ADHD and autism

**Abstract:**
In the human brain, the alpha rhythm in occipital cortex and the mu rhythm in sensorimotor cortex are among the most prominent rhythms, with both rhythms functionally implicated in gating modality-specific information. Separation of these rhythms is non-trivial due to the spatial mixing of these oscillations in sensor space. Using a computationally efficient processing pipeline requiring no manual data cleaning, we isolated alpha and/or mu rhythms from electroencephalography recordings performed on 1605 children aged 5-18. Using the extracted time series for each rhythm, we characterized the waveform shape on a cycle-by-cycle basis and examined whether and how the waveform shape differs across development. We demonstrate that alpha and mu rhythms both exhibit nonsinusoidal waveform shape that changes significantly across development, in addition to the known large changes in oscillatory frequency. This dataset also provided an opportunity to assess oscillatory measures for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found no differences in the resting-state features of these alpha-band rhythms for either ADHD or ASD in comparison to typically developing participants in this dataset. While waveform shape is ignored by traditional Fourier spectral analyses, these nonsinusoidal properties may be informative for building more constrained generative models for different types of alpha-band rhythms, yielding more specific insight into their generation.

**Abstract:**
Perceptual decision-making is the process by which an animal uses sensory stimuli to choose an action or mental proposition. This process is thought to be mediated by neurons organized as attractor networks1,2. However, whether attractor dynamics underlie decision behavior and the complex neuronal responses remains unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings from hundreds of neurons, together with an unsupervised, deep learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in frontal cortex and striatum of rats while the subjects accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes, the first dominated by sensory inputs, and the second dominated by the autonomous dynamics, with flow in a direction (i.e., "neural mode") largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that the transition to the second regime corresponds to the moment of decision commitment. We developed a simplified model that approximates the coupled transition in dynamics and neural mode and allows precise inference, from each trials large-scale neural population activity, of a putative neurally-inferred time of commitment ("nTc") on that trial. The simplified model captures diverse and complex single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping3-5, as well as trial-averaged curved trajectories6-8, and reveals distinctions between brain regions. The estimated nTc times were not time-locked to stimulus onset or offset, or to response onset, but were instead broadly distributed across trials. If nTc marks the moment of decision commitment, sensory evidence before nTc should affect the decision, while evidence afterward should not. Behavioral analysis of trials aligned to their estimated nTc times confirmed this prediction. Our results show that the formation of a perceptual choice involves a rapid, coordinated transition in both the dynamical regime and the neural mode of the decision process that corresponds to commitment to a decision, and suggest this moment as a useful entry point for dissecting mechanisms underlying rapid changes in internal state.

**Abstract:**
Microbes exhibit precise control over their composition and geometry in order to adapt and grow in diverse environments. However, the mechanisms that orchestrate this simultaneous regulation, and how they are causally linked, remains poorly understood. In this work, we derive and experimentally test a biophysical model of cell size regulation in Escherichia coli which relates the cellular surface-to-volume ratio to the total macromolecular composition and partitioning of the proteome between cellular compartments. Central to this model is the observation that the macromolecular density of the cytoplasm and the protein density within the cell membranes are maintained at a constant ratio across growth conditions. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, single-cell microscopy, and biochemical assays, we show this model quantitatively predicts a non-linear relationship between the surface-to-volume ratio, proteome localization, and the total ribosome content of the cell. This model holds under perturbations of intracellular ppGpp concentrations-thereby changing the ribosomal content-demonstrating that cellular geometry is not strictly determined by the cellular growth rate. These findings provide a biophysical link between the coregulation of proteome organization and cellular geometry, offering a quantitative framework for understanding bacterial size regulation across conditions.

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a mathematical model for the growth of transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) inclusion bodies in neuron soma. The parameter representing accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers is also introduced. The models equations allow for the numerical calculation of the concentrations of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, as well as free TDP-43 oligomers and those deposited into inclusion bodies. By simulating the deposition of free oligomers into inclusion bodies, the model predicts the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies. An approximate solution to the model equations is derived for the scenario where protein degradation machinery is dysfunctional, leading to infinite half-lives for TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and both free and deposited oligomers. This solution, valid for large times, predicts that the inclusion body radius increases proportionately to the cube root of time, while accumulated neurotoxicity increases linearly with time. To the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to model the relationship between the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies and time, as well as the first to introduce the concept of accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers. The sensitivity analysis of the approximate solution indicates that the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity are independent of the kinetic constants at large timescales. While the numerical solution of the full mathematical model continues to work with finite half-lives, the approximate solution becomes invalid for scenarios with physiologically relevant (finite) half-lives of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and free misfolded oligomers. In contrast to the scenario with infinite half-lives, the numerical solution reveals that for different values of the kinetic constants, the curves representing the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity converge to distinct curves as time progresses.

**Abstract:**
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is typically treated empirically with vancomycin, with therapy later tailored based on susceptibility results. However, these tests occur before vancomycin exposure and do not account for adaptation during empiric treatment that can alter S. aureus susceptibility to first-line drugs. To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU, impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes. Our findings suggest a probabilistic approach to antimicrobial therapy, advocating for rapid genomic diagnostics alongside susceptibility testing to better anticipate and respond to evolutionary changes.

SignificanceAntibiotic treatment can influence bacterial evolution, altering the effectiveness of subsequent therapies by inducing collateral resistance or sensitivity. This study reveals that evolution toward vancomycin-intermediate resistance in the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus proceeds through at least two distinct evolutionary pathways: one characterized by alterations in cell wall metabolism and another by changes in global stress response. These adaptive trajectories result in contrasting collateral sensitivities to first-line antibiotics. By introducing the Collateral Response Score, we assess the uncertainty in these outcomes, providing a probabilistic framework to evaluate how past antibiotic exposure shapes future treatment responses. Further validation studies are needed; however, we believe that improved forecasting of pathogen evolution can enhance antibiotic stewardship, inform therapeutic decisions, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

**Abstract:**
Recent studies have established a reciprocal causal link between aging and the activation of transposable elements, characterized in particular by a de-repression of LINE-1 retrotransposons. These LINE-1 elements represent 21% of the human genome, but only a minority of these sequences retain the coding potential essential for their mobility. LINE-1 encoded proteins can induce cell toxicity implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, our knowledge of the expression and localization of LINE-1-encoded proteins in the central nervous system is limited. Using a novel approach combining atlas-based brain mapping with deep-learning algorithms on large-scale pyramidal brain images, we unveil a heterogeneous, neuron-predominant and widespread ORF1p expression throughout the murine brain at steady-state. In aged mice, ORF1p expression increases significantly which is corroborated in human post-mortem dopaminergic neurons by an increase in young LINE-1 elements including those with open reading frames. Mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous mouse ORF1p revealed novel, neuron-specific protein interactors. These findings contribute to a comprehensive description of the dynamics of LINE-1 and ORF1p expression in the brain at steady-state and in aging and provide insights on ORF1p protein interactions in the brain.

**Abstract:**
Proteobacterial methanotrophs are dependent on the oxidation of methane for ATP production and assimilation of carbon into biomass. Interestingly, some types of gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs thrive in oxygen-depleted zones of lakes and other aquatic ecosystems despite their reliance on oxygen to support methane oxidation. The model gammaproteobacterial methanotroph, Methylomonas denitrificans FJG1, oxidizes methane coupled to nitrate reduction under hypoxia and highly upregulates its expression of bacteriohemerythrin (Bhr). Bhr is a homolog of eukaryotic hemerythrin, which is a protein associated with oxygen binding. Ten bhr homologs were identified in the genome of M. denitrificans FJG1, requiring phylogenetic and gene expression analyses to pinpoint which homolog is likely responsible for delivering oxygen to support methane oxidation to under low oxygen conditions. This study examined the prevalence and phylogeny of the 10 bhr homologs from M. denitrificans FJG1 in the genomes of other methanotrophs and across the Bacteria. The homolog denoted "bhr-00" was specific to methanotroph genomes, was highly expressed in M. denitrificans FJG1 under hypoxia, and its predicted structure was nearly identical to a purified oxygen-scavenging hemerythrin protein from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath. Other bhr homologs upregulated from denitrifying cultures of M. denitrificans FJG1 included those with gene neighborhoods related to oxygen sensing, denitrification and chemotaxis. Together, this study uncovered potential multifunctional roles of bacteriohemerythrin genes of M. denitrificans FJG1 under low oxygen conditions and identified the bhr homolog that most likely enables and supports oxygen delivery to methane monooxygenase enzymes in anoxic ecosystems.

**Abstract:**
Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker[-&gt;]Brainstem[-&gt;]Thalamus[-&gt;]Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking activity upon multi-whisker stimulation, resembling the stable response pattern observed in barrels. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions.

**Abstract:**
The Global Pandemic Lineage (GPL) of the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been described as a main driver of amphibian extinctions on nearly every continent. Near complete genome of three Bd-GPL strains have enabled studies of the pathogen but the genomic features that set Bd-GPL apart from other Bd lineages is not well understood due to a lack of high-quality genome assemblies and annotations from other lineages. We used long-read DNA sequencing to assemble high-quality genomes of three Bd-BRAZIL isolates and one non-pathogen outgroup species Polyrhizophydium stewartii (Ps) strain JEL0888, and compared these to genomes of previously sequenced Bd-GPL strains. The Bd-BRAZIL assemblies range in size between 22.0 and 26.1 Mb and encode 8495-8620 protein-coding genes for each strain. Our pan-genome analysis provided insight into shared and lineage-specific gene content. The core genome of Bd consists of 6278 conserved gene families, with 202 Bd-BRAZIL and 172 Bd-GPL specific gene families. We discovered gene copy number variation in pathogenicity gene families between Bd-BRAZIL and Bd-GPL strains though none were consistently expanded in Bd-GPL or Bd-BRAZIL strains. Comparison within the Batrachochytrium genus and two closely related non-pathogenic saprophytic chytrids identified variation in sequence and protein domain counts. We further test these new Bd-BRAZIL genomes to assess their utility as reference genomes for transcriptome alignment and analysis. Our analysis examines the genomic variation between strains in Bd-BRAZIL and Bd-GPL and offers insights into the application of these genomes as reference genomes for future studies.

**Abstract:**
Deep learning-based compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction models are promising in the field of molecular biology, particularly for facilitating the drug discovery process. In practical applications, CPI models should achieve a high generalization performance, quantify prediction confidence, and ensure explainability. Here, we propose ChemGLaM, a chemical genomics language model for reliable and explainable CPI predictions, by addressing these three crucial aspects. ChemGLaM integrates independently pre-trained chemical and protein language models through an interaction block with a cross-attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in predicting novel CPIs. Incorporating uncertainty estimation and attention visualization enables ChemGLaM to enhance the success rate of virtual screening and to provide molecular insights into CPIs. Furthermore, we demonstrate its practical applicability by constructing a public database for large-scale CPI predictions and enabling drug/target exploration for candidate treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ChemGLaM represents a significant step toward overcoming the challenges of AI-driven drug discovery and addressing unmet medical needs.

**Abstract:**
In rodents, estrogens aromatized from androgens in the brain are essential for the development of male-typical behaviors. In many other vertebrates including humans and teleost fish, however, androgens facilitate these behaviors directly via the androgen receptor without aromatization into estrogens. Here we report that mutagenesis-derived male medaka fish lacking Cyp19a1b (a subtype of aromatase predominantly expressed in the brain) exhibit severely impaired male-typical mating and aggression, despite elevated brain androgen levels. These phenotypes can be rescued by estrogen administration, indicating that brain-derived estrogens are pivotal for male-typical behaviors even in teleosts. Our results further suggest that these estrogens facilitate male-typical behaviors by potentiating androgen action in the brain via the direct stimulation of androgen receptor transcription, thereby revealing a previously unappreciated mode of action of brain-derived estrogens. We additionally show that female fish lacking Cyp19a1b are less receptive to male courtship and conversely court other females, highlighting the significance of brain-derived estrogens in establishing sex-typical behaviors in both sexes.

## Striated fibre assemblins localise in the feeding groove of the 'typical excavate' Paratrimastix pyriformis

**Abstract:**
The spatial arrangement of microtubules in the cytoskeleton in the cells of protists has been used for decades for taxonomy and phylogenetic inference at various levels. In contrast, the protein composition of non-microtubular structures is mostly unknown. Exceptions are system I fibers in algae, which are built of striated fiber assemblins (SFAs). Interestingly, SFAs are also components of a range of other, dissimilar structures, playing a role in the cortex of ciliates, cell division in apicomplexans, and adhesion of the parasite Giardia to the intestine. In a broad bioinformatic survey, we show the existence of three ancestral eukaryotic paralogues of SFA, and note that they are present in all "typical excavates:" small heterotrophic flagellates bearing a ventral feeding groove. In one representative, Paratrimastix pyriformis, we detected two SFA paralogs using specific antibodies and expansion microscopy. We show that they co-localize selectively with several microtubules and structures attached to the basal body of the posterior flagellum, namely the right microtubular root, B-fiber, C-fiber, and composite fiber. We demonstrate that one of the paralogs self-assembles in vitro into striated filaments which, under negative staining and cryo-electron microscopy, resemble system I fibers as seen in previous studies. Given the facts that all three SFA paralogs appear to be ancestral to most eukaryotic lineages, as is probably the morphology of "typical excavates" with a ventral groove, we speculate that a role in the development or function of the feeding apparatus of the common ancestor of most if not all eukaryotes was the primary function of these proteins.

**Abstract:**
Understanding how the eyes, head, and hands coordinate in natural contexts is a critical challenge in visuomotor coordination research, often constrained by sedentary tasks, cued actions, or restricted settings. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment where participants could self-generate pick-and-place actions on a life-size shelf in a virtual environment, recording concurrent gaze and body movements. Subjects exhibited intricate translation and rotation movements of the eyes, head, and hands during the task. We employed a time-dependent principal component analysis to study the relationship between the movements of the eyes, head, and hands relative to the onset of the action. We reduced the overall dimensionality into 2D representations, capturing up to 65% of the movement variance just in time with the actions. Our analysis revealed a synergistic coupling of the eye-head and eye-hand systems, as well as a strong coupling within the head-hand system. The eyes synchronized with the head and hands close to the action onset, with variations in coupling observed in horizontal and vertical planes, indicating distinct mechanisms for coordination in the brain. Crucially, the head and hands remained tightly coupled throughout the observation period, suggesting a shared neural code driving these effectors. Notably, the low-dimensional representations of the eye-head-hand movement vectors showed maximum predictive accuracy of the actions location ~200ms before the action onset, highlighting just-in-time coordination among the three effectors. Furthermore, the predictive accuracy was significantly influenced by the location of the upcoming action. Our study emphasizes the differential visuomotor control subject to the task structure, providing insights into the dynamic interplay of eye, head, and hand movements during natural behavior.

NEW & NOTEWORTHYStudying natural, self-initiated, complex visuomotor coordination, we observe low-dimensional dynamics with distinct patterns along horizontal and vertical axes. The eyes horizontal movement showed notable independence, aligning with head and hand movements just in time for action. Notably, around critical events, the dimensionality of the complex movements is further reduced, indicating dynamic correspondence of eye-head-hand coordination.

**Abstract:**
Stimulation of specific cell groups under different network regimes (e.g., spontaneous activity or sensory-evoked activity) can provide insights into the neural dynamics of cortical columns. While these protocols are challenging to perform experimentally, modelling can serve as a powerful tool for such explorations. Using detailed electrophysiological and anatomical data from mouse V1, we built a novel spiking network model of a cortical column, which incorporates pyramidal cells and three distinct interneuron types (PV, SST, and VIP cells, specified per lamina), as well as the dynamic and voltage-dependent properties of AMPA, GABA, and NMDA receptors. We first demonstrate that thalamocortical feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) stimuli arriving in the column have opposite effects, leading to net columnar excitation and inhibition respectively and revealing translaminar gain control via full-column inhibition by layer 6. We then perturb one cell group (i.e. a cell type in a specific layer) at a time and observe the effects on other cell groups under distinct network states: spontaneous, feedforward-driven, feedback-driven, and a combination of feedforward and feedback. Our findings reveal that when a given group is perturbed, the columnar response varies significantly based on its state, with strong sensory feedforward input decreasing columnar sensitivity to all perturbations and feedback input serving as modulator of intra columnar interactions. Given that activity changes within specific neuronal populations are difficult to predict a priori in experiments, our model may constitute a useful tool to predict outcomes of perturbations and assist in experimental design.

Author SummaryIn this study, we explored how stimulating specific groups of neurons under different conditions (spontaneous or stimulus-evoked states) can help us understand the dynamics of visual cortical columns in mouse cortex. We developed a data-constrained model of a cortical column that includes several cell types (excitatory neurons as well as multiple inhibitory neuron types) and synaptic receptors. Our findings reveal that signals coming from higher brain areas (feedback input) and sensory input (feedforward input) have different impacts on the column: sensory inputs generally increase activity within the column, while feedback tends to decrease it. We then considered input targeting one cell type at a time to see how it affects the internal dynamics. Our results show that neural responses to selected input vary depending on whether the cortical column is in a resting state or being stimulated by feedforward input or feedback input. This model is a useful tool for predicting the outcomes of these cell interactions, which can help in planning real-world experiments and understanding how our brain processes information.

## Synaptic proteome diversity is shaped by the levels of glutamate receptors and their regulatory proteins

**Abstract:**
Synapses formed by equivalent pairs of pre- and postsynaptic neurons have similar electrophysiological characteristics, belonging to the same type. However, these are generally confined to microscopic brain regions, precluding their proteomic analysis. This fact has greatly limited our ability to investigate the molecular basis of synaptic physiology. We introduce a procedure to characterise the synaptic proteome of microscopic brain regions and explore the molecular diversity among the synapses forming the trisynaptic circuit in the hippocampus. While we observe a remarkable proteomic diversity among these synapses, we also report that proteins involved in the regulation of the function of glutamate receptors are differentially expressed in all of them. Moreover, neuron-specific gene expression programs would contribute to their regulation. Here, we introduce a combined proteomics and transcriptomics analysis uncovering a previously unrecognised neuron-specific control of synaptic proteome diversity, directed towards the regulation of glutamate receptors and their regulatory proteins.

**Abstract:**
Single-cell multiomic techniques have sparked immense interest in developing a comprehensive multi-modal map of diverse neuronal cell types and their brain wide projections. However, investigating the spatial organization, transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of brain wide projection neurons is hampered by the lack of efficient and easily adoptable tools. Here we introduce Projection-TAGs, a retrograde AAV platform that allows multiplex tagging of projection neurons using RNA barcodes. By using Projection-TAGs, we performed multiplex projection tracing of the mouse cortex and high-throughput single-cell profiling of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of the cortical projection neurons. Projection-TAGs can be leveraged to obtain a snapshot of activity-dependent recruitment of distinct projection neurons and their molecular features in the context of a specific stimulus. Given its flexibility, usability, and compatibility, we envision that Projection-TAGs can be readily applied to build a comprehensive multi-modal map of brain neuronal cell types and their projections.

## Mimicking opioid analgesia in cortical pain circuits

**Abstract:**
The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural dynamics to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviors and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep-learning behavioral analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an unpleasant, affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective-motivational behaviors without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic mu-opioid receptor promoter to drive chemogenetic inhibition. This opioid-mimetic gene therapy recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain, thereby offering a new strategy for precision pain management targeting a key nociceptive cortical opioid circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

**Abstract:**
The events that lead to protein misfolding diseases are not fully understood. Many proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., TDP43) interact with nucleic acids, including RNA G-quadruplexes. In this work, we investigate whether RNA G-quadruplexes play a role in TDP43 condensation in biophysical and cellular models. We find that G-quadruplexes modulate TDP43 aggregation in vitro and condensation in multiple cell types, including yeast, HEK293T, and motor-neuron-like NSC-34 cells. In yeast cells, treatment with G-quadruplexes causes increased TDP43 accumulation in cells before cellular death. In HEK293T cells expressing TDP43, incubation with G-quadruplex-binding small molecules causes an increase in G4 stability that also stabilizes TDP43 and reduces TDP43 condensation induced by proteasomal or oxidative stress. Finally, in NSC-34 cells overexpressing exogenous TDP43, we show that G-quadruplexes co-localize with TDP43 condensates under stress conditions and treatment with G-quadruplex-binding small molecules decreases TDP43-mediated toxicity. Together, these findings suggest that a novel future approach to explore for treating protein misfolding diseases may be to target specific RNA structures such as G-quadruplexes.

**Abstract:**
Archaeal tubulin-like cytoskeletal protein CetZ1 is required for rod-cell morphogenesis during the development of motile cells in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. It has been unknown whether CetZ1 or its paralogs contribute to motility solely through the effects of rod cell shape on swimming speed, or in other ways too. Here, we found that CetZ1 also plays significant roles in the polar assembly of the motility machinery including the archaellum base protein ArlD1, the chemotaxis sensory array adapter CheW1, and signal transducer CheY. Notably, overexpression of cetZ1 or cetZ2 differentially influenced motility and the polar assembly of the motility machinery, but caused no detectable change in the rod shape of motile cells. CetZ1 localized at the poles of motile cells, but its imperfect co-localization with the motility machineries suggests it may promote their assembly indirectly, such as via a role in organisation or structure of the cell poles.

**Abstract:**
Ion channels are necessary for proper water and nutrient absorption in the intestine, thereby supporting cellular metabolism and organismal growth. While a role for Na+ co-transporters and pumps in intestinal nutrient absorption is well defined, how individual K+ uniporters function in this process is poorly understood. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that a gain-of-function mutation in twk-26, which encodes a two-pore domain K+ ion channel orthologous to human KCNK3, facilitates nutrient absorption and suppresses the metabolic and developmental defects caused by loss of DRL-1/FLR-4 signaling. Mutations in drl-1 and flr-4, which encode two unique kinases that are components of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the downstream flr-1 Na+ ion channel, cause severe growth defects, reduced lipid storage, and a dramatic increase in autophagic lysosomes, which mirror dietary restriction phenotypes. We reveal that this dietary restriction phenotype is likely the result of impaired intestinal amino acid absorption, which is restored upon activation of TWK-26. Furthermore, we show that loss of flr-4 disrupts intracellular and extracellular pH gradients, suggesting that the FLR-4 pathway may be necessary to maintain intestinal ion homeostasis and facilitate nutrient absorption. The altered pH gradients in the flr-4 mutant are partially restored by activation of TWK-26, demonstrating a novel role for this K+ ion channel in governing intestinal physiology and metabolism.

**Abstract:**
In the canonical interpretation of dopaminergic neuron activity during Pavlovian conditioning, initially cell firing is triggered by unexpected rewards. Upon learning, activation instead follows the reward-predictive conditioned stimulus, and when expected rewards are withheld, firing is inhibited. However, little is known about dopaminergic neuron activity during the actual learning process in complex operant tasks. Here, we recorded optogenetically identified dopaminergic neurons of ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice training in multiple, successive operant sensory discrimination tasks. A delay between nose-poke choices and trial outcome signals (for reward or punishment) probed for predictive activity. During training, but prior to criterion performance, firing rates signaled correct versus incorrect choices, but prior to outcome signals. Thus, the neurons predicted whether choices would be rewarded, despite the animals' subthreshold behavioral performance. Surprisingly, these neurons also fired after reward delivery, as if the rewards had been unexpected according to the canonical view, but activity was inhibited after punishment signals, as if the reward had been expected after all. These inconsistencies suggest revision of theoretical formulations of dopaminergic neuronal activity to embody multiple roles in temporal difference learning and actor-critic models. Furthermore, on training trials when these neurons predicted that a given choice was correct and would be rewarded, surprisingly, the mice adhered to other non-rewarded and untrained task strategies (e.g., spatial alternation). The DA neurons' reward prediction activity could serve as critic signals for the choices just made. This consistent with the notion that the brain must reconcile multiple Bayesian belief representations during learning.

**Abstract:**
Target of Rapamycin (TOR) complexes and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are crucial signaling hubs that coordinate adaptive responses to environmental inputs. While GPCR-mediated regulation of TOR has been extensively studied, little is known about TOR-mediated regulation of GPCRs. Here, we establish TOR as a regulator of GPCR signaling via its control of receptor endocytosis in the yeast mating system. By pairing fluorescence microscopy with yeast genetic approaches, we identify the machinery that bridges TOR nutrient sensing to GPCR internalization. Furthermore, we find that autophagic machinery is employed during mating to deliver active receptor to the vacuole (lysosome), suppressing the mating pathway. These results demonstrate that TOR regulates the localization and signaling of the yeast mating GPCR in both ligand-dependent and -independent contexts. These pathways are highly conserved, suggesting that TOR-regulation of GPCRs may be a broadly conserved mechanism for integrating competing signals involving metabolic state and external communications.

**Abstract:**
The language of biology, encoded in DNA, RNA, and proteins, forms the foundation of life but remains challenging to decode due to its complexity. Traditional computational methods often struggle to integrate information across these molecules, limiting a comprehensive understanding of biological systems. Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with pre-trained models offer new possibilities for interpreting biological language. Here, we introduce LucaOne, a pre-trained foundation model trained on nucleic acid and protein sequences from 169,861 species. Through large-scale data integration and semi-supervised learning, LucaOne demonstrates an understanding of key biological principles, such as DNA-Protein translation. Using few-shot learning, it effectively comprehends the central dogma of molecular biology and performs competitively on tasks involving DNA, RNA, or protein inputs. Our results highlight the potential of unified foundation models to address complex biological questions, providing an adaptable framework for bioinformatics research and enhancing the interpretation of life's complexity.

**Abstract:**
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer that is unresponsive to hormonal therapies. One potential TNBC-specific therapeutic target is NQO1, as it is highly expressed in many TNBC patients and lowly expressed in non-cancer tissues. Here we use a derivative of DNQ, isobutyl-deoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ) that is more potent and specific in killing TNBC cells than NQO1-activator {beta}-lapachone while displaying strong NQO1-dependence. We evaluated the cellular signaling changes that occur following 4-hour treatment of TNBC cells with either single agent or combination IB-DNQ and / or PARP inhibitor (Rucaparib). Short treatments (4 hours) with IB-DNQ alone or combined with the PARP inhibitor Rucaparib revealed few changes in protein abundance but significant rapid alterations in protein phosphorylation and thermal stability, with clear synergy in the combination treatment. Key phosphorylated targets linked to RNA Polymerase II inhibition and DNA damage response were altered during our short time treatment. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) identified novel, combination-specific changes in protein biophysical state suggesting new therapeutic vulnerabilities in TNBC cells. Our findings highlight how even brief treatments can uncover distinct biophysical protein changes via TPP, offering a resource for mechanistic studies of IB-DNQ mechanism of action and the development of NQO1-activated therapeutics for TNBC treatment.

**Abstract:**
Accumulation of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the hippocampus triggers cognitive memory decline in Alzheimers disease (AD). The incidence and mortality of sporadic AD were tightly associated with diabetes and hyperlipidemia, while the exact linked molecular is uncertain. Here, we reported that serum Kallistatin concentrations were meaningfully higher in AD patients, with a higher concentration of fasting blood glucose and triglyceride. In addition, the constructed Kallistatin-transgenic (KAL-TG) mice defined its cognitive memory impairment phenotype and lower LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons accompanied by increased A{beta} deposition and tau phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Kallistatin could directly bind to the Notch1 receptor and thereby upregulate BACE1 expression by inhibiting PPAR{gamma} signaling, resulting in A{beta} cleavage and production. Besides, Kallistatin could promote the phosphorylation of tau by activating GSK-3{beta}. Fenofibrate, a hypolipidemic drug, could alleviate cognitive memory impairment by down-regulating A{beta} and tau phosphorylation of KAL-TG mice. Collectively, our data clarified a novel mechanism for A{beta} accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation regulation by Kallistatin, which might play a crucial role in linking metabolic syndromes and cognitive memory deterioration, and suggested that fenofibrate might have the potential for treating metabolism-related AD. Key words: Alzheimers disease, Kallistatin, A{beta}42, BACE1, Diabetes

**Abstract:**
Spatial biology experiments integrate the molecular and histological landscape of tissues to provide a previously inaccessible view of tissue biology, unlocking the architecture of complex multicellular tissues. Within spatial biology, spatial transcriptomics platforms are among the most advanced, allowing researchers to characterize the expression of thousands of genes across space. These new technologies are transforming our understanding of how cells are organized in space and communicate with each other to determine emergent phenotypes. This is particularly important in cancer research, as tumor evolution is shaped not only by the genetic properties of cancer cells but also by how they interact with the tumor microenvironment and their spatial organization. While many platforms can generate spatial transcriptomics profiles, it is still unclear in which context each platform better suits the needs of its users. Here we compare the results obtained using 5 different spatial transcriptomics (VISIUM, VISIUM CytAssist, VisiumHD, Xenium, and CosMx) and one spatial proteomics (VISIUM CytAssist) platforms across serial sections of 6 FFPE samples from primary human tumors covering some of the most common forms of the disease (lung, breast, colorectal, bladder, lymphoma and ovary). We observed that the VISIUM platform with CytAssist chemistry yielded superior data quality than manual VISIUM. On the other hand, Xenium consistently produced more reliable results for in situ platforms, with better gene clustering and fewer false positives than CosMx. Importantly, these platform-based variations didn't significantly affect cell type identification. VisiumHD offers the best options of both worlds, with subcellular resolution and whole-transcriptome coverage, albeit with some limitations that need to be accounted for in downstream analyses. Finally, by comparing VISIUM protein profiles with the spatial transcriptomics data from all four platforms on each sample, we identified several genes with mismatched RNA and protein expression patterns, highlighting the importance of multi-omics profiling to reveal the true biology of human tumors.

## Surface Wetting Is a Key Determinant of α-Synuclein Condensate Maturation

**Abstract:**
-Synuclein self-assembles into amyloid fibrils during neurodegeneration. The protein can also self-assemble via liquid-liquid phase separation to form biomolecular condensates. The link between these processes is evident, as -synuclein condensates can mature into amyloids. However, the mechanisms driving this maturation remain largely unknown, particularly when incorporating pathological post-translational modifications known to affect -synuclein self-assembly in the absence of LLPS, such as N-terminal truncation. Moreover, condensates are primarily studied as isolated entities; however, it is increasingly evident that they interact with various cellular components and surfaces. Here, we developed a microscopy-based quantitative real-time imaging protocol to investigate how N-terminal truncation influences -synuclein condensate formation, well surface wetting, and maturation. We found that increasing -synuclein truncation, which reduces N-terminal hydrophobicity, inhibits condensate sedimentation, enhances surface wettability, and accelerates maturation. Additionally, by increasing well surface hydrophobicity we decreased -synuclein condensate wettability, delaying their maturation. Thus, we propose that enhanced wettability, which increases the condensate surface-to-volume ratio, promotes -synuclein nucleation at the condensate-bulk solution interface, thereby accelerating maturation. Our results reveal distinct mechanistic roles for -synuclein N-terminal residues and indicate that condensate wetting on cellular surfaces, such as synaptic vesicles, may drive toxic aggregate formation during neurodegeneration.

**Abstract:**
Spatial transcriptomics technologies aim to localize gene expression in tissues and typically use capture surfaces that have undergone spatial indexing or optical decoding to relate surface sequences to spatial positions. Slide-tags is a recently developed method by Russell et al. that inverts this principle, instead diffusing probes from a pre-decoded bead array into tissues, tagging nuclei with spatial bead barcodes. We reanalyzed this data and discovered a latent, spatially informative cell-bead network formed incidentally as a result of barcode diffusion and the biophysical properties of the tissue. By optimizing proximity constraints encoded in the cell-bead network structure, we could infer cell locations without any spatial indexing, placing Slide-tags among a new generation of optics-free, network-based imaging-by-sequencing approaches, a fundamental departure from classical spatial sequencing technologies based on pre-indexed arrays.

**Abstract:**
Animals must balance the urgent need to find food during starvation with the critical necessity to avoid toxic substances to ensure their survival. In Drosophila, specialized Gustatory Receptors (GRs) expressed in Gustatory Receptor Neurons (GRNs) are critical for distinguishing between nutritious and potentially toxic food. GRNs project their axons from taste organs to the Subesophageal Zone (SEZ) in the Central Brain (CB) of Drosophila, where gustatory information is processed. Although the roles of GRs and GRNs are well-documented, the processing of gustatory information in the SEZ remains unclear. To better understand gustatory sensory processing and feeding decision-making, we molecularly characterized the first layer of gustatory interneurons, referred to as Gustatory Second-Order Neurons (G2Ns), which receive direct input from GRNs. Using trans-synaptic tracing with trans-Tango, cell sorting, and bulk RNAseq under fed and starved conditions, we discovered that G2Ns vary based on gustatory input and that their molecular profile changes with the fly's metabolic state. Further data analysis has revealed that a pair of neurons in the SEZ, expressing the neuropeptide Leucokinin (SELK neurons), receive simultaneous input from GRNs sensing bitter (potentially toxic) and sweet (nutritious) information. Additionally, these neurons also receive inputs regarding the starvation levels of the fly. These results highlight a novel mechanism of feeding regulation and metabolic integration.

## Longitudinal trajectories of brain development from infancy to school age and their relationship to literacy development

**Abstract:**
Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures support long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and childrens home literacy environments, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to first-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop by birth but undergo further refinement between infancy and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.

Significance StatementReading is crucial for academic, vocational, and health outcomes, but acquiring proficient reading skills is a protracted developmental process involving lower-level subskills and brain structures that undergo rapid development starting in infancy. We examined how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development support long-term acquisition of reading using a reproducible pipeline we developed specifically for infant-to-school-age longitudinal MRI data. Findings suggest that the brain bases of reading-related skills begin to develop by birth but continue building between infancy and preschool. This study emphasizes the importance of considering academic skill acquisition as a dynamic process preceding the emergence of the skill, and it offers a roadmap for future studies to examine relationships between early brain development and academic skill acquisition.

## Cell division protein A (CdpA) organises and anchors the division ring at midcell in haloarchaea

**Abstract:**
Many archaea appear to divide through the coordinated activities of two FtsZ homologues (FtsZ1 and FtsZ2) and another bacterial cell division homologue (SepF), which are part of the midcell division ring. Here, we identify an additional protein (HVO_0739, renamed CdpA) that is involved in cell division in Haloferax volcanii, with homologues in other Haloarchaea. CdpA localizes at the mid-cell division ring, and this requires the presence of the ring-assembly protein FtsZ1. The division constriction protein FtsZ2 also influenced the proper midcell assembly and structure of CdpA. In the absence of CdpA, cells frequently failed to divide properly, and FtsZ1 formed poorly condensed pseudo-helical structures spanning across a broad region of the cell, whereas FtsZ2 showed mispositioned foci, nano-rings, and filaments. The rate of directional movement of FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 structures around the division ring appeared minimally affected by loss of CdpA, which resulted in continual repositioning of the aberrant FtsZ structures in the cells. In contrast to the FtsZ proteins, CdpA formed relatively immobile foci around the ring. Protein domain function studies, pull-down assays, and multimer structure predictions suggest that CdpA is part of a membrane complex that tethers FtsZ2 and other division proteins to the midcell membrane. Our discovery of an archaeal FtsZ organisation and midcell anchor protein offers new insights into cell division mechanisms that are similar across the tree of life.

**Abstract:**
The organization of cell-cell contacts is fundamental for multi-cellular life and operation of organs. Synapses, prototypic contact sites for neuronal communication, are key to brain function and work over the last decades identified multiple synaptic cell adhesion molecules (sCAMs) that drive their organization. Whether these sCAMs operate independently or in coordination through yet unknown linker proteins remained elusive. Here, we used a systematic large-scale multi-epitope affinity-purification approach combined with quantitative mass spectrometry and immuno-EM to comprehensively map trans-synaptic protein networks in the mouse brain. We discover a presynaptic core-module assembled from the two major sCAM families, Neurexins1-3 and LAR-type receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRD,S,F), and the previously uncharacterized tetraspanin proteins T178A, B. These ternary Neurexin-T178-PTPR complexes form through their transmembrane domains and assemble during biogenesis in the ER. Loss of T178B results in module dissociation, strong reduction of LAR-PTPRs and redistribution of synaptic Neurexins. At synapses, the Neurexin-T178-PTPR module recruits stable and extended trans-synaptic protein networks with defined pre- and post-synaptic partners and secreted extracellular linkers. The network architecture robustly interlinks the distinct functional modules/machineries of the presynaptic active zone and establishes tight associations with XKR-type lipid scramblases and postsynaptic GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors. Our data identify a universal presynaptic core-module for synaptic adhesion and trans-synaptic signaling in the mammalian brain.

**Abstract:**
Cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography provide crucial experimental data for obtaining atomic-detail models of biomacromolecules. Refining these models relies on library-based stereochemical restraints, which, in addition to being limited to known chemical entities, do not include meaningful noncovalent interactions relying solely on nonbonded repulsions. Quantum mechanical (QM) calculations could alleviate these issues but are too expensive for large molecules. We present a novel AI-enabled Quantum Refinement (AQuaRef) based on AIMNet2 neural network potential mimicking QM at substantially lower computational costs. By refining 41 cryo-EM and 30 X-ray structures, we show that this approach yields atomic models with superior geometric quality compared to standard techniques, while maintaining an equal or better fit to experimental data. Notably, AQuaRef aids in determining proton positions, as illustrated in the challenging case of short hydrogen bonds in the parkinsonism-associated human protein DJ-1 and its bacterial homolog YajL.

## The Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR52 is a Novel Regulator of Breast Cancer Multicellular Organization

**Abstract:**
Background: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane-bound receptors that transmit critical signals from extracellular to intracellular spaces. Transcriptomic data of resected breast tumors show that low mRNA expression of orphan GPCR GPR52 correlates with reduced overall survival in patients with breast cancer, leading to the hypothesis that loss of GPR52 supports breast cancer progression. Methods: CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knockout GPR52 in the human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, and in the non-cancerous breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. 2D and 3D in vitro studies, electron microscopy, Matrigel culture, and a zebrafish xenograft model were used to assess the morphology and behavior of GPR52 KO cells. RNA-sequencing and proteomic analyses were also conducted on these cell lines, and transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to compare GPR52-null and wild-type (WT) signatures in breast cancer. Results: Loss of GPR52 was found to be associated with increased cell-cell interaction in 2D cultures, altered 3D spheroid morphology, and increased propensity to organize and invade collectively in Matrigel. Furthermore, GPR52 loss was associated with features of EMT in MDA-MB-468 cells, and zebrafish injected with GPR52 KO cells developed a greater total cancer area than those injected with control cells. RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses of GPR52-null breast cancer cells revealed an increased cAMP signaling signature. Consistently, we found that treatment of wild-type (WT) cells with forskolin, which stimulates the production of cAMP, induces phenotypic changes associated with GPR52 loss, and inhibition of cAMP production rescued some GPR52 KO phenotypes. Conclusion: GPR52 is an orphan GPCR and its role in cancer progression has not been previously characterized. We found that GPR52 loss in breast cancer cells can lead to increased cell clustering, collective invasion, and EMT in vitro. These are features of increased cancer aggression. Our results reveal that GPR52 loss is a potential mechanism by which breast cancer progression may occur and support the investigation of GPR52 agonism as a therapeutic option for breast cancer.

**Abstract:**
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) occur primarily in the small intestine, lung and pancreas. Due to their rarity compared to other malignancies in these organs, their complex biology remains poorly understood, including their oncogenesis, tumor composition and the intriguing phenomena of mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN). Here we profiled ten low-grade small intestine NET (SiNET) tumor samples as well as one mixed lung tumor by single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq. We find that SiNETs are largely separated into two distinct subtypes, in which the neuroendocrine cells upregulate epithelial or neuronal markers, respectively. Surprisingly, in both subtypes the neuroendocrine cells are largely non-proliferative while higher proliferation is observed in multiple non-malignant cell types. Specifically, B and plasma cells are highly proliferative in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype, potentially reflecting the outcome of high Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) expression in those tumors, which may constitute a relevant target. Finally, our analysis of a mixed lung neuroendocrine tumor identifies a population of putative progenitor cells that may give rise to both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (squamous) cells, potentially explaining the origin of the mixed histology. Taken together, our results provide important insights and hypotheses regarding the biology of neuroendocrine neoplasms.

**Abstract:**
Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced our understanding of meaning representation in the human brain. However, increasingly large LLMs have been questioned as valid cognitive models due to their extensive training data and their ability to access context hundreds of words long. In this study, we investigated whether instruction tuning, another core technique in recent LLMs beyond mere scaling, can enhance models' ability to capture linguistic information in the human brain. We evaluated the self-attention of base and fine-tuned LLMs of different sizes against human eye movement and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity patterns during naturalistic reading. We show that scaling has a greater impact than instruction tuning on model-brain alignment, reinforcing the scaling law in brain encoding performance. These finding have significant implications for understanding the cognitive plausibility of LLMs and their role in studying naturalistic language comprehension.

**Abstract:**
Intravital microscopy (IVM) enables live imaging of animals at single-cell level, offering essential insights into cancer progression. This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological and dynamic single cell features. BEHAV3D-TP integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers without advanced computational expertise to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
Infectious diseases, also known as communicable disease or transmissible disease is illness that is caused due to pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. One of such infection is caused by zoonotic virus (bat-borne) known as Nipah virus (NiV). NiV is one of the worlds deadliest viruses leading to highest mortality rates. It is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to category C priority pathogen that belongs to genus Hepanivirus, and family Paramyxoviridae. The first occurrence of NiV was observed in Malaysia-Singapore during 1998-1999 and the most recent outbreak in Kozhikode district of Kerala in 2018.

Currently, no drugs or vaccines specific to NiV have proven to yield effective outcome at advanced stage of the disease. However, some therapies involving antiviral drug like Ribavirin along with other medicines have shown to recover patients, reducing the death rate by 36%. Due to extensive research various therapeutic strategies have been proven to successfully target the viral infection during the early stages in animal models. Several vaccines have been under investigation and clinical trials serving as a promising approach towards effective and safe vaccine in both livestock animals and humans.

This study underscores the essential contributions shaping the academic discourse in nipah virus research, bringing to light the most influential studies within the co-citation and co-occurrence network analysis. By identifying the keywords, we gain valuable insights into the foundational research driving advancements in this research area. The detailed mapping of the co-citation network further illuminates the interconnectedness of various research themes and the collaborative efforts that boost the field of nipah virus research in different horizons. The recognition of influential studies not only highlights the depth and breadth of scholarly engagement but also provides a roadmap for future research endeavours.

**Abstract:**
The growing interconnection between human, animal, and environmental health has escalated the need for integrated approaches to public health. The One Health framework addresses this necessity by promoting local, national, and global interdisciplinary collaboration. Population growth, intensive animal farming, and manmade environmental changes contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases of probable animal origin, such as COVID-19. Establishing the Quadripartite collaboration with four multilateral United Nations agencies underscores the increasing recognition of these interdependencies. This scoping review protocol aims to evaluate how One Health studies integrate human, animal, and environmental health, analyzing methodologies, scope, and interdisciplinary collaboration, to identify key achievements, existing gaps, and future research priorities. The projected literature search will include PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Virtual Health Library, Health Systems Evidence, and Social Systems Evidence. Additionally, grey literature will be retrieved from Opengrey, Thesis Commons, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations, by structured electronic search, as well as the first 100 entries in Google Scholar, manually. This protocol proposes to include studies, policies, regulations, strategies, and interventions published from 2004 onwards aimed at the prevention and integrated management of food safety, zoonotic diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and the impacts of climate change on health. No language filters will be applied. Two independent reviewers will analyze titles, abstracts, and full texts to conduct a two-phase review, with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. Data will be retrieved using a standardized data extraction form, and results will be presented in graphic and tabular format, accompanied by a narrative summary, to highlight the achievements of integrated One Health implementation. The expected result is the development of a scoping review protocol to map One Health studies and practices, which effectively integrate the human, animal, and environmental health dimensions applicable globally in public health scenarios.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

**Abstract:**
Despite intensive study, gaps remain in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to limited contextual metadata accompanying most large genomic surveillance datasets. We analyzed over 130,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, over 85,000 with matched epidemiological data, collected in Massachusetts from November 2021 to January 2023, to investigate viral transmission dynamics at high resolution. The data were drawn from diagnostic testing at >600 facilities representing schools, workplaces, public testing, and other sectors, and encompass the emergence of six major viral lineages, each representing a new outbreak. We found urban areas as key hubs for new lineage introduction and interurban transmission as facilitating spread throughout the state. Young adults, especially those on college campuses, served as early indicators of emerging lineage dominance. Resident-aged populations in college campuses and nursing homes exhibited a higher likelihood of being linked to within-facility transmission, while staff-aged at those facilities were more linked to their surrounding community. Individuals with recent vaccine doses, including boosters, had a lower likelihood of initiating transmission. This dataset shows the value of linking genomic and epidemiologic data at scale for higher resolution insights into viral dynamics and their implication for public health strategy.

**Abstract:**
IntroductionPneumonia is a leading cause of under-five mortality, with 30 million annual cases in India. Despite national guidelines, significant barriers to timely and appropriate care-seeking persist. Caregivers often face financial constraints, lack of awareness, mistrust in government facilities, and a preference for non-registered medical practitioners (non-RMP), delaying effective treatment. This study explores care-seeking behaviors, associated sociodemographic factors, and barriers to access to appropriate healthcare for childhood pneumonia in rural India.

MethodsThis study is part of a broader implementation research (IR) initiative and represents its formative phase. This mixed-methods study was conducted in Palwal district, Haryana, covering 42 villages (population: 107,440). A cross-sectional survey identified suspected pneumonia cases among 9,593 under-five children through house-to-house visits using a structured checklist. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, health insurance, care-seeking patterns, and provider preferences were collected. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) identified potential confounders in the association between care-seeking behaviour and key exposure variables. Additionally, qualitative in-depth interviews explored caregivers perceptions, decision-making, and healthcare barriers to pneumonia management. Quantitative data were analysed using logistic regression, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed using the Three Delays Model. Suspected under-five pneumonia cases caregivers and families were actively engaged in this formative phase to inform Phase II implementation strategies of broader IR, ensuring community-driven and contextually relevant strategies.

ResultsAmong 231 suspected pneumonia cases, 97% of caregivers sought medical care, but 71% consulted non-RMPs, and only 3.6% visited government facilities. Seeking appropriate care was associated with higher maternal education (AOR 6.5, 95% CI: 2.7, 9.7) and higher wealth index (AOR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.6). Thematic analysis revealed delays due to symptom misinterpretation, reliance on home remedies, financial constraints, gender biases, mistrust in public healthcare services, and logistical barriers.

ConclusionDespite high care-seeking rates, provider preferences, socio-cultural factors, and systemic barriers delay appropriate pneumonia treatment. Addressing these challenges requires improving awareness, enhancing public healthcare trust, and strengthening frontline health worker engagement. This study underscores the role of structured beneficiary involvement in refining pneumonia management strategies to ensure sustainable, community-driven interventions.

**Abstract:**
Psychedelics have garnered great attention in recent years as treatments for major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression due to their ability to alter consciousness and afflicted cognitive processes with lasting effects. Given these unique characteristics and the urgent need for efficacious treatments, psychedelics are being tested for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite promising results and growing interest, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics remain uncharacterized. Using a scoping review approach, we summarize current clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov that utilize classic psychedelics as interventions for SUDs with the goal of understanding the current state and outlook of the field. A second scoping review was conducted using PubMed and SCOPUS databases to identify the relevant publications addressing the pharmacotherapeutic potential of restoring dopamine homeostasis as a novel neurobiological mechanism of psychedelics. This mechanism may blunt drug-seeking behavior, promote drug abstinence, and underlie their clinical relevance for SUD in addition to previously characterized mechanisms.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes significant morbidity, mortality, and growthth faltering among children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. While gut inflammation contributes to growth faltering, the role of ETEC in inflammation remains poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that ETEC-producing heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxins (ST) induced significant inflammation in humans, but LT-only strains are understudied. In this study, we evaluated the intestinal inflammation induced by the LT-only ETEC strain LSN03-016011/A in a human challenge model. Stool samples were analyzed for pre- and post-challenge myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines, ETEC shedding, and ETEC-specific antibody responses. MPO, IL-1{beta}, and IL-8 levels significantly increased post-ETEC challenge, but there was no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Participants protected from severe diarrhea had higher levels of pre-challenge IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-{gamma} compared to those not protected. The MPO and specific cytokine levels were significantly correlated with the seroconversion status to LT and the colonization factor antigen CS17. This study provides evidence that LT-ETEC strain can induce significant intestinal inflammation even in the absence of symptoms, highlighting the need for a vaccine and a better understanding of the impact of ETEC-attributable inflammation on child health in endemic areas.

Author summaryEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of enteric infections, resulting in diarrhea, malnutrition, and other long-term health effects. However, how ETEC - particularly strains that produce only the heat-labile toxin (LT) - can contribute to gut inflammation is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the impact of an LT-ETEC infection on gut inflammation and its relations to ETEC-specific immune responses using samples from participants in a controlled human infection study. We found that LT-ETEC induces a significant level of gut inflammation marker myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1{beta}, when the patients had moderate to severe diarrhea and even when diarrheal symptoms were mild or absent. Gut inflammation level correlated with immune responses to ETEC. These findings suggest that LT-ETEC infection causes significant gut inflammation, which plays a role in immune responses. Our results highlight the need for preventive strategies to reduce the burden of ETEC-related illness, particularly in regions where these infections are common, to prevent broader adverse consequences for gut health and child development.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundThe World Health Organization recommends perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), generally using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to children at high risk of severe P. falciparum malaria. Currently, PMC is given up to age two in perennial transmission settings. However, no recommendation exists for perennial settings with seasonal variation in transmission intensity, recently categorized as  sub-perennial. Tailored chemoprevention strategies are needed to protect children during seasons and ages of highest malaria risk. The seasonal dimension must adequately cover seasonally increased risk periods, alongside interventions that address year-round, lower intensity transmission. We propose a hybrid malaria chemoprevention (HMC) strategy, integrating two delivery components: 1) existing PMC, and 2) additional monthly SP doses during the higher-risk rainy season, ensuring a one-month gap between any two doses.

MethodsUsing a validated individual-based malaria model combined with pharmacological models of drug action (OpenMalaria), we examined the potential public health impact of the proposed HMC (for children 03-24 months), and an age-expanded HMC (referred to as HMC+, for children 03-36 months), under different drug sensitivity, coverage, and prevalence (5-70%) assumptions.

ResultsHMC and HMC+ demonstrated a median (interquartile range) of 2.1 (1.6-2.6), 2.9 (2.2-3.6) times higher efficacy (relative fold increase in burden averted) compared to only PMC against clinical, and 2.0 (0.6-3.4), 3.3 (0.8-5.8) against severe cases, respectively, in children under age three. This led to a median protective efficacy of 31.8% (25.4-38.2%), 44.9% (36.9-52.9%) against clinical, and 16.1% (7.0-25.2%), 26.4% (14.4-38.4%) against severe cases by HMC and HMC+ respectively, across the prevalence, drug sensitivity, and coverage assumptions. We found positive net impact for children under age five years, outweighing a limited potential of delayed malaria across settings.

ConclusionSubstantially increased public health benefits might be achieved by adding seasonally-targeted chemoprevention to current PMC in sub-perennial malaria transmission settings. Effectiveness-implementation studies should generate empirical evidence of public health impact including on the disease burden averted, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the hybrid approach. Such studies should also explore determinants of implementation success including operational feasibility, and acceptability of proposed dosing strategies which will facilitate deployment decisions.

**Abstract:**
Similarities between mental symptoms in Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and those in Post-COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PCVS) have been observed. Based on a representative survey of the population aged 18 to 69 years in Germany (n = 4,628), the epidemiologies of both PCS and PCVS were studied. Mental symptoms of PCS (fatigue/exhaustion/weakness, reduced performance, concentration and memory problems, sleep disorders and depressed mood) were reported by 12.1% and mental symptoms of PCVS were reported by 12.6% of all respondents. Concerning PCS, mental symptoms were reported more often by females compared to males (13.5% versus 10.7%), whereas no gender differences were found for PCVS. With the increasing number of booster vaccinations, mental PCVS decreased from 20.8% with one vaccination to 8.9% with four or more vaccinations. Overall, non-mRNA vaccines did not lead significantly to more mental symptoms than mRNA vaccines (12.9% versus 12.5%) but did differ concerning mental symptom patterns: concentration and memory problems (8.2% versus 3.3%), impaired performance (5.7% versus 4.2%) and sleep disorders (6.6% versus 3.2%) were reported more frequently in non-mRNA vaccines. The reported rate of mental PCVS being 12.6% is clearly higher than the 0.5% recorded by official documentation systems (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI)), suggesting a major underreporting. The data indicate that mental symptoms occurring in both PCS and PCVS are common, making the differential diagnosis between PCS and PCVS, as well as between both PCS and PCVS and independent mental disorders such as depressive disorders, an important but challenging task.

**Abstract:**
Background We aimed to estimate the burden of antibiotic-nonsusceptible non-bacteremic pneumonia and sinusitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in US adults ([&ge;]18 years). Methods We estimated antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococcal sinusitis and non-bacteremic pneumonia incidence as products of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates, serotype distribution, and serotype-specific antimicrobial nonsusceptibility prevalences by antibiotic class and guideline-recommended agents from 2016-2019. We derived pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates from national healthcare utilization surveys and administrative datasets; pneumococcal-attributable attributable percents and serotype distributions from published data; and serotype-specific nonsusceptibility estimates from Active Bacterial Core surveillance data. We evaluated nonsusceptibility for all serotypes and those targeted by 15-, 20- and 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15/20/21). Results An estimated 16.4% (95% confidence interval 12.8-21.4%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 19.0% (14.8-24.9%) of sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes, translating to 243,521 (179,673-333,675) and 1,844,726 (1,070,763-2,904,089) outpatient visits for pneumonia and sinusitis, respectively, and 10,155 (7,542-13,803) pneumonia hospitalizations annually. An estimated 31.2% (26.6-36.3%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 10.5% (9.4-12.0%) of pneumococcal sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]1 outpatient first-line antibiotic agent. Cases attributable to serotypes targeted by PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21 that were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes accounted for 7.4% (4.7-11.1%), 8.5% (5.8-12.1%), and 12.6% (9.2-17.5%) of all non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia cases, and 8.4% (5.3-12.5%), 9.4% (6.2-13.4), and 14.4% (10.4-20.0%) of all pneumococcal sinusitis cases. Conclusions We demonstrated high proportions of antibiotic nonsusceptibility in non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis in US adults. PCVs and antibiotic stewardship may mitigate antibiotic nonsusceptibility in pneumococcal disease.

**Abstract:**
Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a promising non-invasive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), though significant variability exists in patient responses. This quadruple-blind, sham-controlled crossover randomized clinical trial investigated whether clinical improvement was influenced by the spatial selection of stimulation sites or early cardiac rhythm modulations. Seventy-five MDD patients (33 women) were randomized to either personalized stimulation sites, identified via the strongest negative functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the default mode network (DMN), or fixed stimulation at the F3 position of the 10-20 EEG system. Electrocardiograms throughout stimulation monitored heart rate and its variability, focusing on heartbeat deceleration (RR slope) and changes in the root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats (RMSSD). Findings demonstrated that a higher RR slope within the first 45 seconds of stimulation predicted greater clinical improvement at six weeks, while a lower RMSSD change during the first 270 seconds correlated with improvement at one week. However, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between personalized and fixed stimulation sites. This study identified a significant relationship between early heart rhythm modulations and the antidepressant effects of accelerated iTBS in MDD. Although the spatial determination of stimulation sites did not enhance clinical improvement, iTBS-induced changes in cardiac rhythm during early sessions may develop into valuable biomarkers for stratifying patients, enabling more personalized and effective treatment strategies in the future.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: University students frequently experience challenges that affect their sleep quality, including academic stress, lifestyle habits, and socio-demographic factors. Common sleep disturbances, such as delayed sleep onset and poor sleep efficiency, often result in daytime dysfunction and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm. Methods: This cross-sectional study appraised sleep quality among undergraduate students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 530 undergraduate students were purposively selected from three public universities. Participants were chosen through convenience sampling, with students who had contracted COVID-19 during the study excluded from the sample. Results: The mean age of the university students was 21.1 (2.0) years. Regarding PSQI components, the participants showed moderate sleep latency (55.7%) and habitual sleep efficiency (56.0%), with mild levels of sleep disturbances at night (68.1%), daytime dysfunction (51.1%), and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm (48.5%). The global PSQI scores were poor for 59.4% of participants, while 40.6% had good scores, with a mean of 6.5(2.9). Among the students, 44.9% reported fair subjective sleep quality, followed by good (24.7%), very good (18.1%), and poor (12.3%) sleep quality. Lifestyle factors such as class attendance, online media usage, BMI, physical exercise, tea/coffee consumption, and smoking were significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Sleep quality factors like daytime sleep duration, nighttime sleep latency, and sleeping pill usage were also significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Significant associations were found between sleep quality and factors such as age, household income, daily study hours, BMI, daytime sleep, and sleep latency (p<0.05). Conclusion: The study revealed that longer sleep latency, daytime sleep, and sleeping pill usage were related with poorer sleep quality. It also emphasized that sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm were significant predictors of sleep quality.

**Abstract:**
In 2024, the Americas region experienced the largest dengue outbreak on record and Brazil was among the worst affected countries, reporting 6.6 million cases and 6,200 deaths. We report the long-term entomological and epidemiological effectiveness of city-wide deployment of wMel-strain Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti in Niteroi, a city of half a million people in Rio de Janeiro state, where Wolbachia releases across 70% of the urban population in 2017-2019 were expanded to remaining populated areas in 2023. wMel was durably established at [&ge;]95% prevalence in Ae. aegypti populations throughout Niteroi four years post-release, and up to seven years in the earliest release sites. This city-wide Wolbachia coverage provided sustained population-level protection against dengue throughout the five years post-intervention, including during the 2024 epidemic surge, averting an estimated three-quarters of the dengue case burden that would otherwise have been expected in Niteroi in 2024.

**Abstract:**
Background: Patients with rare cancers face substantial challenges due to limited evidence-based treatment options, resulting from sparse clinical trials. Advances in large language models (LLMs) and recommendation algorithms offer new opportunities to utilize all clinical trial information to improve clinical decisions. Methods: We used LLM to systematically extract and standardize more than 100,000 cancer trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Each trial was annotated using a customized scoring system reflecting cancer-treatment interactions based on clinical outcomes and trial attributes. Using this structured data set, we implemented three state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend potentially effective treatments across different cancer types. Results: The LLM-driven data extraction process successfully generated a comprehensive and rigorously curated database from fragmented clinical trial information, covering 78 cancer types and 5,315 distinct interventions. Recommendation models demonstrated high predictive accuracy (cross-validated RMSE: {0.49--0.62}) and identified clinically meaningful new treatments for melanoma, independently validated by oncology experts. Conclusions: Our study establishes a proof of concept demonstrating that the combination of LLMs with sophisticated recommendation algorithms can systematically identify novel and clinically plausible cancer treatments. This integrated approach may accelerate the identification of effective therapies for rare cancers, ultimately improving patient outcomes by generating evidence-based treatment recommendations where traditional data sources remain limited.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: Though dementia is a serious illness that progresses over many years, little is known about the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Objective: To test the impact of a virtual, nurse-led primary palliative care intervention on older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Methods: This randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed to compare the impact of {usual care} to {usual care plus a virtual, nurse-led, primary palliative care intervention} on community- dwelling, chronically ill older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Results: We hypothesize that patients in the virtual nurse intervention arm will have their primary palliative care needs identified and fulfilled compared to those in the usual care arm. Conclusions: Identification of the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of and/or with MCI, mild or moderate dementia will help refine intervention to effectively provide primary palliative care in a timely manner to these patients.

**Abstract:**
Introduction. HIV testing and treatment coverage among men in Zambia remains suboptimal, partly due to lower healthcare-seeking behavior compared to women. To address this gap, Circle of Hope (CoH), a local faith-based organization funded by the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), developed the community post (CP) model. CPs are staffed by multi-disciplinary teams that provide HIV-testing, anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) testing. This analysis assesses the impact of these CPs on HIV case finding, ART initiation, and VL suppression among men. Methods. Routine program data reported to PEPFAR by CoH Zambia were analyzed for two periods: pre-COVID 19 (April 2018-March 2020) and during the pandemic (April 2020-March 2022). Indicators included the number of HIV tests conducted and positive results received (overall and for index testing specifically), ART initiation among men living with HIV (MLHIV), 12-month retention on ART, and the proportion of clients with VL suppression (<1000 copies/mL). Results. Between April 2018 and March 2022, the number of CPs expanded from 9 to 38 across Zambia. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, men continued to represent a substantial share of clients: 49.5% to 41.4% of those tested, 38.5% to 42.0% of those diagnosed (p<0.001), and 38.9% to 43.3% of those initiated on ART (p<0.001). The number of men on ART rose from 3,320 (38%) to 13,580 (43%, p<0.000001). Retention and VL suppression among men also remained high, increasing slightly from 94% to 97% and 95% to 96%, respectively. Over 6,000 men were diagnosed through index testing services, with percent positivity consistently high, ranging from 54.4% to 61.1% (p<0.001). Conclusions. The CoH model was successful at identifying and linking MLHIV to HIV treatment services and assisting them to achieve and maintain viral suppression even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding this community-based model may help close HIV testing and treatment gaps among men and advance HIV epidemic control in Zambia and beyond.

**Abstract:**
Background There is a need for person-centred outcome measures (PCOMs) in tuberculosis (TB) clinical trials to capture the priorities of affected individuals relating to both disease and treatment, alongside the traditional efficacy and safety analysis. Methods We conducted a literature search to identify existing health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) measurement tools and instances where they have been used to evaluate TB disease in interventional studies. DR-TB survivors were recruited for focus group discussions in South Africa, Mongolia and Georgia to determine the most important aspects of disease and treatment experience from their perspective. A second round of focus groups then worked to prioritise these items and group them within different domains. A panel of researchers and academic clinicians evaluated existing PCOMs identified in the literature search using a published framework. Finally, an assessment was carried out by a experienced TB Community Advisory Group members for appropriateness and acceptability, and clinical trial site investigators for feasibility of the PCOMs. Results The initial round of 9 focus groups involving 57 participants identified priority items grouped under the fields overall quality of life, disease symptoms, and treatment and side effects. In the second round of four focus groups involving 26 participants, the highest ranked items under overall quality of life were duration of treatment, experience of swallowing pills, and how long before being able to contribute to the household. The most important symptoms were coughing, weight loss and breathlessness. The highest ranked side effects were nausea/vomiting, skin colour changes, and nerve problems. FACIT-TB was the only measurement tool assessed that was rated good for appropriateness, and excellent, good or fair in all other fields by community representatives, researchers and clinical trial site staff. Conclusions The FACIT-TB measurement tool was identified as the most appropriate disease-specific PCOM currently available for use in clinical trials investigating novel DR-TB therapeutics.

**Abstract:**
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) 2024 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment guidelines expand eligibility for nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment in individuals with chronic HBV infection. For countries to implement these guidelines, there is a critical need to understand the population who are treatment eligible. While HBV drug resistance (HBVDR) is uncommon, monitoring for any potential resistance is a relevant public health consideration. Methods: We studied a population in rural Uganda to describe the proportion of individuals eligible for treatment based on the 2024 WHO treatment guidelines. We determined how this proportion varies according to the eligibility criteria used, comparing the performance of different assessment tools. We calculated Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet Ratio Index; APRI, Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase-to-Platelet Ratio; GPR and transient elastography; TE and performed HBV sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology to determine the prevalence of HBVDR in treatment naive and treatment experienced individuals. Results: In this cohort, 24/63 (38%) individuals with CHB were eligible for treatment. This fell to 14/63 (22%) in a hypothetical scenario where TE was not available for the assessment of liver fibrosis. We demonstrate a lack of concordance between non-invasive tests (NIT) of liver disease in treatment-naive HBV mono-infected individuals. An APRI cut-off of 0.5 had a sensitivity of 23.0% for predicting a TE score of >7 kPa (F2 fibrosis). Sensitivity for detecting F2 fibrosis was increased to 38.5% using an APRI cut off of 0.36, and to 46.2% using the GPR. We did not identify any HBVDR in the HBV mono-infected treatment-naive population (n=58). 24/210 individuals were living with HIV/HBV coinfection; HBV was sequenced in 5 of these of whom 2 had genomic evidence of nucleos(t)ide analogue resistance (rt180M/204V). Conclusions: While the WHO 2024 treatment criteria offer an opportunity to expand access to care, there is a need to determine how assessment tools differ in determination of eligibility in different settings. HBVDR remains uncommon but more research is needed to understand its prevalence and clinical impact in African populations.

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Abstract:**
Background: The growing availability of large genomic datasets presents an opportunity to discover new metabolic pathways and enzymatic reactions useful for industrial or synthetic biological applications. Efforts to identify new enzyme functions in this huge number of sequences cannot be achieved without the help of bioinformatics tools and the development of new strategies. Standard methods for assigning a biological function to a gene are based on sequence similarity. However, another way is to mine databases to identify conserved gene clusters (i.e. syntenies). Indeed in prokaryotic genomes, genes involved in the same pathway are frequently encoded in a single locus with an operonic organisation. This Genomic Context (GC) conservation is considered as a reliable indicator of functional relationships, and thus is a promising approach to improve the gene function prediction. Methods. Here we present NetSyn (Network Synteny), a tool which aims to cluster protein sequences according to the similarity of their genomic context rather than their sequence similarity. Starting from a set of protein sequences of interest, NetSyn retrieves neighbouring genes from the corresponding genomes as well as their protein sequences. Homologous protein families are then computed to measure GC conservation between each pair of input sequences using a GC conservation score. A network is created where nodes represent the input proteins and edges the fact that two proteins share a common GC. The weight of the edges corresponds to the synteny conservation score. The network is then partitioned into clusters of proteins sharing a high degree of synteny conservation. Results. As a proof of concept, we used NetSyn on two different datasets. The first one is made of homologous sequences of an enzyme family (the BKACE family, previously named DUF849) to divide it into sub-families of specific activities. NetSyn was able to go a step further by providing additional subfamilies to those already published. The second dataset corresponds to a set of non-homologous proteins consisting of different Glycosyl Hydrolases (GH) with the aim of interconnecting them and finding conserved operon-like genomic structures. NetSyn was able to find a locus composed of 3 non homologous glycosyl hydrolases, involved in the degradation of xyloglucan, in 162 genomes. Discussion. NetSyn is able to cluster proteins according to their genomic context, making it possible to establish functional links between proteins without considering their sequence similarity alone. We showed that NetSyn is efficient in exploring large protein families to define iso-functional groups. It can also highlight functional interactions between proteins from different families and predicts new conserved genomic structures that have not yet been experimentally characterised. NetSyn can also be useful for pinpointing annotation errors that have been propagated across databases, and for suggesting annotations on proteins currently annotated as "unknown". NetSyn is freely available at https://github.com/labgem/netsyn.

**Abstract:**
The locus coeruleus (LC), the major source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is among the earliest site of pathology in both Alzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD), and it undergoes catastrophic degeneration later in both disorders. Dysregulation of the LC is thought to contribute to prodromal symptoms of AD and PD such as anxiety and sleep disturbances, while frank LC loss promotes cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms responsible for its selective vulnerability are unknown. It has been suggested that neuromelanin (NM) pigment contributes to LC susceptibility, but causal relationships have been difficult to test because rodents do not naturally produce NM. Here, we report that viral-mediated expression of human tyrosinase induced pigmentation in mouse LC neurons that recapitulated key features of natural primate NM. One week of NM accumulation resulted in LC neuron hyperactivity, reduced tissue NE levels, transcriptional changes, and anxiety-like behavior. By 6-10 weeks, NM accumulation was associated with severe LC neuron neurodegeneration and microglial engulfment of the pigment granules, while the anxiety-like behavior abated. These phenotypes are reminiscent of LC dysfunction and cell death in AD and PD, validating this model for studying the consequences of NM accumulation in the LC as it relates to neurodegenerative disease.

Significance StatementAlzheimers disease (AD) and Parkinsons disease (PD) are two of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Because therapies that cure or even prevent their progression are lacking, research is focused on the identifying earliest signs of disease as targets for diagnosis and treatment. The locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of the neurotransmitter n norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is one of the first brain regions affected in both AD and PD. LC dysregulation promotes prodromal AD and PD symptoms, while its degeneration accelerates disease progression. Here we identify neuromelanin (NM) pigment as a LC vulnerability factor that induces neuronal hyperactivity followed by cell death. Approaches that mitigate NM accumulation and toxicity may target the earliest phases of neurodegenerative disease.

**Abstract:**
Brain pericytes maintain the blood-brain barrier (BBB), secrete neurotrophic factors and clear toxic proteins. Their loss in neurological disorders leads to BBB breakdown, neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Therefore, cell therapy to replace lost pericytes holds potential to restore impaired cerebrovascular and brain functions. However, the molecular composition and function of human iPSC-derived brain pericytes (iPSC-PC) remains poorly characterized. Here, we show by a quantitative analysis of 8,344 proteins and 20,572 phosphopeptides that iPSC-PC share 96% of total proteins and 98% of protein phosphorylation sites with primary human brain pericytes. This includes cell adhesion and tight junction proteins, transcription factors, and different protein kinase families of the human kinome. In pericyte-deficient mice, iPSC-PC home to host brain capillaries to form hybrid human-mouse microvessels with ligand-receptor associations. They repair BBB leaks and protect against neuron loss, which we show requires PDGRFB and pleiotrophin. They also clear Alzheimer's amyloid-beta; and tau neurotoxins via lipoprotein receptor. Thus, iPSC-PC may have potential as a replacement therapy for pericyte-deficient neurological disorders.

**Abstract:**
Disease phenotypes can be described as the consequence of interactions among molecular processes that are altered beyond resilience. Here, we address the challenge of assessing the possible alteration of intra- and inter-cellular molecular interactions among gene sets, which are intended to represent processes and or cellular phenotypes. We present an approach, designated as "Ulisse", which complements the existing methods of enrichment analysis and cell-cell communication analysis. It can be applied to a gene list as well as multiple ranked gene lists, typically derived in the context of omics or multi-omics studies. The approach highlights the presence of alterations in those components that control the interactions between processes or cells. Crosstalk quantification is supported by two null models. Further, the approach provides an additional way of identifying the genes associated with the phenotype. As a proof-of-concept, we applied Ulisse to study the alteration of pathway crosstalks and cell-cell communications in triple negative breast cancer samples, based on single-cell RNA sequencing. In conclusion, our work supports the usefulness of crosstalk analysis as an additional instrument in the "toolkit" of biomedical research for translating complex biological data into actionable insights.

**Abstract:**
In the human brain, the alpha rhythm in occipital cortex and the mu rhythm in sensorimotor cortex are among the most prominent rhythms, with both rhythms functionally implicated in gating modality-specific information. Separation of these rhythms is non-trivial due to the spatial mixing of these oscillations in sensor space. Using a computationally efficient processing pipeline requiring no manual data cleaning, we isolated alpha and/or mu rhythms from electroencephalography recordings performed on 1605 children aged 5-18. Using the extracted time series for each rhythm, we characterized the waveform shape on a cycle-by-cycle basis and examined whether and how the waveform shape differs across development. We demonstrate that alpha and mu rhythms both exhibit nonsinusoidal waveform shape that changes significantly across development, in addition to the known large changes in oscillatory frequency. This dataset also provided an opportunity to assess oscillatory measures for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found no differences in the resting-state features of these alpha-band rhythms for either ADHD or ASD in comparison to typically developing participants in this dataset. While waveform shape is ignored by traditional Fourier spectral analyses, these nonsinusoidal properties may be informative for building more constrained generative models for different types of alpha-band rhythms, yielding more specific insight into their generation.

**Abstract:**
Perceptual decision-making is the process by which an animal uses sensory stimuli to choose an action or mental proposition. This process is thought to be mediated by neurons organized as attractor networks1,2. However, whether attractor dynamics underlie decision behavior and the complex neuronal responses remains unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings from hundreds of neurons, together with an unsupervised, deep learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in frontal cortex and striatum of rats while the subjects accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes, the first dominated by sensory inputs, and the second dominated by the autonomous dynamics, with flow in a direction (i.e., "neural mode") largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that the transition to the second regime corresponds to the moment of decision commitment. We developed a simplified model that approximates the coupled transition in dynamics and neural mode and allows precise inference, from each trials large-scale neural population activity, of a putative neurally-inferred time of commitment ("nTc") on that trial. The simplified model captures diverse and complex single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping3-5, as well as trial-averaged curved trajectories6-8, and reveals distinctions between brain regions. The estimated nTc times were not time-locked to stimulus onset or offset, or to response onset, but were instead broadly distributed across trials. If nTc marks the moment of decision commitment, sensory evidence before nTc should affect the decision, while evidence afterward should not. Behavioral analysis of trials aligned to their estimated nTc times confirmed this prediction. Our results show that the formation of a perceptual choice involves a rapid, coordinated transition in both the dynamical regime and the neural mode of the decision process that corresponds to commitment to a decision, and suggest this moment as a useful entry point for dissecting mechanisms underlying rapid changes in internal state.

**Abstract:**
Microbes exhibit precise control over their composition and geometry in order to adapt and grow in diverse environments. However, the mechanisms that orchestrate this simultaneous regulation, and how they are causally linked, remains poorly understood. In this work, we derive and experimentally test a biophysical model of cell size regulation in Escherichia coli which relates the cellular surface-to-volume ratio to the total macromolecular composition and partitioning of the proteome between cellular compartments. Central to this model is the observation that the macromolecular density of the cytoplasm and the protein density within the cell membranes are maintained at a constant ratio across growth conditions. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, single-cell microscopy, and biochemical assays, we show this model quantitatively predicts a non-linear relationship between the surface-to-volume ratio, proteome localization, and the total ribosome content of the cell. This model holds under perturbations of intracellular ppGpp concentrations-thereby changing the ribosomal content-demonstrating that cellular geometry is not strictly determined by the cellular growth rate. These findings provide a biophysical link between the coregulation of proteome organization and cellular geometry, offering a quantitative framework for understanding bacterial size regulation across conditions.

## Modeling the growth of cytosolic TDP-43 inclusion bodies and accumulated neurotoxicity of misfolded oligomers in neurons

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a mathematical model for the growth of transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) inclusion bodies in neuron soma. The parameter representing accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers is also introduced. The models equations allow for the numerical calculation of the concentrations of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, as well as free TDP-43 oligomers and those deposited into inclusion bodies. By simulating the deposition of free oligomers into inclusion bodies, the model predicts the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies. An approximate solution to the model equations is derived for the scenario where protein degradation machinery is dysfunctional, leading to infinite half-lives for TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and both free and deposited oligomers. This solution, valid for large times, predicts that the inclusion body radius increases proportionately to the cube root of time, while accumulated neurotoxicity increases linearly with time. To the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to model the relationship between the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies and time, as well as the first to introduce the concept of accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers. The sensitivity analysis of the approximate solution indicates that the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity are independent of the kinetic constants at large timescales. While the numerical solution of the full mathematical model continues to work with finite half-lives, the approximate solution becomes invalid for scenarios with physiologically relevant (finite) half-lives of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and free misfolded oligomers. In contrast to the scenario with infinite half-lives, the numerical solution reveals that for different values of the kinetic constants, the curves representing the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity converge to distinct curves as time progresses.

**Abstract:**
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is typically treated empirically with vancomycin, with therapy later tailored based on susceptibility results. However, these tests occur before vancomycin exposure and do not account for adaptation during empiric treatment that can alter S. aureus susceptibility to first-line drugs. To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU, impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes. Our findings suggest a probabilistic approach to antimicrobial therapy, advocating for rapid genomic diagnostics alongside susceptibility testing to better anticipate and respond to evolutionary changes.

SignificanceAntibiotic treatment can influence bacterial evolution, altering the effectiveness of subsequent therapies by inducing collateral resistance or sensitivity. This study reveals that evolution toward vancomycin-intermediate resistance in the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus proceeds through at least two distinct evolutionary pathways: one characterized by alterations in cell wall metabolism and another by changes in global stress response. These adaptive trajectories result in contrasting collateral sensitivities to first-line antibiotics. By introducing the Collateral Response Score, we assess the uncertainty in these outcomes, providing a probabilistic framework to evaluate how past antibiotic exposure shapes future treatment responses. Further validation studies are needed; however, we believe that improved forecasting of pathogen evolution can enhance antibiotic stewardship, inform therapeutic decisions, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

**Abstract:**
Recent studies have established a reciprocal causal link between aging and the activation of transposable elements, characterized in particular by a de-repression of LINE-1 retrotransposons. These LINE-1 elements represent 21% of the human genome, but only a minority of these sequences retain the coding potential essential for their mobility. LINE-1 encoded proteins can induce cell toxicity implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, our knowledge of the expression and localization of LINE-1-encoded proteins in the central nervous system is limited. Using a novel approach combining atlas-based brain mapping with deep-learning algorithms on large-scale pyramidal brain images, we unveil a heterogeneous, neuron-predominant and widespread ORF1p expression throughout the murine brain at steady-state. In aged mice, ORF1p expression increases significantly which is corroborated in human post-mortem dopaminergic neurons by an increase in young LINE-1 elements including those with open reading frames. Mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous mouse ORF1p revealed novel, neuron-specific protein interactors. These findings contribute to a comprehensive description of the dynamics of LINE-1 and ORF1p expression in the brain at steady-state and in aging and provide insights on ORF1p protein interactions in the brain.

**Abstract:**
Proteobacterial methanotrophs are dependent on the oxidation of methane for ATP production and assimilation of carbon into biomass. Interestingly, some types of gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs thrive in oxygen-depleted zones of lakes and other aquatic ecosystems despite their reliance on oxygen to support methane oxidation. The model gammaproteobacterial methanotroph, Methylomonas denitrificans FJG1, oxidizes methane coupled to nitrate reduction under hypoxia and highly upregulates its expression of bacteriohemerythrin (Bhr). Bhr is a homolog of eukaryotic hemerythrin, which is a protein associated with oxygen binding. Ten bhr homologs were identified in the genome of M. denitrificans FJG1, requiring phylogenetic and gene expression analyses to pinpoint which homolog is likely responsible for delivering oxygen to support methane oxidation to under low oxygen conditions. This study examined the prevalence and phylogeny of the 10 bhr homologs from M. denitrificans FJG1 in the genomes of other methanotrophs and across the Bacteria. The homolog denoted "bhr-00" was specific to methanotroph genomes, was highly expressed in M. denitrificans FJG1 under hypoxia, and its predicted structure was nearly identical to a purified oxygen-scavenging hemerythrin protein from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath. Other bhr homologs upregulated from denitrifying cultures of M. denitrificans FJG1 included those with gene neighborhoods related to oxygen sensing, denitrification and chemotaxis. Together, this study uncovered potential multifunctional roles of bacteriohemerythrin genes of M. denitrificans FJG1 under low oxygen conditions and identified the bhr homolog that most likely enables and supports oxygen delivery to methane monooxygenase enzymes in anoxic ecosystems.

**Abstract:**
Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker[-&gt;]Brainstem[-&gt;]Thalamus[-&gt;]Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking activity upon multi-whisker stimulation, resembling the stable response pattern observed in barrels. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions.

**Abstract:**
The Global Pandemic Lineage (GPL) of the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been described as a main driver of amphibian extinctions on nearly every continent. Near complete genome of three Bd-GPL strains have enabled studies of the pathogen but the genomic features that set Bd-GPL apart from other Bd lineages is not well understood due to a lack of high-quality genome assemblies and annotations from other lineages. We used long-read DNA sequencing to assemble high-quality genomes of three Bd-BRAZIL isolates and one non-pathogen outgroup species Polyrhizophydium stewartii (Ps) strain JEL0888, and compared these to genomes of previously sequenced Bd-GPL strains. The Bd-BRAZIL assemblies range in size between 22.0 and 26.1 Mb and encode 8495-8620 protein-coding genes for each strain. Our pan-genome analysis provided insight into shared and lineage-specific gene content. The core genome of Bd consists of 6278 conserved gene families, with 202 Bd-BRAZIL and 172 Bd-GPL specific gene families. We discovered gene copy number variation in pathogenicity gene families between Bd-BRAZIL and Bd-GPL strains though none were consistently expanded in Bd-GPL or Bd-BRAZIL strains. Comparison within the Batrachochytrium genus and two closely related non-pathogenic saprophytic chytrids identified variation in sequence and protein domain counts. We further test these new Bd-BRAZIL genomes to assess their utility as reference genomes for transcriptome alignment and analysis. Our analysis examines the genomic variation between strains in Bd-BRAZIL and Bd-GPL and offers insights into the application of these genomes as reference genomes for future studies.

**Abstract:**
Deep learning-based compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction models are promising in the field of molecular biology, particularly for facilitating the drug discovery process. In practical applications, CPI models should achieve a high generalization performance, quantify prediction confidence, and ensure explainability. Here, we propose ChemGLaM, a chemical genomics language model for reliable and explainable CPI predictions, by addressing these three crucial aspects. ChemGLaM integrates independently pre-trained chemical and protein language models through an interaction block with a cross-attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in predicting novel CPIs. Incorporating uncertainty estimation and attention visualization enables ChemGLaM to enhance the success rate of virtual screening and to provide molecular insights into CPIs. Furthermore, we demonstrate its practical applicability by constructing a public database for large-scale CPI predictions and enabling drug/target exploration for candidate treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ChemGLaM represents a significant step toward overcoming the challenges of AI-driven drug discovery and addressing unmet medical needs.

**Abstract:**
In rodents, estrogens aromatized from androgens in the brain are essential for the development of male-typical behaviors. In many other vertebrates including humans and teleost fish, however, androgens facilitate these behaviors directly via the androgen receptor without aromatization into estrogens. Here we report that mutagenesis-derived male medaka fish lacking Cyp19a1b (a subtype of aromatase predominantly expressed in the brain) exhibit severely impaired male-typical mating and aggression, despite elevated brain androgen levels. These phenotypes can be rescued by estrogen administration, indicating that brain-derived estrogens are pivotal for male-typical behaviors even in teleosts. Our results further suggest that these estrogens facilitate male-typical behaviors by potentiating androgen action in the brain via the direct stimulation of androgen receptor transcription, thereby revealing a previously unappreciated mode of action of brain-derived estrogens. We additionally show that female fish lacking Cyp19a1b are less receptive to male courtship and conversely court other females, highlighting the significance of brain-derived estrogens in establishing sex-typical behaviors in both sexes.

**Abstract:**
The spatial arrangement of microtubules in the cytoskeleton in the cells of protists has been used for decades for taxonomy and phylogenetic inference at various levels. In contrast, the protein composition of non-microtubular structures is mostly unknown. Exceptions are system I fibers in algae, which are built of striated fiber assemblins (SFAs). Interestingly, SFAs are also components of a range of other, dissimilar structures, playing a role in the cortex of ciliates, cell division in apicomplexans, and adhesion of the parasite Giardia to the intestine. In a broad bioinformatic survey, we show the existence of three ancestral eukaryotic paralogues of SFA, and note that they are present in all "typical excavates:" small heterotrophic flagellates bearing a ventral feeding groove. In one representative, Paratrimastix pyriformis, we detected two SFA paralogs using specific antibodies and expansion microscopy. We show that they co-localize selectively with several microtubules and structures attached to the basal body of the posterior flagellum, namely the right microtubular root, B-fiber, C-fiber, and composite fiber. We demonstrate that one of the paralogs self-assembles in vitro into striated filaments which, under negative staining and cryo-electron microscopy, resemble system I fibers as seen in previous studies. Given the facts that all three SFA paralogs appear to be ancestral to most eukaryotic lineages, as is probably the morphology of "typical excavates" with a ventral groove, we speculate that a role in the development or function of the feeding apparatus of the common ancestor of most if not all eukaryotes was the primary function of these proteins.

**Abstract:**
Understanding how the eyes, head, and hands coordinate in natural contexts is a critical challenge in visuomotor coordination research, often constrained by sedentary tasks, cued actions, or restricted settings. To address this gap, we conducted an experiment where participants could self-generate pick-and-place actions on a life-size shelf in a virtual environment, recording concurrent gaze and body movements. Subjects exhibited intricate translation and rotation movements of the eyes, head, and hands during the task. We employed a time-dependent principal component analysis to study the relationship between the movements of the eyes, head, and hands relative to the onset of the action. We reduced the overall dimensionality into 2D representations, capturing up to 65% of the movement variance just in time with the actions. Our analysis revealed a synergistic coupling of the eye-head and eye-hand systems, as well as a strong coupling within the head-hand system. The eyes synchronized with the head and hands close to the action onset, with variations in coupling observed in horizontal and vertical planes, indicating distinct mechanisms for coordination in the brain. Crucially, the head and hands remained tightly coupled throughout the observation period, suggesting a shared neural code driving these effectors. Notably, the low-dimensional representations of the eye-head-hand movement vectors showed maximum predictive accuracy of the actions location ~200ms before the action onset, highlighting just-in-time coordination among the three effectors. Furthermore, the predictive accuracy was significantly influenced by the location of the upcoming action. Our study emphasizes the differential visuomotor control subject to the task structure, providing insights into the dynamic interplay of eye, head, and hand movements during natural behavior.

NEW & NOTEWORTHYStudying natural, self-initiated, complex visuomotor coordination, we observe low-dimensional dynamics with distinct patterns along horizontal and vertical axes. The eyes horizontal movement showed notable independence, aligning with head and hand movements just in time for action. Notably, around critical events, the dimensionality of the complex movements is further reduced, indicating dynamic correspondence of eye-head-hand coordination.

**Abstract:**
Stimulation of specific cell groups under different network regimes (e.g., spontaneous activity or sensory-evoked activity) can provide insights into the neural dynamics of cortical columns. While these protocols are challenging to perform experimentally, modelling can serve as a powerful tool for such explorations. Using detailed electrophysiological and anatomical data from mouse V1, we built a novel spiking network model of a cortical column, which incorporates pyramidal cells and three distinct interneuron types (PV, SST, and VIP cells, specified per lamina), as well as the dynamic and voltage-dependent properties of AMPA, GABA, and NMDA receptors. We first demonstrate that thalamocortical feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) stimuli arriving in the column have opposite effects, leading to net columnar excitation and inhibition respectively and revealing translaminar gain control via full-column inhibition by layer 6. We then perturb one cell group (i.e. a cell type in a specific layer) at a time and observe the effects on other cell groups under distinct network states: spontaneous, feedforward-driven, feedback-driven, and a combination of feedforward and feedback. Our findings reveal that when a given group is perturbed, the columnar response varies significantly based on its state, with strong sensory feedforward input decreasing columnar sensitivity to all perturbations and feedback input serving as modulator of intra columnar interactions. Given that activity changes within specific neuronal populations are difficult to predict a priori in experiments, our model may constitute a useful tool to predict outcomes of perturbations and assist in experimental design.

Author SummaryIn this study, we explored how stimulating specific groups of neurons under different conditions (spontaneous or stimulus-evoked states) can help us understand the dynamics of visual cortical columns in mouse cortex. We developed a data-constrained model of a cortical column that includes several cell types (excitatory neurons as well as multiple inhibitory neuron types) and synaptic receptors. Our findings reveal that signals coming from higher brain areas (feedback input) and sensory input (feedforward input) have different impacts on the column: sensory inputs generally increase activity within the column, while feedback tends to decrease it. We then considered input targeting one cell type at a time to see how it affects the internal dynamics. Our results show that neural responses to selected input vary depending on whether the cortical column is in a resting state or being stimulated by feedforward input or feedback input. This model is a useful tool for predicting the outcomes of these cell interactions, which can help in planning real-world experiments and understanding how our brain processes information.

**Abstract:**
Synapses formed by equivalent pairs of pre- and postsynaptic neurons have similar electrophysiological characteristics, belonging to the same type. However, these are generally confined to microscopic brain regions, precluding their proteomic analysis. This fact has greatly limited our ability to investigate the molecular basis of synaptic physiology. We introduce a procedure to characterise the synaptic proteome of microscopic brain regions and explore the molecular diversity among the synapses forming the trisynaptic circuit in the hippocampus. While we observe a remarkable proteomic diversity among these synapses, we also report that proteins involved in the regulation of the function of glutamate receptors are differentially expressed in all of them. Moreover, neuron-specific gene expression programs would contribute to their regulation. Here, we introduce a combined proteomics and transcriptomics analysis uncovering a previously unrecognised neuron-specific control of synaptic proteome diversity, directed towards the regulation of glutamate receptors and their regulatory proteins.

**Abstract:**
Single-cell multiomic techniques have sparked immense interest in developing a comprehensive multi-modal map of diverse neuronal cell types and their brain wide projections. However, investigating the spatial organization, transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of brain wide projection neurons is hampered by the lack of efficient and easily adoptable tools. Here we introduce Projection-TAGs, a retrograde AAV platform that allows multiplex tagging of projection neurons using RNA barcodes. By using Projection-TAGs, we performed multiplex projection tracing of the mouse cortex and high-throughput single-cell profiling of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of the cortical projection neurons. Projection-TAGs can be leveraged to obtain a snapshot of activity-dependent recruitment of distinct projection neurons and their molecular features in the context of a specific stimulus. Given its flexibility, usability, and compatibility, we envision that Projection-TAGs can be readily applied to build a comprehensive multi-modal map of brain neuronal cell types and their projections.

## Mimicking opioid analgesia in cortical pain circuits

**Abstract:**
The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural dynamics to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviors and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep-learning behavioral analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an unpleasant, affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective-motivational behaviors without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic mu-opioid receptor promoter to drive chemogenetic inhibition. This opioid-mimetic gene therapy recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain, thereby offering a new strategy for precision pain management targeting a key nociceptive cortical opioid circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

**Abstract:**
The events that lead to protein misfolding diseases are not fully understood. Many proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., TDP43) interact with nucleic acids, including RNA G-quadruplexes. In this work, we investigate whether RNA G-quadruplexes play a role in TDP43 condensation in biophysical and cellular models. We find that G-quadruplexes modulate TDP43 aggregation in vitro and condensation in multiple cell types, including yeast, HEK293T, and motor-neuron-like NSC-34 cells. In yeast cells, treatment with G-quadruplexes causes increased TDP43 accumulation in cells before cellular death. In HEK293T cells expressing TDP43, incubation with G-quadruplex-binding small molecules causes an increase in G4 stability that also stabilizes TDP43 and reduces TDP43 condensation induced by proteasomal or oxidative stress. Finally, in NSC-34 cells overexpressing exogenous TDP43, we show that G-quadruplexes co-localize with TDP43 condensates under stress conditions and treatment with G-quadruplex-binding small molecules decreases TDP43-mediated toxicity. Together, these findings suggest that a novel future approach to explore for treating protein misfolding diseases may be to target specific RNA structures such as G-quadruplexes.

**Abstract:**
Archaeal tubulin-like cytoskeletal protein CetZ1 is required for rod-cell morphogenesis during the development of motile cells in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. It has been unknown whether CetZ1 or its paralogs contribute to motility solely through the effects of rod cell shape on swimming speed, or in other ways too. Here, we found that CetZ1 also plays significant roles in the polar assembly of the motility machinery including the archaellum base protein ArlD1, the chemotaxis sensory array adapter CheW1, and signal transducer CheY. Notably, overexpression of cetZ1 or cetZ2 differentially influenced motility and the polar assembly of the motility machinery, but caused no detectable change in the rod shape of motile cells. CetZ1 localized at the poles of motile cells, but its imperfect co-localization with the motility machineries suggests it may promote their assembly indirectly, such as via a role in organisation or structure of the cell poles.

**Abstract:**
Ion channels are necessary for proper water and nutrient absorption in the intestine, thereby supporting cellular metabolism and organismal growth. While a role for Na+ co-transporters and pumps in intestinal nutrient absorption is well defined, how individual K+ uniporters function in this process is poorly understood. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that a gain-of-function mutation in twk-26, which encodes a two-pore domain K+ ion channel orthologous to human KCNK3, facilitates nutrient absorption and suppresses the metabolic and developmental defects caused by loss of DRL-1/FLR-4 signaling. Mutations in drl-1 and flr-4, which encode two unique kinases that are components of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the downstream flr-1 Na+ ion channel, cause severe growth defects, reduced lipid storage, and a dramatic increase in autophagic lysosomes, which mirror dietary restriction phenotypes. We reveal that this dietary restriction phenotype is likely the result of impaired intestinal amino acid absorption, which is restored upon activation of TWK-26. Furthermore, we show that loss of flr-4 disrupts intracellular and extracellular pH gradients, suggesting that the FLR-4 pathway may be necessary to maintain intestinal ion homeostasis and facilitate nutrient absorption. The altered pH gradients in the flr-4 mutant are partially restored by activation of TWK-26, demonstrating a novel role for this K+ ion channel in governing intestinal physiology and metabolism.

**Abstract:**
In the canonical interpretation of dopaminergic neuron activity during Pavlovian conditioning, initially cell firing is triggered by unexpected rewards. Upon learning, activation instead follows the reward-predictive conditioned stimulus, and when expected rewards are withheld, firing is inhibited. However, little is known about dopaminergic neuron activity during the actual learning process in complex operant tasks. Here, we recorded optogenetically identified dopaminergic neurons of ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice training in multiple, successive operant sensory discrimination tasks. A delay between nose-poke choices and trial outcome signals (for reward or punishment) probed for predictive activity. During training, but prior to criterion performance, firing rates signaled correct versus incorrect choices, but prior to outcome signals. Thus, the neurons predicted whether choices would be rewarded, despite the animals' subthreshold behavioral performance. Surprisingly, these neurons also fired after reward delivery, as if the rewards had been unexpected according to the canonical view, but activity was inhibited after punishment signals, as if the reward had been expected after all. These inconsistencies suggest revision of theoretical formulations of dopaminergic neuronal activity to embody multiple roles in temporal difference learning and actor-critic models. Furthermore, on training trials when these neurons predicted that a given choice was correct and would be rewarded, surprisingly, the mice adhered to other non-rewarded and untrained task strategies (e.g., spatial alternation). The DA neurons' reward prediction activity could serve as critic signals for the choices just made. This consistent with the notion that the brain must reconcile multiple Bayesian belief representations during learning.

**Abstract:**
Target of Rapamycin (TOR) complexes and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are crucial signaling hubs that coordinate adaptive responses to environmental inputs. While GPCR-mediated regulation of TOR has been extensively studied, little is known about TOR-mediated regulation of GPCRs. Here, we establish TOR as a regulator of GPCR signaling via its control of receptor endocytosis in the yeast mating system. By pairing fluorescence microscopy with yeast genetic approaches, we identify the machinery that bridges TOR nutrient sensing to GPCR internalization. Furthermore, we find that autophagic machinery is employed during mating to deliver active receptor to the vacuole (lysosome), suppressing the mating pathway. These results demonstrate that TOR regulates the localization and signaling of the yeast mating GPCR in both ligand-dependent and -independent contexts. These pathways are highly conserved, suggesting that TOR-regulation of GPCRs may be a broadly conserved mechanism for integrating competing signals involving metabolic state and external communications.

**Abstract:**
The language of biology, encoded in DNA, RNA, and proteins, forms the foundation of life but remains challenging to decode due to its complexity. Traditional computational methods often struggle to integrate information across these molecules, limiting a comprehensive understanding of biological systems. Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with pre-trained models offer new possibilities for interpreting biological language. Here, we introduce LucaOne, a pre-trained foundation model trained on nucleic acid and protein sequences from 169,861 species. Through large-scale data integration and semi-supervised learning, LucaOne demonstrates an understanding of key biological principles, such as DNA-Protein translation. Using few-shot learning, it effectively comprehends the central dogma of molecular biology and performs competitively on tasks involving DNA, RNA, or protein inputs. Our results highlight the potential of unified foundation models to address complex biological questions, providing an adaptable framework for bioinformatics research and enhancing the interpretation of life's complexity.

**Abstract:**
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer that is unresponsive to hormonal therapies. One potential TNBC-specific therapeutic target is NQO1, as it is highly expressed in many TNBC patients and lowly expressed in non-cancer tissues. Here we use a derivative of DNQ, isobutyl-deoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ) that is more potent and specific in killing TNBC cells than NQO1-activator {beta}-lapachone while displaying strong NQO1-dependence. We evaluated the cellular signaling changes that occur following 4-hour treatment of TNBC cells with either single agent or combination IB-DNQ and / or PARP inhibitor (Rucaparib). Short treatments (4 hours) with IB-DNQ alone or combined with the PARP inhibitor Rucaparib revealed few changes in protein abundance but significant rapid alterations in protein phosphorylation and thermal stability, with clear synergy in the combination treatment. Key phosphorylated targets linked to RNA Polymerase II inhibition and DNA damage response were altered during our short time treatment. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) identified novel, combination-specific changes in protein biophysical state suggesting new therapeutic vulnerabilities in TNBC cells. Our findings highlight how even brief treatments can uncover distinct biophysical protein changes via TPP, offering a resource for mechanistic studies of IB-DNQ mechanism of action and the development of NQO1-activated therapeutics for TNBC treatment.

**Abstract:**
Accumulation of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the hippocampus triggers cognitive memory decline in Alzheimers disease (AD). The incidence and mortality of sporadic AD were tightly associated with diabetes and hyperlipidemia, while the exact linked molecular is uncertain. Here, we reported that serum Kallistatin concentrations were meaningfully higher in AD patients, with a higher concentration of fasting blood glucose and triglyceride. In addition, the constructed Kallistatin-transgenic (KAL-TG) mice defined its cognitive memory impairment phenotype and lower LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons accompanied by increased A{beta} deposition and tau phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Kallistatin could directly bind to the Notch1 receptor and thereby upregulate BACE1 expression by inhibiting PPAR{gamma} signaling, resulting in A{beta} cleavage and production. Besides, Kallistatin could promote the phosphorylation of tau by activating GSK-3{beta}. Fenofibrate, a hypolipidemic drug, could alleviate cognitive memory impairment by down-regulating A{beta} and tau phosphorylation of KAL-TG mice. Collectively, our data clarified a novel mechanism for A{beta} accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation regulation by Kallistatin, which might play a crucial role in linking metabolic syndromes and cognitive memory deterioration, and suggested that fenofibrate might have the potential for treating metabolism-related AD.

**Abstract:**
Spatial biology experiments integrate the molecular and histological landscape of tissues to provide a previously inaccessible view of tissue biology, unlocking the architecture of complex multicellular tissues. Within spatial biology, spatial transcriptomics platforms are among the most advanced, allowing researchers to characterize the expression of thousands of genes across space. These new technologies are transforming our understanding of how cells are organized in space and communicate with each other to determine emergent phenotypes. This is particularly important in cancer research, as tumor evolution is shaped not only by the genetic properties of cancer cells but also by how they interact with the tumor microenvironment and their spatial organization. While many platforms can generate spatial transcriptomics profiles, it is still unclear in which context each platform better suits the needs of its users. Here we compare the results obtained using 5 different spatial transcriptomics (VISIUM, VISIUM CytAssist, VisiumHD, Xenium, and CosMx) and one spatial proteomics (VISIUM CytAssist) platforms across serial sections of 6 FFPE samples from primary human tumors covering some of the most common forms of the disease (lung, breast, colorectal, bladder, lymphoma and ovary). We observed that the VISIUM platform with CytAssist chemistry yielded superior data quality than manual VISIUM. On the other hand, Xenium consistently produced more reliable results for in situ platforms, with better gene clustering and fewer false positives than CosMx. Importantly, these platform-based variations didn't significantly affect cell type identification. VisiumHD offers the best options of both worlds, with subcellular resolution and whole-transcriptome coverage, albeit with some limitations that need to be accounted for in downstream analyses. Finally, by comparing VISIUM protein profiles with the spatial transcriptomics data from all four platforms on each sample, we identified several genes with mismatched RNA and protein expression patterns, highlighting the importance of multi-omics profiling to reveal the true biology of human tumors.

## Surface Wetting Is a Key Determinant of α-Synuclein Condensate Maturation

**Abstract:**
-Synuclein self-assembles into amyloid fibrils during neurodegeneration. The protein can also self-assemble via liquid-liquid phase separation to form biomolecular condensates. The link between these processes is evident, as -synuclein condensates can mature into amyloids. However, the mechanisms driving this maturation remain largely unknown, particularly when incorporating pathological post-translational modifications known to affect -synuclein self-assembly in the absence of LLPS, such as N-terminal truncation. Moreover, condensates are primarily studied as isolated entities; however, it is increasingly evident that they interact with various cellular components and surfaces. Here, we developed a microscopy-based quantitative real-time imaging protocol to investigate how N-terminal truncation influences -synuclein condensate formation, well surface wetting, and maturation. We found that increasing -synuclein truncation, which reduces N-terminal hydrophobicity, inhibits condensate sedimentation, enhances surface wettability, and accelerates maturation. Additionally, by increasing well surface hydrophobicity we decreased -synuclein condensate wettability, delaying their maturation. Thus, we propose that enhanced wettability, which increases the condensate surface-to-volume ratio, promotes -synuclein nucleation at the condensate-bulk solution interface, thereby accelerating maturation. Our results reveal distinct mechanistic roles for -synuclein N-terminal residues and indicate that condensate wetting on cellular surfaces, such as synaptic vesicles, may drive toxic aggregate formation during neurodegeneration.

**Abstract:**
Spatial transcriptomics technologies aim to localize gene expression in tissues and typically use capture surfaces that have undergone spatial indexing or optical decoding to relate surface sequences to spatial positions. Slide-tags is a recently developed method by Russell et al. that inverts this principle, instead diffusing probes from a pre-decoded bead array into tissues, tagging nuclei with spatial bead barcodes. We reanalyzed this data and discovered a latent, spatially informative cell-bead network formed incidentally as a result of barcode diffusion and the biophysical properties of the tissue. By optimizing proximity constraints encoded in the cell-bead network structure, we could infer cell locations without any spatial indexing, placing Slide-tags among a new generation of optics-free, network-based imaging-by-sequencing approaches, a fundamental departure from classical spatial sequencing technologies based on pre-indexed arrays.

**Abstract:**
Animals must balance the urgent need to find food during starvation with the critical necessity to avoid toxic substances to ensure their survival. In Drosophila, specialized Gustatory Receptors (GRs) expressed in Gustatory Receptor Neurons (GRNs) are critical for distinguishing between nutritious and potentially toxic food. GRNs project their axons from taste organs to the Subesophageal Zone (SEZ) in the Central Brain (CB) of Drosophila, where gustatory information is processed. Although the roles of GRs and GRNs are well-documented, the processing of gustatory information in the SEZ remains unclear. To better understand gustatory sensory processing and feeding decision-making, we molecularly characterized the first layer of gustatory interneurons, referred to as Gustatory Second-Order Neurons (G2Ns), which receive direct input from GRNs. Using trans-synaptic tracing with trans-Tango, cell sorting, and bulk RNAseq under fed and starved conditions, we discovered that G2Ns vary based on gustatory input and that their molecular profile changes with the fly's metabolic state. Further data analysis has revealed that a pair of neurons in the SEZ, expressing the neuropeptide Leucokinin (SELK neurons), receive simultaneous input from GRNs sensing bitter (potentially toxic) and sweet (nutritious) information. Additionally, these neurons also receive inputs regarding the starvation levels of the fly. These results highlight a novel mechanism of feeding regulation and metabolic integration.

**Abstract:**
Reading is one of the most complex skills that we utilize daily, and it involves the early development and interaction of various lower-level subskills, including phonological processing and oral language. These subskills recruit brain structures, which begin to develop long before the skill manifests and exhibit rapid development during infancy. However, how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development in these structures support long-term acquisition of literacy subskills and subsequent reading is unclear. Children underwent structural and diffusion MRI scanning at multiple timepoints between infancy and second grade and were tested for literacy subskills in preschool and decoding and word reading in early elementary school. We developed and implemented a reproducible pipeline to generate longitudinal trajectories of early brain development to examine associations between these trajectories and literacy (sub)skills. Furthermore, we examined whether familial risk of reading difficulty and childrens home literacy environments, two common literacy-related covariates, influenced those trajectories. Results showed that individual differences in curve features (e.g., intercepts and slopes) for longitudinal trajectories of volumetric, surface-based, and white matter organization measures were linked directly to phonological processing and indirectly to first-grade decoding and word reading skills via phonological processing. Altogether, these findings suggest that the brain bases of phonological processing, previously identified as the strongest behavioral predictor of reading and decoding skills, may already begin to develop by birth but undergo further refinement between infancy and preschool. The present study underscores the importance of considering academic skill acquisition from the very beginning of life.

Significance StatementReading is crucial for academic, vocational, and health outcomes, but acquiring proficient reading skills is a protracted developmental process involving lower-level subskills and brain structures that undergo rapid development starting in infancy. We examined how longitudinal trajectories of early brain development support long-term acquisition of reading using a reproducible pipeline we developed specifically for infant-to-school-age longitudinal MRI data. Findings suggest that the brain bases of reading-related skills begin to develop by birth but continue building between infancy and preschool. This study emphasizes the importance of considering academic skill acquisition as a dynamic process preceding the emergence of the skill, and it offers a roadmap for future studies to examine relationships between early brain development and academic skill acquisition.

**Abstract:**
Many archaea appear to divide through the coordinated activities of two FtsZ homologues (FtsZ1 and FtsZ2) and another bacterial cell division homologue (SepF), which are part of the midcell division ring. Here, we identify an additional protein (HVO_0739, renamed CdpA) that is involved in cell division in Haloferax volcanii, with homologues in other Haloarchaea. CdpA localizes at the mid-cell division ring, and this requires the presence of the ring-assembly protein FtsZ1. The division constriction protein FtsZ2 also influenced the proper midcell assembly and structure of CdpA. In the absence of CdpA, cells frequently failed to divide properly, and FtsZ1 formed poorly condensed pseudo-helical structures spanning across a broad region of the cell, whereas FtsZ2 showed mispositioned foci, nano-rings, and filaments. The rate of directional movement of FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 structures around the division ring appeared minimally affected by loss of CdpA, which resulted in continual repositioning of the aberrant FtsZ structures in the cells. In contrast to the FtsZ proteins, CdpA formed relatively immobile foci around the ring. Protein domain function studies, pull-down assays, and multimer structure predictions suggest that CdpA is part of a membrane complex that tethers FtsZ2 and other division proteins to the midcell membrane. Our discovery of an archaeal FtsZ organisation and midcell anchor protein offers new insights into cell division mechanisms that are similar across the tree of life.

**Abstract:**
The organization of cell-cell contacts is fundamental for multi-cellular life and operation of organs. Synapses, prototypic contact sites for neuronal communication, are key to brain function and work over the last decades identified multiple synaptic cell adhesion molecules (sCAMs) that drive their organization. Whether these sCAMs operate independently or in coordination through yet unknown linker proteins remained elusive. Here, we used a systematic large-scale multi-epitope affinity-purification approach combined with quantitative mass spectrometry and immuno-EM to comprehensively map trans-synaptic protein networks in the mouse brain. We discover a presynaptic core-module assembled from the two major sCAM families, Neurexins1-3 and LAR-type receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPRD,S,F), and the previously uncharacterized tetraspanin proteins T178A, B. These ternary Neurexin-T178-PTPR complexes form through their transmembrane domains and assemble during biogenesis in the ER. Loss of T178B results in module dissociation, strong reduction of LAR-PTPRs and redistribution of synaptic Neurexins. At synapses, the Neurexin-T178-PTPR module recruits stable and extended trans-synaptic protein networks with defined pre- and post-synaptic partners and secreted extracellular linkers. The network architecture robustly interlinks the distinct functional modules/machineries of the presynaptic active zone and establishes tight associations with XKR-type lipid scramblases and postsynaptic GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors. Our data identify a universal presynaptic core-module for synaptic adhesion and trans-synaptic signaling in the mammalian brain.

**Abstract:**
Cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography provide crucial experimental data for obtaining atomic-detail models of biomacromolecules. Refining these models relies on library-based stereochemical restraints, which, in addition to being limited to known chemical entities, do not include meaningful noncovalent interactions relying solely on nonbonded repulsions. Quantum mechanical (QM) calculations could alleviate these issues but are too expensive for large molecules. We present a novel AI-enabled Quantum Refinement (AQuaRef) based on AIMNet2 neural network potential mimicking QM at substantially lower computational costs. By refining 41 cryo-EM and 30 X-ray structures, we show that this approach yields atomic models with superior geometric quality compared to standard techniques, while maintaining an equal or better fit to experimental data. Notably, AQuaRef aids in determining proton positions, as illustrated in the challenging case of short hydrogen bonds in the parkinsonism-associated human protein DJ-1 and its bacterial homolog YajL.

**Abstract:**
Background: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane-bound receptors that transmit critical signals from extracellular to intracellular spaces. Transcriptomic data of resected breast tumors show that low mRNA expression of orphan GPCR GPR52 correlates with reduced overall survival in patients with breast cancer, leading to the hypothesis that loss of GPR52 supports breast cancer progression. Methods: CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knockout GPR52 in the human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, and in the non-cancerous breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. 2D and 3D in vitro studies, electron microscopy, Matrigel culture, and a zebrafish xenograft model were used to assess the morphology and behavior of GPR52 KO cells. RNA-sequencing and proteomic analyses were also conducted on these cell lines, and transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used to compare GPR52-null and wild-type (WT) signatures in breast cancer. Results: Loss of GPR52 was found to be associated with increased cell-cell interaction in 2D cultures, altered 3D spheroid morphology, and increased propensity to organize and invade collectively in Matrigel. Furthermore, GPR52 loss was associated with features of EMT in MDA-MB-468 cells, and zebrafish injected with GPR52 KO cells developed a greater total cancer area than those injected with control cells. RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses of GPR52-null breast cancer cells revealed an increased cAMP signaling signature. Consistently, we found that treatment of wild-type (WT) cells with forskolin, which stimulates the production of cAMP, induces phenotypic changes associated with GPR52 loss, and inhibition of cAMP production rescued some GPR52 KO phenotypes. Conclusion: GPR52 is an orphan GPCR and its role in cancer progression has not been previously characterized. We found that GPR52 loss in breast cancer cells can lead to increased cell clustering, collective invasion, and EMT in vitro. These are features of increased cancer aggression. Our results reveal that GPR52 loss is a potential mechanism by which breast cancer progression may occur and support the investigation of GPR52 agonism as a therapeutic option for breast cancer.

**Abstract:**
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) occur primarily in the small intestine, lung and pancreas. Due to their rarity compared to other malignancies in these organs, their complex biology remains poorly understood, including their oncogenesis, tumor composition and the intriguing phenomena of mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN). Here we profiled ten low-grade small intestine NET (SiNET) tumor samples as well as one mixed lung tumor by single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq. We find that SiNETs are largely separated into two distinct subtypes, in which the neuroendocrine cells upregulate epithelial or neuronal markers, respectively. Surprisingly, in both subtypes the neuroendocrine cells are largely non-proliferative while higher proliferation is observed in multiple non-malignant cell types. Specifically, B and plasma cells are highly proliferative in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype, potentially reflecting the outcome of high Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) expression in those tumors, which may constitute a relevant target. Finally, our analysis of a mixed lung neuroendocrine tumor identifies a population of putative progenitor cells that may give rise to both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (squamous) cells, potentially explaining the origin of the mixed histology. Taken together, our results provide important insights and hypotheses regarding the biology of neuroendocrine neoplasms.

**Abstract:**
Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced our understanding of meaning representation in the human brain. However, increasingly large LLMs have been questioned as valid cognitive models due to their extensive training data and their ability to access context hundreds of words long. In this study, we investigated whether instruction tuning, another core technique in recent LLMs beyond mere scaling, can enhance models' ability to capture linguistic information in the human brain. We evaluated the self-attention of base and fine-tuned LLMs of different sizes against human eye movement and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity patterns during naturalistic reading. We show that scaling has a greater impact than instruction tuning on model-brain alignment, reinforcing the scaling law in brain encoding performance. These finding have significant implications for understanding the cognitive plausibility of LLMs and their role in studying naturalistic language comprehension.

**Abstract:**
Intravital microscopy (IVM) enables live imaging of animals at single-cell level, offering essential insights into cancer progression. This technique allows for the observation of single-cell behaviors within their natural 3D tissue environments, shedding light on how genetic and microenvironmental changes influence the complex dynamics of tumors. IVM generates highly complex datasets that often exceed the analytical capacity of traditional uni-parametric approaches, which can neglect single-cell heterogeneous in vivo behavior and limit insights into microenvironmental influences on cellular behavior. To overcome these limitations, we present BEHAV3D Tumor Profiler (BEHAV3D-TP), a computational framework that enables unbiased single-cell classification based on a range of morphological and dynamic single cell features. BEHAV3D-TP integrates with widely used 2D and 3D image processing pipelines, enabling researchers without advanced computational expertise to profile cancer and healthy cell dynamics in IVM data. Here, we apply BEHAV3D-TP to study diffuse midline glioma (DMG), a highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by invasive progression. By extending BEHAV3D-TP to incorporate tumor microenvironment (TME) data from IVM or fixed correlative imaging, we demonstrate that distinct migratory behaviors of DMG cells are associated with specific TME components, including tumor-associated macrophages and vasculature. BEHAV3D-TP enhances the accessibility of computational tools for analyzing the complex behaviors of cancer cells and their interactions with the TME in IVM data.

**Abstract:**
Sound encoding depends on the precise and reliable neurotransmission at the afferent synapses between the sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation, as well as interplay between the pre- and postsynaptic components remain largely unclear. Here, we tested the role of the synaptic adhesion molecule and Nogo/RTN4 receptor homolog RTN4RL2 (also referred to as NgR2) in the development and function of afferent IHC-SGN synapses. Upon deletion of RTN4RL2 in mice (RTN4RL2-/-), presynaptic IHC active zones showed enlarged synaptic ribbons and a depolarized shift in the activation of CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels. The postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of SGNs were smaller and deficient of GluA2-4 AMPA receptor subunits despite maintained Gria2 mRNA expression in SGNs. Next to synaptically engaged PSDs we observed "orphan" PSDs located away from IHCs. They likely belong to a subset of SGN peripheral neurites that do not contact the IHCs in RTN4RL2-/- cochleae as found by volume electron microscopy reconstruction of SGN neurites. Auditory brainstem responses of RTN4RL2-/- mice showed increased sound thresholds indicating impaired hearing. Together, these findings suggest that RTN4RL2 contributes to the proper formation and function of auditory afferent synapses and is critical for normal hearing.

**Abstract:**
Yeast Def1 promotes transcription elongation and RNA polymerase II degradation during genotoxic stress. Def1 is cytoplasmic, and DNA damage signals cause its proteolytic processing, liberating its N-terminus to enter the nucleus. Cytoplasmic functions for this abundant protein have not been identified. Proximity-labeling (BioID) experiments indicate that Def1 binds many proteins involved in posttranscriptional control and translation of mRNAs. Deleting DEF1 reduces both mRNA synthesis and decay rates and directly tethering Def1 to a reporter mRNA suppressed expression, suggesting that Def1 directly regulates mRNAs post-transcriptionally. Surprisingly, we found that Def1 interacts with polyribosomes, which requires its N-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain and ubiquitylation of eS7a (Rsp7A) in the small subunit of the ribosome by the Not4 protein in the Ccr4-Not complex. Ribo-seq analysis revealed that deleting DEF1 affected the translation efficiency of a specific subset of transcripts, a genome-wide shift in ribosome footprints on mRNAs and an increase in the dwelling of ribosomes at non-optimal codons. This, together with the high sensitivity of def1{Delta} to translation inhibitors further suggest impaired translation. The polyglutamine-rich unstructured C-terminus of Def1 is required for its interaction with decay and translation factors, suggesting that Def1 acts as a ubiquitin-dependent scaffold to link translation status to mRNA decay. Thus, we have identified a novel function for this transcription and DNA damage response factor in post-transcriptional regulation in the cytoplasm and establish Def1 as a master regulator of gene expression, functioning from transcription to translation.

**Abstract:**
SomaScan and Olink are affinity-based platforms that aim to estimate the relative abundance of thousands of human proteins with a broad range of endogenous concentrations. In this study, we investigated the effects of in vitro hemolysis and repeated freeze-thaw cycles in protein abundance quantification across 10,776 (11K SomaScan) and 1472 (Olink Explore 1536) analytes, respectively. Using SomaScan, we found two distinct groups, each one consisting of 4% of all aptamers, affected by either hemolysis or freeze-thaw cycles. Using Olink, we found 6% of analytes affected by freeze-thaw cycles and nearly half of all measured probes significantly impacted by hemolysis. Moreover, we observed that Olink probes affected by hemolysis target proteins with a larger number of annotated protein-protein interactions. We found that Olink probes affected by hemolysis were significantly associated with the erythrocyte proteome, whereas SomaScan probes were not. Given the extent of the observed nuisance effects, we propose that unbiased, quantitative methods of evaluating hemolysis, such as the hemolysis index successfully implemented in many clinical laboratories, should be adopted in proteomics studies. We provide detailed results for each SomaScan and Olink probe in the form of extensive Supplementary Data files to be used as resources for the growing user communities of both platforms.

**Abstract:**
Social cognition develops through a complex interplay between neural maturation and environmental factors, yet the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Using a naturalistic fMRI paradigm, we investigated the effects of age and parental caregiving on social brain development and Theory of Mind (ToM) in 34 mother-child dyads. The functional maturity of social brain networks was positively associated with age, while mother-child neural synchronization during movie viewing was related to dyadic relationship quality. Crucially, parenting and child factors interactively shaped social cognition outcomes, mediated by ToM abilities. Our findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay of neurocognitive development and interpersonal synchrony in early childhood social cognition, and provide novel evidence for Bandura's theory of social learning and reciprocal determinism. This integrative approach, bridging brain, behavior, and parenting environment, advances our understanding of the complex mechanisms shaping social cognition. The insights gained can inform personalized interventions promoting social competence, emphasizing the critical importance of nurturing parental relationships in facilitating healthy social development.

**Abstract:**
The emerging electron microscopy connectome datasets provides connectivity maps of the brains at single cell resolution, enabling us to estimate various network statistics, such as connectedness. We desire the ability to assess how the functional complexity of these networks depends on these network statistics. To this end, we developed an analysis pipeline and a statistic, XORness, which quantifies the functional complexity of these networks with varying network statistics. We illustrate that actual connectomes have high XORness, as do generated connectomes with the same network statistics, suggesting a normative role for functional complexity in guiding the evolution of connectomes, and providing clues to guide the development of artificial neural networks.

## Bioinformatic discovery of type 11 secretion system (T11SS) cargo across the Proteobacteria

**Abstract:**
Type 11 secretion systems (T11SS) are broadly distributed among proteobacteria, with more than 3,000 T11SS family outer membrane proteins (OMPs) comprising 10 major sequence similarity network (SSN) clusters. Of these, only 7, all from animal-associated cluster 1, have been experimentally verified as secretins of cargo, including adhesins, hemophores, and metal binding proteins. To identify novel cargo of a more diverse set of T11SS, we identified gene families co-occurring in gene neighborhoods with either cluster 1 or marine microbe-associated cluster 3 T11SS OMP genes. We developed bioinformatic controls to ensure perceived co-occurrences are specific to T11SS, and not general to OMPs. We found that both cluster 1 and cluster 3 T11SS OMPs frequently co-occur with single carbon metabolism and nucleotide synthesis pathways, but that only cluster 1 T11SS OMPs had significant co-occurrence with metal and heme pathways, as well as with mobile genetic islands, potentially indicating diversified function of this cluster. Cluster 1 T11SS co-occurrences included 2,556 predicted cargo proteins, unified by the presence of a C-terminal {beta}-barrel domain, which fall into 141 predicted UniRef50 clusters and approximately 10 different architectures: 4 similar to known cargo and 6 uncharacterized types. We experimentally demonstrate T11SS-dependent secretion of an uncharacterized cargo type with homology to Plasmin sensitive protein (Pls). Unexpectedly, genes encoding marine cluster 3 T11SS OMPs only rarely co-occurred with the C-terminal {beta}-barrel domain and instead frequently co-occurred with DUF1194-containing genes. Overall, our results show that with sufficiently large-scale and controlled genomic data, T11SS-dependent cargo proteins can be accurately predicted.

**Abstract:**
Kinetochores link chromosomes to dynamic microtubules of the mitotic spindle. To ensure equal chromosome segregation, sister chromatids must achieve biorientation. The conserved kinase Aurora B phosphorylates outer kinetochore proteins on attachments lacking tension, allowing re-establishment of new connections until biorientation is achieved. Aurora B localizes to the centromere as part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), but the underlying recruitment pathways can be eliminated without disrupting biorientation. It therefore remains unclear how the kinase operates during error correction. Here, we identify the conserved Spc105/Kre28 complex as an outer kinetochore receptor of the Aurora kinase Ipl1 and its activator Sli15 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that mutations in the helix bundle domain of Spc105/Kre28 impair mitotic error correction, resembling the effects of ipl1 or sli15 mutants. The defects can be suppressed by artificial recruitment of Ipl1. In biochemical experiments Ipl1/Sli15 directly associates with Spc105/Kre28, and a conserved segment in the Sli15 central domain is crucially involved in the binding mechanism. These results have important implications for the mechanism of tension-dependent error correction during chromosome biorientation.

Functional MRI (fMRI) using the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal provides valuable insight into grey matter activity. However, uncertainty surrounds the white matter BOLD signal. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) offers an alternative fMRI contrast sensitive to transient cellular deformations during neural activity, facilitating detection of both grey and white matter activity. Further, through minimising vascular contamination, ADC-fMRI has the potential to overcome the limited temporal specificity of the BOLD signal. However, the use of linear diffusion encoding introduces sensitivity to fibre directionality, while averaging over multiple directions comes at great cost to temporal resolution. In this study, we used spherical b-tensor encoding to impart diffusion sensitisation in all directions per shot, providing an ADC-fMRI contrast capable of detecting activity independently of fibre directionality. We provide evidence from two task-based experiments on a clinical scanner that isotropic ADC-fMRI is more temporally specific than BOLD-fMRI, and offers more balanced mapping of grey and white matter activity. We further demonstrate that isotropic ADC-fMRI detects white matter activity independently of fibre direction, while linear ADC-fMRI preferentially detects activity in voxels containing fibres perpendicular to the diffusion encoding direction. Thus, isotropic ADC-fMRI opens avenues for investigation into whole-brain grey and white matter functional connectivity.

**Abstract:**
Kinesin motor proteins facilitate microtubule-based transport by converting chemical energy into mechanic forces, but this activity is autoinhibited until cargo is loaded. Regulatory mechanisms underlying this autoinhibitory conformation are not well understood. Here, we show that a NEver in mitosis Kinase NEKL-3 directly phosphorylates a flexible elbow region between two coiled coil domains connecting the motor head and tail of an intraflagellar transport kinesin, OSM-3. The phosphor dead (PD) mutation, but not phosphor mimic (PM) mutation, induce constitutive motility of OSM-3 in vitro. Using knock-in animals, we discovered that both PD and PM mutations shorten the C. elegans sensory cilia. The constitutively active OSM-3PD fails to enter cilia and abnormally accumulates in neurites, mimicking another hyperactive mutation, OSM-3G444E. Conversely, OSM-3PM enters cilia but moves at a reduced speed, indicating an inhibitory role of elbow phosphorylation in kinesin motility. These findings highlight the crucial role of elbow phosphorylation in regulating kinesin autoinhibition.

**Abstract:**
The Flower protein was suggested to couple the fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs) to their recycling in different model organisms. It is supposed to trigger activity-dependent bulk endocytosis by conducting Ca2+ at endocytic sites. However, this mode of action is debated. Here, we investigated the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog FLWR-1 in neurotransmission. Our results confirm that FLWR-1 facilitates the recycling of SVs at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Ultrastructural analysis of synaptic boutons after hyperstimulation revealed an accumulation of large endocytic structures in flwr1 mutants. These findings do not support a role of FLWR-1 in the formation of bulk endosomes but rather a function in their breakdown. Unexpectedly, loss of FLWR-1 led to increased neuronal Ca2+ levels in axon terminals during stimulation, particularly in GABAergic motor neurons, causing excitation-inhibition imbalance. We found that this increased NMJ transmission might be caused by deregulation of MCA-3, the nematode orthologue of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA). In vivo molecular interactions indicated that FLWR-1 may be a positive regulator of the PMCA and might influence its recycling through modification of plasma membrane levels of PI(4,5)P2.

**Abstract:**
Membrane pore-forming proteins (PFPs) form ring-shaped membrane-translocating oligomers on membranes, contributing to infection, immunity, and cell death functions. Binary toxins produced by some bacteria consist of an enzymatic component that acts as a toxin and a membrane-binding component that forms a pore that delivers the enzymatic component into target cells. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has advanced our understanding of these translocation mechanisms by revealing several binary toxin complexes structures. However, the mechanisms underlying the initial pore formation remain unclear. We determined the structures of several oligomeric forms of the membrane-binding component, Ib, of the Iota toxin from Clostridium perfringens at various stages of pore formation. Structural comparisons revealed that the symmetrically arranged soluble oligomer (prepore) became a transmembrane oligomer (pore). These findings enhance our understanding of the PFP mechanisms and provide a structural basis for developing nanodevices using membrane pores.

**Abstract:**
Biological processes are fundamentally dynamic, yet existing methods for capturing these temporal changes are limited. We present scDynaBar, a novel approach that integrates CRISPR-Cas9 dynamic barcoding with single-cell sequencing to enable the recording of temporal cellular events. In this system, genetic barcodes accumulate mutations over a 25-day period and then are sequenced together with the transcriptome of each single cell. We propose that this gradual accumulation of genetic diversity can be exploited to create an ordered record of a cellular event. We apply this approach to track the transition from a pluripotent state to a two-cell (2C)-like state in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The results provide compelling evidence for the transient nature of the 2C-like state. Additionally, our system shows consistent mutation rates across diverse cell types in a mouse gastruloid model, underscoring its robustness and versatility across various biological contexts. This technique not only improves our ability to study single-cell dynamics but also creates new opportunities for recording other temporal signals, in other words, using dynamic barcoding as a molecular clock in individual cells.

**Abstract:**
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that represent the largest and most therapeutically targeted receptor class, accounting for 30% of currently marketed drugs. Two binding motifs for membrane cholesterol, the cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) domain and the cholesterol consensus motif (CCM), have been postulated. Using a simulation of the molecular dynamics of cholesterol association with the receptor, we predicted the binding of membrane cholesterol to non-canonical sites, distinct from CRAC and CCM, at muscarinic and opioid receptors. We identified a binding site common to muscarinic and opioid receptors at TM6, with arginine 6.35 as the major residue. Membrane cholesterol depletion mimics the effects of R6.35 mutations, confirming its role in receptor modulation. Targeting cholesterol-binding sites offers novel pharmacotherapeutic strategies, including tissue-specific sterol-based modulation.

**Abstract:**
Systemic inflammation can lead to neuroinflammation with acute consequences such as delirium and long-lasting deleterious effects including cognitive decline and the exacerbation of neurodegenerative disease progression. Here we show that transcription factor Nrf2 controls brain endothelial cell homeostasis and barrier strength. We found that peripheral inflammation caused infiltration of macrophages, microglial activation and inflammatory reactive astrogliosis, all of which could be prevented by RTA-404, an activator of the transcription factor Nrf2 and close structural relative of the recently FDA-approved Nrf2 activator RTA-408 (Omaveloxolone). To identify the key cellular mediator(s), we generated an endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 knockout mouse. Strikingly, the effects of RTA-404 on brain endothelial activation and downstream neuroinflammatory events was abolished by endothelial cell-specific Nrf2 deletion. This places endothelial cell Nrf2 as a peripherally accessible therapeutic target to reduce the CNS-adverse consequences of systemic inflammation.

**Abstract:**
As SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge capable of evading neutralizing antibodies, it has become increasingly important to fully understand the breadth and functional profile of T cell responses to determine their impact on the immune surveillance of variant strains. Here, sampling healthy individuals, we profiled the kinetics and polyfunctionality of T cell immunity elicited by mRNA vaccination. Modeling of anti-spike T cell responses against ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that epitope immunodominance and cross-reactivity are major predictive determinants of T cell immunity. To identify immunodominant epitopes across the viral proteome, we generated a comprehensive map of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes within non-spike proteins that induced polyfunctional T cell responses in convalescent patients. We found that immunodominant epitopes mainly resided within regions that were minimally disrupted by mutations in emerging variants. Conservation analysis across historical human coronaviruses combined with in silico alanine scanning mutagenesis of non-spike proteins underscored the functional importance of mutationally-constrained immunodominant regions. Collectively, these findings identify immunodominant T cell epitopes across the mutationally-constrained SARS-CoV-2 proteome, potentially providing immune surveillance against emerging variants, and inform the design of next-generation vaccines targeting antigens throughout SARS-CoV-2 proteome for broader and more durable protection.

**Abstract:**
Plasma membrane rupture and the release of cytosolic contents are hallmarks of necrotic cell death. The plasma membrane protein ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) actively promotes cell lysis by polymerizing into membrane embedded filaments that induce the formation of large plasma membrane lesions. Yet the signals controlling NINJ1 oligomerization and lesion opening remain unknown. Here, we combine cell biology and biophysical measurements to characterize the steps preceding NINJ1-induced PMR. Our results show that NINJ1 lesions form through a 2-step mechanism requiring oligomerization, which is triggered by signal 1, and subsequent lesion opening driven by signal 2, which we determine to be cell swelling without a concomitant increase in intracellular pressure. The close homolog NINJ2 oligomerizes with similar kinetics to NINJ1 but fails to form lesions during cell swelling. NINJ1-NINJ2 chimeras identify that the unstructured N-terminal region of NINJ1 controls lesion opening. In summary, our data establish a 2-step model for NINJ1-driven necrosis.

**Abstract:**
Tandem repeats (TRs) - highly polymorphic, repetitive sequences dispersed across the human genome - are crucial regulators of gene expression and diverse biological processes, but have remained underexplored relative to other classes of genetic variation due to historical challenges in their accurate calling and analysis. Here, we leverage whole genome and single-cell RNA sequencing from over 5.4 million blood-derived cells from 1,925 individuals to explore the impact of variation in over 1.7 million polymorphic TR loci on blood cell type-specific gene expression. We identify over 62,000 single-cell expression quantitative trait TR loci (sc-eTRs), 16.6% of which are specific to one of 28 distinct immune cell types. Further fine-mapping uncovers 4,283 sc-eTRs as candidate causal drivers of gene expression in 13.6% of genes tested genome-wide. We show through colocalization that TRs are likely mediators of genetic associations with immune-mediated and hematological traits in over 700 genes, and further identify novel TRs warranting investigation in rare disease cohorts. TRs are critical, yet long-overlooked, contributors to cell type-specific gene expression, with implications for understanding rare disease pathogenesis and the genetic architecture of complex traits.

**Abstract:**
Structural covariance in brain anatomy is thought to reflect inter-regional sharing of developmental influences - although this hypothesis has proved hard to causally test. Here, we use neuroimaging in humans and mice to study sex-differences in anatomical covariance - asking if regions that have developed shared sex differences in volume also show shared sex differences in volume covariance. This study design illuminates both the biology of sex-differenes and theoretical models for anatomical covariance - benefitting from tests of inter-species convergence. We find that volumetric structural covariance is stronger in adult females compared to adult males for both wild-type mice and healthy human subjects: 98% of all comparisons with statistically significant covariance sex differences in mice are female-biased, while 76% of all such comparisons are female-biased in humans (q < 0.05). In both species, a region's covariance and volumetric sex-biases have weak inverse relationships to each other: volumetrically male-biased regions contain more female-biased covariation (mice: r = -0.185, p = 0.002; humans: r = -0.189, p = 0.001). Our results identify a conserved tendency for females to show stronger neuroanatomical covariance than males, evident across species, which suggests that stronger structural covariance in females could be an evolutionarily conserved feature that is partially related to volumetric alterations through sex.

**Abstract:**
AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCurrent electrophysiological approaches can track the activity of many neurons, yet it is usually unknown which cell-types or brain areas are being recorded without further molecular or histological analysis. Developing accurate and scalable algorithms for identifying the cell-type and brain region of recorded neurons is thus crucial for improving our understanding of neural computation. In this work, we develop a multimodal contrastive learning approach for neural data that can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks, including inference of cell-type and brain location. We utilize this approach to jointly embed the activity autocorrelations and extracellular waveforms of individual neurons. We demonstrate that our embedding approach, Neuronal Embeddings via MultimOdal contrastive learning (NEMO), paired with supervised fine-tuning, achieves state-of-the-art cell-type classification for two opto-tagged datasets and brain region classification for the public International Brain Laboratory Brain-wide Map dataset. Our method represents a promising step towards accurate cell-type and brain region classification from electrophysiological recordings.

**Abstract:**
Mitochondria, the double membrane-bound organelles of endosymbiotic origin, are crucial centers for cellular energy production and several essential metabolic pathways. Recent studies reveal that mitochondria become dysfunctional following numerous cellular stresses, and during pathologies, demanding an extensive investigation of mitochondrial turnover mechanisms. Apart from the specific response pathways to tackle different stresses, mitophagy or degradation of mitochondria by autophagy is a critical quality control mechanism that clears irreversibly damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy is majorly executed either by receptor-mediated or PINK-Parkin-dependent pathways. Here, we show that the human orthologue of yeast Vms1, ANKZF1, participates in PINK-Parkin-mediated mitophagy. We show that ANKZF1 is extensively recruited to damaged mitochondria along with Parkin during mitochondrial proteotoxic stress induced by the expression of a single misfolded/aggregated protein or during uncoupler-induced membrane depolarization. Importantly, ANKZF1 recruitment to damaged mitochondria is significantly enhanced in the presence of Parkin, and ANKZF1 physically interacts with Parkin and LC3 during mitochondrial proteotoxic or depolarization stresses. ANKZF1 harbors six putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs), LIR4 present at residues 333-336 is particularly important for ANKZF1-LC3 interaction. Furthermore, we show that ANKZF1 knockout cells are compromised in clearing stress-damaged mitochondria by mitophagy, indicating an important role of ANKZF1 in mitochondrial turnover during stress. In summary, we show a new role of ANKZF1 in eliminating the stress-damaged mitochondria, reiterating the mito-protective role of Vms1/ANKZF1 during mitochondrial stresses.

## Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate restores TDP-43 pathology-driven genome repair deficiency in motor neuron diseases

**Abstract:**
TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In our recent discovery, we identified that TDP-43 plays an essential role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair via the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. Here, we found persistent DNA damage in the brains of ALS/FTD patients, primarily in the transcribed regions of the genome. We further investigated the underlying mechanism and found that polynucleotide kinase 3-phosphatase (PNKP) activity was severely impaired in the nuclear extracts of both patient brains and TDP-43-depleted cells. PNKP is a key player in DSB repair within the transcribed genome, where its 3-P termini processing activity is crucial for preventing persistent DNA damage and neuronal death. The inactivation of PNKP in ALS/FTD was due to reduced levels of its interacting partner, phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose 2,6 bisphosphatase (PFKFB3), and its biosynthetic product, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), an allosteric modulator of glycolysis. Recent work from our group has shown that F2,6BP acts as a positive modulator of PNKP activity in vivo. Notably, exogenous supplementation with F2,6BP restored PNKP activity in nuclear extracts from ALS/FTD brain samples and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells harboring pathological mutations. Supplementation of F2,6BP also reduced the pathogenic phosphorylation of TDP-43 and cytosolic protein aggregation, both hallmarks of ALS pathology, in patient-derived mutant cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that supplementation of F2,6BP restores genome integrity and partially rescues motor phenotype in a Drosophila model of ALS. Our findings underscore the possibility of exploring the therapeutic potential of F2,6BP or its analogs in TDP-43 pathology-associated motor neuron diseases.

## Astrocytic connexin43 phosphorylation contributes to seizure susceptibility after mild Traumatic Brain Injury

**Abstract:**
Astrocytes play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis through functional gap junctions (GJs) primarily formed by connexin43 (Cx43) in the cortical gray matter. These GJs facilitate electrical and metabolic coupling between astrocytes, allowing the passage of ions, glucose, and metabolites. Dysregulation of Cx43 has been implicated in various pathologies, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired epilepsy. After mild TBI/concussion, we previously identified a subset of atypical astrocytes, which are correlated with the development of spontaneous seizures. These astrocytes exhibit reduced Cx43 expression and coupling. However, atypical astrocytes represent a relatively small subset of astrocytes within the cortical gray matter and previous studies suggest an overall increase of Cx43 protein after TBI. Additionally, Cx43 also has non-junctional and channel-independent functions, which include hemichannel communication with the extracellular milieu, cell adhesion, protein trafficking, protein-protein interactions, and intracellular signaling. In the present study, we set out to determine how mild TBI initiates alterations to Cx43 protein expression and localization, how they may be regulated, and whether they contribute to seizure susceptibility. We demonstrate remarkable heterogeneity of Cx43 protein levels from astrocyte to astrocyte. In accordance with our previous findings, a subset of astrocytes lost Cx43 expression, yet total cortical Cx43 protein increased. At the subcellular level, junctional Cx43 protein levels remained stable, while hemichannels and/or cytoplasmic Cx43 were increased. Phosphorylation of Cx43 at serine 368, a key regulatory site influencing GJ assembly and function, increased after mild TBI. Critically, Cx43S368A mutant mice, lacking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. These findings suggest that TBI-induced Cx43 phosphorylation enhances seizure susceptibility, while inhibiting this modification presents a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure development.

Significance statementConnexin43 (Cx43) is the main protein comprising astrocyte gap junctions which mediate astrocyte coupling into cellular networks, but it also has other non-junctional functions. Many pathologies present with altered Cx43 regulation. In this study, we assessed Cx43 alterations after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a mouse model. We found that while some astrocytes lost Cx43 expression, other astrocytes had increased cytoplasmic and hemichannel Cx43. This increase correlated with an increase in phosphorylated Cx43 at serine 368. Cx43S368A mutant mice, lacking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced susceptibility to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). These findings suggest that TBI-induced Cx43 phosphorylation enhances seizure susceptibility.

**Abstract:**
Protein abundance tends to be more evolutionarily conserved than mRNA levels both within and between species, yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are widespread cis-regulatory elements in eukaryotic genomes that regulate translation, but it remains unclear whether and how uORFs contribute to stabilizing protein levels. In this study, we performed ribosome translation simulations on mRNA to quantitatively assess the extent to which uORF translation influences the translational variability of downstream coding sequences (CDSs) across varying contexts. Our simulations revealed that uORF translation dampens CDS translational variability, with buffering capacity increasing in proportion to uORF efficiency, length, and number. We then compared the translatomes at different developmental stages of two Drosophila species, demonstrating that uORFs buffer mRNA translation fluctuations during both evolution and development. Experimentally, deleting a uORF in the bicoid (bcd) gene-a prominent example of translational buffering-resulted in extensive changes in gene expression and phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster. Additionally, we observed uORF-mediated buffering between primates and within human populations. Together, our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which uORFs stabilize gene translation during development and across evolutionary time.

**Abstract:**
Protein-small molecule interactions, or receptor-ligand interactions, are essential for understanding biological processes and advancing drug design. Despite advancements, existing prediction models of these interactions still lack the capabilities and accuracy needed to replace traditional screening. In this paper, we introduce DockFormer, a method that leverages multi-modal learning to predict both the binding affinity and structure of these interactions. DockFormer employs fully flexible docking, where no part of the receptor remains rigid, by adapting the AlphaFold2 architecture. Instead of relying on protein sequences and Multiple Sequence Alignments, DockFormer uses predicted receptor structures as input. This modification enables the model to concentrate on ligand docking prediction rather than protein folding, while preserving full receptor flexibility. The streamlined design also reduces the model size to just 8 layers, compared to AlphaFold2's 48 layers, greatly accelerating the inference process and making it more efficient for large-scale screening. When evaluated on affinity benchmarks such as CASF-2016, PLINDER, and the recently released CASP16 ligand screening benchmark, DockFormer performs comparably to or better than state-of-the-art methods, which typically rely on templates or bound structures as input. On structural benchmarks such as Posebusters and PLINDER, DockFormer demonstrated success rates of 20% and 15%, respectively.

**Abstract:**
Genetically modified, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising allogeneic source for the generation of functionally enhanced, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. However, the signaling of CARs during early T cell development and the removal of the endogenous T cell receptor required to prevent alloreactivity pose significant challenges to the production of mature conventional CAR T cells from iPSCs. Here, we show that TCR-null, CD8{beta} CAR T cells can be efficiently generated from iPSCs by engineering stage-specific onset of CAR expression and signaling to both permit conventional T cell development and to induce efficient positive selection. CAR T cells produced using this approach displayed a uniform, naive T cell phenotype and demonstrated superior antigen-specific cytotoxicity compared to iPSC-derived effector memory CAR T cells. Multimodal sequencing revealed CAR-mediated positive selection induced the persistent upregulation of key transcription factors involved in naive T cell development. Achieving precise control of CAR expression and signaling in developmentally sensitive T precursors will be critical to realizing the full potential for "off-the-shelf", iPSC-derived cellular therapies.

**Abstract:**
Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) provides high-resolution imaging and morphological information over large fields of view, while Computational Scattered Light Imaging (ComSLI) excels at mapping interwoven fiber organization in unstained tissue sections. This study introduces Fourier Ptychographic Scattered Light Microscopy (FP-SLM), a new multi-modal approach that combines FPM and ComSLI analyses to create both high-resolution phase-contrast images and fiber orientation maps from a single dataset. The method is demonstrated on a state-of-the-art setup that was originally used for FPM and one that was originally used for ComSLI, and the outputs are quantitatively compared to each other on brain sections (frog, monkey) and sections from thigh muscle and knee (mouse). FP-SLM delivers high-resolution images while revealing fiber organization in nerve, muscle, tendon, cartilage, and bone tissues. The approach is validated by comparing the computed fiber orientations with those derived from structure tensor analysis of the high-resolution images. The comparison shows that FPM and ComSLI are compatible with each other and yield fully consistent results. Remarkably, this combination surpasses the sum of its parts, so that applying ComSLI analysis to FPM recordings and vice-versa outperforms both methods alone. FP-SLM can be retrospectively applied to analyze any existing dataset acquired from a setup that was originally built for FPM or ComSLI alone (consisting of LED array and low numerical aperture), without need to build or design an extra setup. This significantly expands the application range of both techniques and enhances the study of complex tissue architectures in biomedical research.

**Abstract:**
Targeting of exocytosis enables cellular morphogenesis, motility and polarized transport, yet relatively little is known about the targeting mechanisms in cellular systems. Here we show that the SEC/MUNC protein KEULE is a dynamic marker for individual secretory events and employ it as a live cell probe, that together with high-precision image analysis of thousands of events, reveal that cortical microtubule arrays act as two-dimensional templates that pattern exocytosis at the nano-scale in higher plant cells. This mechanism is distinct from previously described mechanisms involving motor-driven transport and defines ordered and adjacent linear domains where secretory events are higher and lower than expected, effectively redistributing exocytosis over most of the cell membrane. In addition, analysis of KEULE kinetics revealed distinct phases of assembly/disassembly that are differentially sensitive to experimental treatments that reduce exocytosis, revealing SEC/MUNC dynamics as a versatile and information rich read-out of exocytosis in vivo.

**Abstract:**
Symbiotic systems of photosynthetic microorganisms and fungi are widespread in terrestrial biomes and lichens are probably the most advanced and complex. Conversely, the least complex systems are "green biofilms" with a completely unexplored mycobiome. We describe here a new system intermediate between green biofilms and lichens - semilichens. Light and fluorescence microscopy, eDNA sequencing, molecular phylogeny, Chlorophyll a fluorescence and 13C labelling/metabolomics were used to study algal and fungal identity, morphology and physiology of the symbiosis. Tight contact between algae and a single predominant fungus (mycobiont) is revealed in semilichens. The algae are from the symbiotic lineages of Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae, the fungi belong to Arthoniomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Lecanoromycetes and Lichinomycetes. Algae are alive and perform substantial photosynthetic activity. 13C labelled photosynthates are partially converted into specific fungal polyols (arabitol, mannitol) demonstrating the C-flow from algae to fungi. The new symbiotic system was defined and compared with other terrestrial algal-fungal symbioses. It is characterized by minimalist environmental requirements and extremely low production of biomass. As a result, it also inhabits environments unfavourable for lichens. Our research supports the hypothesis that the long-term existence of algae and fungi in terrestrial conditions affected by frequent and repeated drying is likely dependent on their mutual coexistence.

**Abstract:**
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins crucial to numerous diseases, yet many remain poorly characterized and untargeted by drugs. Chimeric GPCRs have emerged as valuable tools for elucidating GPCR function by facilitating the identification of signaling pathways, resolving structures, and discovering novel ligands of poorly understood GPCRs. Such chimeric GPCRs are obtained by merging a well- and less-well-characterized GPCR at the intracellular limits of their transmembrane regions or intracellular loops, leveraging knowledge transfer from the well-characterized GPCR. However, despite the 212 chimeric GPCRs engineered to date, the design process remains largely trial-and-error and lacks a standardized approach. To address this gap, we introduce GPCRchimeraDB (https://www.bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/), the first comprehensive database dedicated to chimeric GPCRs. It catalogs 212 chimeric receptors, identified through literature review, and includes 1,755 class A natural GPCRs, enabling connections between chimeras and their parent receptors while facilitating the exploration of novel parent combinations. Both chimeric and natural GPCR entries are extensively described at the sequence, structural, and biophysical level through a range of visualization tools, with annotations from resources like UniProt and GPCRdb and predictions from AlphaFold2 and b2btools. Additionally, GPCRchimeraDB offers a GPCR sequence aligner and a feature comparator to investigate differences between natural and chimeric receptors. It also provides design guidelines to support rational chimera engineering. GPCRchimeraDB is therefore a resource to facilitate and optimize the design of new chimeras, so helping to gain insights into poorly characterized receptors and contributing to advances in GPCR therapeutic development.

**Abstract:**
Cytoplasmic inclusions containing TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) are recognized as a major pathological feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Cyclophilin A (PPIA) interacts with TDP-43 and influences its aggregation and function. This interaction is facilitated by PPIA Lys-acetylation. We investigated the effect of lysine deacetylation inhibition to uncover the underlying mechanisms of TDP-43 proteinopathy in relation to PPIA acetylation, and to identify new therapeutic avenues. Through a screening of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in a cellular model of TDP-43 proteinopathy, we identified vorinostat/SAHA, capable of increasing PPIA acetylation, as the most effective in reversing TDP-43 mislocalization. We confirmed its effect in PBMCs from ALS patients and explored its impact on proteinopathy and PPIA acetylation in the Thy1-hTDP-43 mouse model. Thy1-hTDP-43 mice treated with SAHA showed a delayed onset of TDP-43 pathology, associated with PPIA nucleus-cytoplasm redistribution, lower neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, and improved neuromuscular function markers. However, the effect was only temporary. When combined with the heat shock protein (HSP) co-inducer arimoclomol, a mitigation of the neurodegeneration was sustained. A synergistic effect was observed in periphery, greatly enhancing tubulin acetylation and reducing pTDP-43 accumulation in the sciatic nerve and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) {gamma}-subunit expression in gastrocnemius muscle. This study suggests that HDAC inhibition, by increasing acetylated PPIA, could be beneficial in restoring TDP-43 localization and function. The combination of lysine deacetylation inhibition and HSP induction shows a synergistic effect in vivo and has potential as a therapeutic approach for patients.

**Abstract:**
Copious expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is associated with poor survival in many types of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia. We observed that a specific acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) cell line (6133) derived from RBM15-MKL1 knock-in mice exhibited heterogeneity in Prmt1 expression levels. Interestingly, only a subpopulation of 6133 cells expressing high levels of Prmt1 caused leukemia when transplanted into congenic mice. The PRMT1 inhibitor, MS023, effectively cured this PRMT1-driven leukemia. Seahorse analysis revealed that PRMT1 increased the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and decreased the oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Consistently, PRMT1 accelerated glucose consumption and led to the accumulation of lactic acid in the leukemia cells. The metabolomic analysis supported that PRMT1 stimulated the intracellular accumulation of lipids, which was further validated by FACS analysis with BODIPY 493/503. In line with fatty acid accumulation, PRMT1 downregulated the protein level of CPT1A, which is involved in the rate-limiting step of fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, administering the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) delayed AMKL progression and promoted cell differentiation. Ectopic expression of Cpt1a rescued the proliferation of 6133 cells ectopically expressing PRMT1 in the glucose-minus medium. In conclusion, PRMT1 upregulates glycolysis and downregulates fatty acid oxidation to enhance the proliferation capability of AMKL cells.

**Abstract:**
Beta-arrestins are multifunctional regulators of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, orchestrating diverse downstream signaling events and physiological responses across the vast GPCR superfamily. While GPCR pharmacology has advanced to target orthosteric and allosteric sites, as well as G proteins and GRKs, comparable chemical tools to study beta-arrestins remain lacking. Here, we report the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors that selectively target beta-arrestins and delineate their mechanism of action through integrated pharmacological, biochemical, biophysical, and structural analyses. These inhibitors disrupt beta-arrestin-engagement with agonist-activated GPCRs, impairing desensitization, internalization, and beta-arrestin-dependent functions while sparing G protein-receptor coupling. Cryo-EM, MD simulations, and structure-guided mutagenesis reveal that one modulator, Cmpd-5, engages a cryptic pocket formed by the middle, C-, and lariat loops of beta-arrestin1-a critical receptor-binding interface-stabilizing a distinct conformation incompatible with GPCR engagement. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic framework for beta-arrestin modulation, introducing transducer-targeted strategies to fine-tune GPCR signaling and guide the development of pathway-specific therapeutics.

## Structural insights into heterohexameric assembly of epilepsy-related ligand-receptor complex LGI1-ADAM22

**Abstract:**
Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 protein (LGI1) is a secreted neuronal protein consisting of the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and C-terminal epitempin repeat (EPTP) domains. LGI1 is linked to epilepsy, a neurological disorder that can be caused by genetic mutations of genes regulating neuronal excitability (e.g., voltage- or ligand-gated ion channels). ADAM22 is a membrane receptor that binds to LGI1 extracellularly and interacts with AMPA-type glutamate receptors via PSD-95 intracellularly to maintain normal synaptic signal transmission. Structural analysis of the LGI1-ADAM22 complex is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of epileptogenesis and developing new therapies against epilepsy. We previously reported the crystal structure of a 2:2 complex consisting of two molecules of LGI1 and two molecules of the ADAM22 ectodomain (ECD), which is suggested to bridge neurons across the synaptic cleft. On the other hand, multiangle light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and cryo-EM analyses have suggested the existence of a 3:3 complex consisting of three molecules of LGI1 and three molecules of ADAM22. In the previous cryo-EM analysis, many observed particles were in a dissociated state, making it difficult to determine the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the 3:3 complex. In this study, we stabilized the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complex using chemical crosslinking and determined the cryo-EM structures of the LGI1LRR-LGI1EPTP-ADAM22ECD and 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complexes at 2.78 [A] and 3.79 [A] resolutions, respectively. Furthermore, high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) visualized the structural features and flexibility of the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22ECD complex in solution. We discuss new insights into the interaction modes of the LGI1-ADAM22 higher-order complex and the structural properties of the 3:3 LGI1-ADAM22 complex.

**Abstract:**
Structural variation, involving large alterations in chromosome structure, drives genetic diversification and the emergence of new phenotypes. These changes are widespread in natural populations and play an important role in adaptation and speciation. For many species, research has been limited to laboratory adapted strains and experimental evolution, which may not reflect the diversity of structural variants in the wild. Furthermore, technological limitations have proved to be a major barrier to accurate and comprehensive variant calling. In this study, we used PacBio sequencing data from 14 wild Caenorhabditis elegans strains to characterize structural variants in a natural population. With long-reads, we overcame limitations associated with short-read approaches and leveraged population-level data to further refine the accuracy of variant calls. We found that large, rapidly evolving gene families, such as GPCR, F-Box, and C-Type lectin, were prominent among the variants predicted to have phenotypic consequences. These results shed light on the significant role of structural variants in the evolution of Caenorhabditis elegans in its wild habitats and the limitations of treating N2 as the reference wild-type.

**Abstract:**
Aims: To standardise and automate the quantitation of human-unique neuromelanin granules in catecholamine neurons in post-mortem tissue sections from healthy individuals at different ages to understand any changes in these granules with age. Methods: 5-6m thick fixed and paraffin-embedded transverse midbrain tissue sections were supplied from 47 cases from three brain banks following ethics approvals. Sections were prepared and automated digital images acquired. Standardisation and automation of the quantification of neuromelanin granules was performed using the TruAI feature of the Olympus VS200 desktop platform. Comparisons between stained and unstained sections as well as correlations with age were performed. Results: The automated platform reliably identified both stained and unstained intracellular and extracellular neuromelanin granules, showing high reproducibility in measurements across laboratories using different tissue processing methods. Extracellular neuromelanin granules were significantly smaller than intracellular neuromelanin granules. Sections processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining impacted on size and colour of both neuromelanin and the neurons containing neuromelanin. Hematoxylin made neuromelanin bluer and the increased tissue processing made the intracellular area occupied by neuromelanin smaller in younger people. There was an increase in neuromelanin optical density and colour change (more brown) with age. Conclusions: The TruAI automated platform reliably quantifies individual neuromelanin granules in catecholamine neurons. Extracellular neuromelanin is considerably smaller in size than intracellular neuromelanin, and intracellular neuromelanin changes its properties with age. The darkening and colour change of intracellular neuromelanin suggests an increase in eumelanin over time in healthy individuals. These changes can be reliably identified using the automated platform.

## The brain dynamics of congenitally blind people seeing faces and letters via sound

**Abstract:**
Sensory substitution devices (SSDs) convert images to sounds to equip blind individuals with nominally visual functions, like face or letter sensitivity. Prior studies showed that image-to-sound SSDs engage cortices ordinarily specialised for visual functions. However, the brain dynamics of SSD-supported perception remains unknown. Either visual cortices are the first locus of discrimination of SSD percepts, or their activation is a byproduct of perceptual processes unfurling elsewhere, such as in auditory cortices. Resolving this uncertainty is critical for understanding the contribution of visual cortices to mechanisms subserving SSD-induced perceptions in the blind. Using electrical neuroimaging of EEG data from congenitally blind adults, we show for the first time that visual cortices are the earliest site of face and letter sensitivity when conveyed via SSDs, though with distinct temporal dynamics and spatial localizations. In the case of faces versus scrambled faces, differences first manifested at 460ms post-stimulus onset as topographic EEG modulations that were in turn localized to a network of right-hemisphere regions, including the fusiform face area (FFA) as well as lateral occipital cortices. In the case of discerning vertically versus horizontally oriented letter shapes, differences first manifested at 370ms post-stimulus onset as topographic EEG modulations that were localized to a network of left-hemisphere regions, including the occipital pole and the occipito-temporal junction extending into the angular gyrus. Notably, early-latency auditory evoked potentials did not differ based on visual properties of the soundscapes. These collective data support the proposition that responses to soundscapes are routed to brain circuits ordinarily specialized for processing visual information and that these circuits are the loci of the initial discriminant processes. By providing the temporal dynamics of SSD perception, our findings provide unique evidence for the theory that cortices are characterised by task-contingent functional organisation.

**Abstract:**
The nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR) required for cell death (NRC) family represents a group of helper NLRs that are required by sensor NLRs to execute hypersensitive cell death during pathogen infection. NRCs contain an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain essential for their function, yet our knowledge of how this domain contributes to NRC function remains limited. Here, we identified a novel hydrophobic feature within the CC domain that contributes to NRC-mediated immunity. We screened for conserved hydrophobic residues among NRCs and identified seven required for NRC4-mediated cell death. Structural analysis revealed that four of these residues form a hydrophobic core in the CC domain. This hydrophobic core is important for NRC4 subcellular localization, oligomerization, and phospholipid association, but not for NRC4 focal accumulation at the extrahaustorial membrane during Phytophthora infestans infection. Sequence analysis and functional assays revealed this core is highly conserved in NRCs and some singleton NLRs but has degenerated in NRC-dependent sensor NLRs. Our study identifies a novel hydrophobic feature in the CC domain of NRCs and reveals its contribution to NLR-mediated immunity.

**Abstract:**
Macrophages are a highly plastic innate immune cell subset that depends on environmental cues to activate, execute and resolve inflammatory responses. This plasticity of function is mirrored by the diversity of RNA modifications that dynamically decorate macrophage transcripts. Here, using the mouse macrophage line RAW 264.7 (RAW), we addressed the combinatorial effect of two major mRNA modifications: adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) deamination by ADAR1 and adenosine N6-methylation (m6A) by METTL3. Using both short-read and single molecule sequencing on RAW macrophages with genetic deletions of ADAR1 or METTL3, we identified transcripts that were modified by both enzymes, with specific functional outcomes on macrophage activation. While m6A levels remained relatively stable even in the absence of ADAR1, loss of METTL3 led to a global reduction in A-to-I editing levels. This interrelation was most apparent when m6A sites were distant from sites of deamination, suggesting a possible function of m6A in ADAR1-mediated editing. Using a dual reporter cell line where guided ADAR1 recruitment can be measured via eGFP reactivation, we observed that m6A modification of ADAR-engager guide RNAs substantially improved targeted RNA editing. Overall, we report the first example of an interdependence between modifications, which can also be therapeutically exploited.

**Abstract:**
Assessment of pharmacological intervention on in vitro neural systems often emphasizes molecular and structural changes. However, neural systems fundamentally process and act on information. For preclinical assays to predict drug efficacy, they must model these physiological functions. DishBrain, an in vitro synthetic biological intelligence (SBI) assay embodying a neural system in a simulated game-world, enables the quantification of this information-processing capacity, however the question remains whether such a system permits classical pharmacological interrogation and dose-response profiling. Hyperactive glutamatergic dysregulation is linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy, and inducible overexpression of neurogenin 2 (NGN2) in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) generates glutamatergic cultures with dysregulated hyperactivity. We therefore tested three anti-seizure medications (ASMs), phenytoin, perampanel, and carbamazepine, on NGN2 neurons from day 21 of differentiation in this system. The key finding was that, while all compounds altered spontaneous firing, carbamazepine 200 {micro}M significantly improved gameplay metrics. This marks the first demonstration of altered SBI following exogenous drug treatment. Notably, only inhibitory compounds enhanced goal-directed activity, linking glutamatergic attenuation to performance. Neurocomputational analysis revealed nuanced pharmacological responses during closed-loop stimulation, highlighting insights beyond spontaneous activity metrics.

## AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is essential for tendon homeostasis and prevents premature senescence and ectopic calcification

**Abstract:**
Tendinopathy is a debilitating tendon disorder affecting millions of people, characterized by pain, swelling, and diminished biomechanical properties. While the precise mechanisms underlying tendon homeostasis remain unclear, metabolic regulation plays a critical role. In this study, we combine transcriptomic analysis of human tendinopathic samples with a conditional mouse model in which Prkaa1 (encoding AMPK1) is selectively deleted in tendon progenitors to elucidate the role of AMPK signaling in tendon homeostasis. RNA sequencing of diseased human tendons revealed downregulation of key metabolic genes, including several involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and AMPK signaling pathways, alongside an increase in markers associated with senescence and a secretory inflammatory profile. In parallel, mice with loss of Prkaa1 function exhibited normal postnatal development; however, by one month of age, tendons demonstrated widespread transcriptional alterations related to cell cycle regulation and ECM organization. By three months, AMPK1-deficient tendons showed significant reductions in mechanical strength and increased expression of senescence markers p21 and p16, progressing to prominent ectopic calcification with age. In vitro studies further confirmed that tendon fibroblasts lacking AMPK1 have altered ECM substrate adhesion profiles. Importantly, voluntary exercise partially rescued these deficits by enhancing ECM organization and reducing senescence marker expression. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that AMPK1 is critical for maintaining energy balance, regulating ECM remodeling, and preventing premature cellular senescence in tendon. These insights highlight AMPK signaling as a promising therapeutic target and underscore the beneficial role of exercise in mitigating tendinopathic changes.

**Abstract:**
Chronic unhealthy sleeping behaviours are a major risk factor for the emergence of mood and anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, we are still lacking understanding why some individuals are more prone than others to affective dysregulation caused by sleep disruption. With preliminary evidence suggesting that brain activity during positive and negative emotional processing might play an important modulating role, we conducted whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses in a large cohort of healthy young adults (N = 155). Using regions consistently affected in insomnia disorder as seeds, we investigated sleep quality-related neural connectivity patterns that were both insensitive and sensitive to the interactions with individual measures of reward and punishment processing, additionally assessing the links with indices of emotional health. The majority of the findings reflected interactions between sleep quality and reinforcement sensitivity, with the opposite associations reported in the good and poor sleepers. One of such connections, the coupling between precentral gyrus and posterior insula, was additionally negatively linked to trait anxiety, with the lowest connectivity values observed in poor sleepers with higher sensitivity to punishment. In turn, the only finding associated solely with sleep quality, i.e. coupling between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus, was also related to the habitual use of emotion suppression strategies. As such, the present study provides evidence that reinforcement sensitivity plays an essential role in understanding the associations of poor sleep quality with brain connectivity and emotional health, hinting at a potential link that may help explain individual differences in susceptibility to sleep-related affective dysregulation.

**Abstract:**
Somatic structural variations (SVs) are critical genomic alterations in cancer genomes. Long-read sequencing (LRS) is theoretically optimal for detecting somatic SVs. However, influenced by reads-to-reference alignment errors, particularly in low-complexity or highly repetitive genomic intervals, current LRS-based somatic SV callers fail to accurately detect SVs. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive ground-truth datasets hinders accurate evaluation. Here, we introduce SVscope, a novel algorithm that fundamentally addresses these challenges by leveraging full-length sequence information from span-reads and integrating local graph-genome optimization with a random forest strategy. SVscope outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six paired long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) benchmark cell lines, achieving a maximum F1-score improvement of 16.7%. In simulated datasets, SVscope demonstrates superior performance in both somatic SV detection and read phasing tasks. Based on the findings from SVscope, we validated 47 somatic SVs, thereby significantly expanding the existing experimentally validated ground-truth somatic SV dataset by 69.1%.

**Abstract:**
Plasmodium falciparum Pfs230 and Pfs48/45, part of a core fertilization complex, are leading malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates. However, how the two proteins interact is unknown. Here we report a 3.36 [A] resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the endogenous Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex. We show that Pfs48/45 interacts with Pfs230 domains 13 and 14, domains that are not included in current Pfs230 vaccine immunogens. Using a transgenic parasite line with a domain 13 to 14 deletion, we show that these domains are essential for Pfs230 localization on the gamete surface. Furthermore, this line significantly reduced oocyst formation in the mosquito midgut, showing that the presence of Pfs230 domains 13 and 14 is critical for successful fertilization. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibit Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation, reduce transmission and structural analyses reveal their binding epitopes. Furthermore, domains 13 and 14 are targets of naturally acquired immunity and when delivered as mRNA-LNP immunizations induce potent immune responses and blocked transmission of malaria parasites. Our comprehensive structural insights on a core P. falciparum fertilization complex will guide the design of novel transmission-blocking vaccine candidates against malaria.

**Abstract:**
The Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) is the most ubiquitous protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane. This channel facilitates the flux of water-soluble metabolites and ions like calcium across the mitochondrial outer membrane. Beyond this canonical role, VDAC has been implicated, through interactions with protein partners, in several cellular processes such as apoptosis, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. There are three VDAC isoforms in mammalian cells, VDAC 1, 2, and 3, with varying tissue-specific expression profiles. From a biophysical standpoint, all three isoforms can conduct metabolites and ions with similar efficiency. However, isoform knockouts (KOs) in mice lead to distinct phenotypes, which may be due to differences in VDAC isoform interactions with partner proteins. To understand the functional role of each VDAC isoform within a single cell type, we created functional KOs of each isoform in HeLa cells and performed a comparative study of their metabolic activity and proteomics. We found that each isoform KO alters the proteome differently, with VDAC3 KO dramatically downregulating key members of the electron transport chain (ETC) while shifting the mitochondria into a glutamine-dependent state. Importantly, this unexpected dependence of mitochondrial function on the VDAC3 isoform is not compensated by the more ubiquitously expressed VDAC1 and VDAC2 isoforms. In contrast, VDAC2 KO did not affect respiration but upregulated ETC components and decreased key enzymes in the glutamine metabolic pathway. VDAC1 KO specifically reduced glycolytic activity linked to decreased hexokinase localization to mitochondria. These results reveal non-redundant roles of VDAC isoforms in cancer cell metabolic adaptability.

**Abstract:**
Calcineurin is a highly conserved phosphatase that plays a central role in sensing calcium and governing transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational signaling networks. Calcineurin is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic A subunit and a regulatory B subunit. Through downstream effectors, calcineurin signaling drives myriad responses in different organisms. In the fungal pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex that infects humans, calcineurin governs thermotolerance and is essential for growth at high temperature and pathogenesis. In Cryptococcus deneoformans, the underlying molecular functions of this critical signaling cascade are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a genetic screen and identified genetic changes that suppress the requirement for calcineurin during high-temperature growth. Our results identified two mechanisms that bypass the requirement for calcineurin function. The first mechanism involves segmental aneuploidy via both amplification as well as loss of chromosome fragments. The second mechanism involves dominant amino acid substitution mutations in the genes encoding three proteins, Chs6, Imp2, and Cts1, orthologs of components of the Ingression Progression Complex required for septation and budding in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Loss of calcineurin activity causes chitin and chitosan accumulation and severe budding defects, whereas suppressor mutations largely restore growth and cytokinesis in the absence of calcineurin. These findings reveal the calcineurin signaling cascade controls a conserved cytokinesis machinery at the mitotic exit network during thermal stress.

**Abstract:**
As we listen to speech, our brains actively compute the meaning of individual words. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we hypothesized that the brain employs vectorial coding principles, such that meaning is reflected in distributed activity of single neurons. We recorded responses of hundreds of neurons in the human hippocampus, which has a well-established role in semantic coding, while participants listened to narrative speech. We find encoding of contextual word meaning in the simultaneous activity of neurons whose individual selectivities span multiple unrelated semantic categories. Like embedding vectors in semantic models, distance between neural population responses correlates with semantic distance; however, this effect was only observed in contextual embedding models (like BERT) and was reversed in non-contextual embedding models (like Word2Vec), suggesting that the semantic distance effect depends critically on contextualization. Moreover, for the subset of highly semantically similar words, even contextual embedders showed an inverse correlation between semantic and neural distances; we attribute this pattern to the noise-mitigating benefits of contrastive coding. Finally, in further support for the critical role of context, we find that range of neural responses covaries with lexical polysemy. Ultimately, these results support the hypothesis that semantic coding in the hippocampus follows vectorial principles.

**Abstract:**
Hyperreflexia is a consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI) and motor system lesions in the brain Two major mechanisms underpinning hyperreflexia have been reported: proprioceptive afferent (PA) circuit changes produced by 1A fiber sprouting, which could enhance reflex signaling, together with reduced GABAergic inhibitory presynaptic regulation (GABApre); and increased intrinsic motor neuron excitability, for example, produced by reduced motor neuron membrane-bound potassium-chloride co-transporter2 (KCC2). Here we examine how selective unilateral CST injury in the medullary pyramid (PTX), which eliminates the CST from one hemisphere, allows for specific investigation of the different mechanisms to determine their contributions to hyperreflexia. We used rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the Hoffmann (H)-reflex for the forelimb and hindlimb 5th-digit abductor muscles to assess hyperreflexia on both the contra-and ipsilesional sides. We compared RDD in naive and unilateral-PTX rats at 7-dpi and 42-dpi, supplemented with additional timepoints to examine hyperreflexia development.

Immunohistochemistry was used to identify PA synapses (VGlut1), GABA presynaptic boutons (GABApre), motor neurons (ChAT), and to measure KCC2. Following unilateral PTX, we observed significant hyperreflexia in the contralesional forelimb only. Membrane-bound KCC2 was unchanged in contralesional cervical motor neurons. Whereas both cervical and lumbar motor neurons showed increased PA sprouting contralesionally, there was a concomitant increase in GABApre terminals for the lumbar not cervical cord, which associated with a normal hindlimb H-reflex. Our findings show that KCC2 is disassociated from hyperreflexia in the uniPTX model. Instead, forelimb hyperreflexia can be explained by cervical motor neuron PA sprouting and an uncompensated GABApre regulation.

**Abstract:**
Fluorescent imaging enables visualization of the specific molecules of interest with high contrast, and the use of multiple fluorophores in a single tissue sample allows visualization of complex relationships between biological molecules, cell types, and anatomy. The utility of fluorescent imaging in human tissue has been limited by endogenous pigments that can block the light path or emit an autofluorescence, thereby interfering with the specific imaging of target molecules. Although photobleachers have been developed to quench endogenous pigments, the lack of customizability limits their utility for a broad range of applications. Here, we present a high luminous-intensity photobleacher that is based on rigorous simulations of illumination patterns using the laws of radiation, along with the framework to maximize bleaching efficiency. This open-source project is designed to help researchers customize and scale according to the tissue types and the research goals. The photobleacher is applicable to both thin tissue slices and large-volume cleared tissue samples to enable serial three-dimensional imaging of postmortem human brain using multiplexed antibody or oligonucleotide probes.

**Abstract:**
We present the first causal evidence in the healthy human brain linking the central thalamus to vigilance and the pulvinar to visuospatial attention using low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS). In a within-subjects, counterbalanced design, 27 healthy volunteers completed the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), a vigilance task, and the Egly-Driver Task (EDT), which assesses visuospatial attention, before and after central thalamus, pulvinar, and sham sonication with tFUS. Central thalamic sonication significantly impaired performance on both tasks in a manner consistent with decreases in arousal. Targeting the pulvinar with tFUS resulted in more subtle changes in visuospatial attention. Participants were less reactive to visual stimuli presented in the visual field contralateral to the affected pulvinar. These results demonstrate that tFUS can elicit measurable behavioral changes in healthy volunteers and underscores its potential as a high-resolution tool for non-invasive brain mapping, capable of differentiating functional contributions of thalamic regions only millimeters apart.

**Abstract:**
Intratumor transcriptional heterogeneity (ITTH) presents a major challenge in cancer treatment, particularly due to limited understanding of the diverse malignant cell populations and their relationship to therapy resistance. While single-cell sequencing has provided valuable insights into tumor composition, its high cost and technical complexity limits its use for large-scale tumor screening. In contrast, several databases collecting bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from multiple samples across various cancer types are available and could be used to profile ITTH. Several deconvolution approaches have been developed to infer cellular composition from such data. However, most of these methods rely on predefined markers or single cell reference datasets, limiting the performance of such methods by the quality of used reference data. Although unsupervised approaches do not face such limitations, existing methods have not been specifically adapted to characterize malignant cell states, and focus instead on general cell types. To address these gaps, we introduce CDState, an unsupervised method for inferring malignant cell subpopulations from bulk RNA-seq data. CDState utilizes a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization model improved with sum-to-one constraints and a cosine similarity-based optimization to deconvolve bulk gene expression into distinct cell state-specific profiles, and estimate the abundance of each state across tumor samples. We validate CDState using bulkified single-cell RNA-seq data from five cancer types, showing that it outperforms existing unsupervised deconvolution methods in both cell state proportions and gene expression estimation. Applying CDState to 33 cancer types from TCGA, we identified recurrent malignant cell programs, with epithelial-mesenchymal transition as the main driver of tumor transcriptional heterogeneity. We further link the identified malignant states to patient clinical features, revealing states associated with worse patient prognosis. We show that ITTH is linked with patient survival and clinical features, as well as is associated with varied responses to therapy. Finally, we identified potential genetic drivers of ITTH and malignant cell states, including TP53, KRAS, and PIK3CA, known oncogenic genes.

**Abstract:**
Deep learning methods have been developed to predict gene expression levels across various cell and tissue types based on DNA-binding sites of protein identified by ChIP-seq. However, the experimental identification of DNA/RNA-binding sites and the functional characterization of certain proteins remain challenging. Here I predicted the regulatory target genes and functional roles of DNA/RNA-binding proteins using gene co-expression data. Gene co-expression correlations are derived from gene expression profiles across cells and tissues and represent interactions between a DNA/RNA-binding protein and other genes. I used these interactions to predict gene expression levels by partially replacing the input data in the deep learning analysis. Functional annotations statistically overrepresented in the predicted target genes of ten DNA/RNA-binding proteins examined in this study were consistent with their known biological roles. Furthermore, several annotations not present in current gene function databases were supported by findings in previously published studies.

**Abstract:**
Tinnitus, the perception of sound without an external source, affects a significant portion of the population, yet its impact on brain communication diagram known as the functional connectome, remains limited. Traditional functional connectivity (FC) methods, such as Pearson correlation, phase lag index and coherence rely on pairwise comparisons and are therefore limited in providing a holistic encoding of FC. Here, we employ an alternative approach to estimate the entire connectivity structure by analyzing all time-courses simultaneously. This approach is robust even for short-duration recordings, facilitating faster functional connectome identification and real-time applications. Using resting-state MEG recordings from controls and individuals with tinnitus, we demonstrated that the learned connectomes outperform correlation-based connectomes in fingerprinting, that is, identifying an individual from test-retest acquisitions. Group-level analysis revealed distinct altered FC in tinnitus across multiple frequency bands, affecting the default mode, auditory, visual, and salience networks, suggesting a reorganization of these large-scale networks beyond auditory areas. Our study reveals that tinnitus presents highly individualized and heterogeneous whole-brain connectome profiles, highlighting the need to focus on individual variability rather than group-level differences to gain a more nuanced understanding of tinnitus. Personalized FC could enable patient-specific tinnitus models, optimizing treatment strategies for individualized care.

**Abstract:**
Influenza continues to pose significant global health threats, hijacking host cellular machinery through protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are fundamental to viral entry, replication, immune evasion, and transmission. Yet, our understanding of these host-virus PPIs remains incomplete due to the vast diversity of viral proteins, their rapid mutation rates, and the limited availability of experimentally validated interaction data. Additionally, existing computational methods often struggle due to the limited availability of high-quality samples and their inability to effectively model the complex nature of host-virus interactions. To address these challenges, we present SEHI-PPI, an end-to-end framework for human-influenza PPI prediction. SEHI-PPI integrates a double-view deep learning architecture that captures both global and local sequence features, coupled with a novel adaptive negative sampling strategy to generate reliable and high-quality negative samples. Our method outperforms multiple benchmarks, including state-of-the-art large language models, achieving a superior performance in sensitivity (0.986) and AUROC (0.987). Notably, in a stringent test involving entirely unseen human and influenza protein families, SEHI-PPI maintains strong performance with an AUROC of 0.837. The model also demonstrates high generalizability across other human-virus PPI datasets, with an average sensitivity of 0.929 and AUROC of 0.928. Furthermore, AlphaFold3-guided case studies reveal that viral proteins predicted to target the same human protein cluster together structurally and functionally, underscoring the biological relevance of our predictions. These discoveries demonstrate the reliability of our SEHI-PPI framework in uncovering biologically meaningful host-virus interactions and potential therapeutic targets.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
Infectious diseases, also known as communicable disease or transmissible disease is illness that is caused due to pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. One of such infection is caused by zoonotic virus (bat-borne) known as Nipah virus (NiV). NiV is one of the worlds deadliest viruses leading to highest mortality rates. It is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to category C priority pathogen that belongs to genus Hepanivirus, and family Paramyxoviridae. The first occurrence of NiV was observed in Malaysia-Singapore during 1998-1999 and the most recent outbreak in Kozhikode district of Kerala in 2018.

Currently, no drugs or vaccines specific to NiV have proven to yield effective outcome at advanced stage of the disease. However, some therapies involving antiviral drug like Ribavirin along with other medicines have shown to recover patients, reducing the death rate by 36%. Due to extensive research various therapeutic strategies have been proven to successfully target the viral infection during the early stages in animal models. Several vaccines have been under investigation and clinical trials serving as a promising approach towards effective and safe vaccine in both livestock animals and humans.

This study underscores the essential contributions shaping the academic discourse in nipah virus research, bringing to light the most influential studies within the co-citation and co-occurrence network analysis. By identifying the keywords, we gain valuable insights into the foundational research driving advancements in this research area. The detailed mapping of the co-citation network further illuminates the interconnectedness of various research themes and the collaborative efforts that boost the field of nipah virus research in different horizons. The recognition of influential studies not only highlights the depth and breadth of scholarly engagement but also provides a roadmap for future research endeavours.

**Abstract:**
The growing interconnection between human, animal, and environmental health has escalated the need for integrated approaches to public health. The One Health framework addresses this necessity by promoting local, national, and global interdisciplinary collaboration. Population growth, intensive animal farming, and manmade environmental changes contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases of probable animal origin, such as COVID-19. Establishing the Quadripartite collaboration with four multilateral United Nations agencies underscores the increasing recognition of these interdependencies. This scoping review protocol aims to evaluate how One Health studies integrate human, animal, and environmental health, analyzing methodologies, scope, and interdisciplinary collaboration, to identify key achievements, existing gaps, and future research priorities. The projected literature search will include PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Virtual Health Library, Health Systems Evidence, and Social Systems Evidence. Additionally, grey literature will be retrieved from Opengrey, Thesis Commons, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations, by structured electronic search, as well as the first 100 entries in Google Scholar, manually. This protocol proposes to include studies, policies, regulations, strategies, and interventions published from 2004 onwards aimed at the prevention and integrated management of food safety, zoonotic diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and the impacts of climate change on health. No language filters will be applied. Two independent reviewers will analyze titles, abstracts, and full texts to conduct a two-phase review, with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. Data will be retrieved using a standardized data extraction form, and results will be presented in graphic and tabular format, accompanied by a narrative summary, to highlight the achievements of integrated One Health implementation. The expected result is the development of a scoping review protocol to map One Health studies and practices, which effectively integrate the human, animal, and environmental health dimensions applicable globally in public health scenarios.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

**Abstract:**
Despite intensive study, gaps remain in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to limited contextual metadata accompanying most large genomic surveillance datasets. We analyzed over 130,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, over 85,000 with matched epidemiological data, collected in Massachusetts from November 2021 to January 2023, to investigate viral transmission dynamics at high resolution. The data were drawn from diagnostic testing at >600 facilities representing schools, workplaces, public testing, and other sectors, and encompass the emergence of six major viral lineages, each representing a new outbreak. We found urban areas as key hubs for new lineage introduction and interurban transmission as facilitating spread throughout the state. Young adults, especially those on college campuses, served as early indicators of emerging lineage dominance. Resident-aged populations in college campuses and nursing homes exhibited a higher likelihood of being linked to within-facility transmission, while staff-aged at those facilities were more linked to their surrounding community. Individuals with recent vaccine doses, including boosters, had a lower likelihood of initiating transmission. This dataset shows the value of linking genomic and epidemiologic data at scale for higher resolution insights into viral dynamics and their implication for public health strategy.

**Matched Keywords:** public health

**Abstract:**
IntroductionPneumonia is a leading cause of under-five mortality, with 30 million annual cases in India. Despite national guidelines, significant barriers to timely and appropriate care-seeking persist. Caregivers often face financial constraints, lack of awareness, mistrust in government facilities, and a preference for non-registered medical practitioners (non-RMP), delaying effective treatment. This study explores care-seeking behaviors, associated sociodemographic factors, and barriers to access to appropriate healthcare for childhood pneumonia in rural India.

MethodsThis study is part of a broader implementation research (IR) initiative and represents its formative phase. This mixed-methods study was conducted in Palwal district, Haryana, covering 42 villages (population: 107,440). A cross-sectional survey identified suspected pneumonia cases among 9,593 under-five children through house-to-house visits using a structured checklist. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, health insurance, care-seeking patterns, and provider preferences were collected. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) identified potential confounders in the association between care-seeking behaviour and key exposure variables. Additionally, qualitative in-depth interviews explored caregivers perceptions, decision-making, and healthcare barriers to pneumonia management. Quantitative data were analysed using logistic regression, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed using the Three Delays Model. Suspected under-five pneumonia cases caregivers and families were actively engaged in this formative phase to inform Phase II implementation strategies of broader IR, ensuring community-driven and contextually relevant strategies.

ResultsAmong 231 suspected pneumonia cases, 97% of caregivers sought medical care, but 71% consulted non-RMPs, and only 3.6% visited government facilities. Seeking appropriate care was associated with higher maternal education (AOR 6.5, 95% CI: 2.7, 9.7) and higher wealth index (AOR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.6). Thematic analysis revealed delays due to symptom misinterpretation, reliance on home remedies, financial constraints, gender biases, mistrust in public healthcare services, and logistical barriers.

ConclusionDespite high care-seeking rates, provider preferences, socio-cultural factors, and systemic barriers delay appropriate pneumonia treatment. Addressing these challenges requires improving awareness, enhancing public healthcare trust, and strengthening frontline health worker engagement. This study underscores the role of structured beneficiary involvement in refining pneumonia management strategies to ensure sustainable, community-driven interventions.

**Abstract:**
Psychedelics have garnered great attention in recent years as treatments for major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression due to their ability to alter consciousness and afflicted cognitive processes with lasting effects. Given these unique characteristics and the urgent need for efficacious treatments, psychedelics are being tested for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite promising results and growing interest, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics remain uncharacterized. Using a scoping review approach, we summarize current clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov that utilize classic psychedelics as interventions for SUDs with the goal of understanding the current state and outlook of the field. A second scoping review was conducted using PubMed and SCOPUS databases to identify the relevant publications addressing the pharmacotherapeutic potential of restoring dopamine homeostasis as a novel neurobiological mechanism of psychedelics. This mechanism may blunt drug-seeking behavior, promote drug abstinence, and underlie their clinical relevance for SUD in addition to previously characterized mechanisms.

**Abstract:**
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes significant morbidity, mortality, and growthth faltering among children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. While gut inflammation contributes to growth faltering, the role of ETEC in inflammation remains poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that ETEC-producing heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxins (ST) induced significant inflammation in humans, but LT-only strains are understudied. In this study, we evaluated the intestinal inflammation induced by the LT-only ETEC strain LSN03-016011/A in a human challenge model. Stool samples were analyzed for pre- and post-challenge myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines, ETEC shedding, and ETEC-specific antibody responses. MPO, IL-1{beta}, and IL-8 levels significantly increased post-ETEC challenge, but there was no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Participants protected from severe diarrhea had higher levels of pre-challenge IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-{gamma} compared to those not protected. The MPO and specific cytokine levels were significantly correlated with the seroconversion status to LT and the colonization factor antigen CS17. This study provides evidence that LT-ETEC strain can induce significant intestinal inflammation even in the absence of symptoms, highlighting the need for a vaccine and a better understanding of the impact of ETEC-attributable inflammation on child health in endemic areas.

Author summaryEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of enteric infections, resulting in diarrhea, malnutrition, and other long-term health effects. However, how ETEC - particularly strains that produce only the heat-labile toxin (LT) - can contribute to gut inflammation is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the impact of an LT-ETEC infection on gut inflammation and its relations to ETEC-specific immune responses using samples from participants in a controlled human infection study. We found that LT-ETEC induces a significant level of gut inflammation marker myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1{beta}, when the patients had moderate to severe diarrhea and even when diarrheal symptoms were mild or absent. Gut inflammation level correlated with immune responses to ETEC. These findings suggest that LT-ETEC infection causes significant gut inflammation, which plays a role in immune responses. Our results highlight the need for preventive strategies to reduce the burden of ETEC-related illness, particularly in regions where these infections are common, to prevent broader adverse consequences for gut health and child development.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundThe World Health Organization recommends perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), generally using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to children at high risk of severe P. falciparum malaria. Currently, PMC is given up to age two in perennial transmission settings. However, no recommendation exists for perennial settings with seasonal variation in transmission intensity, recently categorized as  sub-perennial. Tailored chemoprevention strategies are needed to protect children during seasons and ages of highest malaria risk. The seasonal dimension must adequately cover seasonally increased risk periods, alongside interventions that address year-round, lower intensity transmission. We propose a hybrid malaria chemoprevention (HMC) strategy, integrating two delivery components: 1) existing PMC, and 2) additional monthly SP doses during the higher-risk rainy season, ensuring a one-month gap between any two doses.

MethodsUsing a validated individual-based malaria model combined with pharmacological models of drug action (OpenMalaria), we examined the potential public health impact of the proposed HMC (for children 03-24 months), and an age-expanded HMC (referred to as HMC+, for children 03-36 months), under different drug sensitivity, coverage, and prevalence (5-70%) assumptions.

ResultsHMC and HMC+ demonstrated a median (interquartile range) of 2.1 (1.6-2.6), 2.9 (2.2-3.6) times higher efficacy (relative fold increase in burden averted) compared to only PMC against clinical, and 2.0 (0.6-3.4), 3.3 (0.8-5.8) against severe cases, respectively, in children under age three. This led to a median protective efficacy of 31.8% (25.4-38.2%), 44.9% (36.9-52.9%) against clinical, and 16.1% (7.0-25.2%), 26.4% (14.4-38.4%) against severe cases by HMC and HMC+ respectively, across the prevalence, drug sensitivity, and coverage assumptions. We found positive net impact for children under age five years, outweighing a limited potential of delayed malaria across settings.

ConclusionSubstantially increased public health benefits might be achieved by adding seasonally-targeted chemoprevention to current PMC in sub-perennial malaria transmission settings. Effectiveness-implementation studies should generate empirical evidence of public health impact including on the disease burden averted, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the hybrid approach. Such studies should also explore determinants of implementation success including operational feasibility, and acceptability of proposed dosing strategies which will facilitate deployment decisions.

**Abstract:**
Similarities between mental symptoms in Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and those in Post-COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PCVS) have been observed. Based on a representative survey of the population aged 18 to 69 years in Germany (n = 4,628), the epidemiologies of both PCS and PCVS were studied. Mental symptoms of PCS (fatigue/exhaustion/weakness, reduced performance, concentration and memory problems, sleep disorders and depressed mood) were reported by 12.1% and mental symptoms of PCVS were reported by 12.6% of all respondents. Concerning PCS, mental symptoms were reported more often by females compared to males (13.5% versus 10.7%), whereas no gender differences were found for PCVS. With the increasing number of booster vaccinations, mental PCVS decreased from 20.8% with one vaccination to 8.9% with four or more vaccinations. Overall, non-mRNA vaccines did not lead significantly to more mental symptoms than mRNA vaccines (12.9% versus 12.5%) but did differ concerning mental symptom patterns: concentration and memory problems (8.2% versus 3.3%), impaired performance (5.7% versus 4.2%) and sleep disorders (6.6% versus 3.2%) were reported more frequently in non-mRNA vaccines. The reported rate of mental PCVS being 12.6% is clearly higher than the 0.5% recorded by official documentation systems (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI)), suggesting a major underreporting. The data indicate that mental symptoms occurring in both PCS and PCVS are common, making the differential diagnosis between PCS and PCVS, as well as between both PCS and PCVS and independent mental disorders such as depressive disorders, an important but challenging task.

**Abstract:**
Background We aimed to estimate the burden of antibiotic-nonsusceptible non-bacteremic pneumonia and sinusitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in US adults ([&ge;]18 years). Methods We estimated antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococcal sinusitis and non-bacteremic pneumonia incidence as products of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates, serotype distribution, and serotype-specific antimicrobial nonsusceptibility prevalences by antibiotic class and guideline-recommended agents from 2016-2019. We derived pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates from national healthcare utilization surveys and administrative datasets; pneumococcal-attributable attributable percents and serotype distributions from published data; and serotype-specific nonsusceptibility estimates from Active Bacterial Core surveillance data. We evaluated nonsusceptibility for all serotypes and those targeted by 15-, 20- and 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15/20/21). Results An estimated 16.4% (95% confidence interval 12.8-21.4%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 19.0% (14.8-24.9%) of sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes, translating to 243,521 (179,673-333,675) and 1,844,726 (1,070,763-2,904,089) outpatient visits for pneumonia and sinusitis, respectively, and 10,155 (7,542-13,803) pneumonia hospitalizations annually. An estimated 31.2% (26.6-36.3%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 10.5% (9.4-12.0%) of pneumococcal sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]1 outpatient first-line antibiotic agent. Cases attributable to serotypes targeted by PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21 that were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes accounted for 7.4% (4.7-11.1%), 8.5% (5.8-12.1%), and 12.6% (9.2-17.5%) of all non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia cases, and 8.4% (5.3-12.5%), 9.4% (6.2-13.4), and 14.4% (10.4-20.0%) of all pneumococcal sinusitis cases. Conclusions We demonstrated high proportions of antibiotic nonsusceptibility in non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis in US adults. PCVs and antibiotic stewardship may mitigate antibiotic nonsusceptibility in pneumococcal disease.

**Abstract:**
Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a promising non-invasive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), though significant variability exists in patient responses. This quadruple-blind, sham-controlled crossover randomized clinical trial investigated whether clinical improvement was influenced by the spatial selection of stimulation sites or early cardiac rhythm modulations. Seventy-five MDD patients (33 women) were randomized to either personalized stimulation sites, identified via the strongest negative functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the default mode network (DMN), or fixed stimulation at the F3 position of the 10-20 EEG system. Electrocardiograms throughout stimulation monitored heart rate and its variability, focusing on heartbeat deceleration (RR slope) and changes in the root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats (RMSSD). Findings demonstrated that a higher RR slope within the first 45 seconds of stimulation predicted greater clinical improvement at six weeks, while a lower RMSSD change during the first 270 seconds correlated with improvement at one week. However, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between personalized and fixed stimulation sites. This study identified a significant relationship between early heart rhythm modulations and the antidepressant effects of accelerated iTBS in MDD. Although the spatial determination of stimulation sites did not enhance clinical improvement, iTBS-induced changes in cardiac rhythm during early sessions may develop into valuable biomarkers for stratifying patients, enabling more personalized and effective treatment strategies in the future.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: University students frequently experience challenges that affect their sleep quality, including academic stress, lifestyle habits, and socio-demographic factors. Common sleep disturbances, such as delayed sleep onset and poor sleep efficiency, often result in daytime dysfunction and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm. Methods: This cross-sectional study appraised sleep quality among undergraduate students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 530 undergraduate students were purposively selected from three public universities. Participants were chosen through convenience sampling, with students who had contracted COVID-19 during the study excluded from the sample. Results: The mean age of the university students was 21.1 (2.0) years. Regarding PSQI components, the participants showed moderate sleep latency (55.7%) and habitual sleep efficiency (56.0%), with mild levels of sleep disturbances at night (68.1%), daytime dysfunction (51.1%), and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm (48.5%). The global PSQI scores were poor for 59.4% of participants, while 40.6% had good scores, with a mean of 6.5(2.9). Among the students, 44.9% reported fair subjective sleep quality, followed by good (24.7%), very good (18.1%), and poor (12.3%) sleep quality. Lifestyle factors such as class attendance, online media usage, BMI, physical exercise, tea/coffee consumption, and smoking were significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Sleep quality factors like daytime sleep duration, nighttime sleep latency, and sleeping pill usage were also significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Significant associations were found between sleep quality and factors such as age, household income, daily study hours, BMI, daytime sleep, and sleep latency (p<0.05). Conclusion: The study revealed that longer sleep latency, daytime sleep, and sleeping pill usage were related with poorer sleep quality. It also emphasized that sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm were significant predictors of sleep quality.

**Abstract:**
In 2024, the Americas region experienced the largest dengue outbreak on record and Brazil was among the worst affected countries, reporting 6.6 million cases and 6,200 deaths. We report the long-term entomological and epidemiological effectiveness of city-wide deployment of wMel-strain Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti in Niteroi, a city of half a million people in Rio de Janeiro state, where Wolbachia releases across 70% of the urban population in 2017-2019 were expanded to remaining populated areas in 2023. wMel was durably established at [&ge;]95% prevalence in Ae. aegypti populations throughout Niteroi four years post-release, and up to seven years in the earliest release sites. This city-wide Wolbachia coverage provided sustained population-level protection against dengue throughout the five years post-intervention, including during the 2024 epidemic surge, averting an estimated three-quarters of the dengue case burden that would otherwise have been expected in Niteroi in 2024.

**Abstract:**
Background: Patients with rare cancers face substantial challenges due to limited evidence-based treatment options, resulting from sparse clinical trials. Advances in large language models (LLMs) and recommendation algorithms offer new opportunities to utilize all clinical trial information to improve clinical decisions. Methods: We used LLM to systematically extract and standardize more than 100,000 cancer trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Each trial was annotated using a customized scoring system reflecting cancer-treatment interactions based on clinical outcomes and trial attributes. Using this structured data set, we implemented three state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend potentially effective treatments across different cancer types. Results: The LLM-driven data extraction process successfully generated a comprehensive and rigorously curated database from fragmented clinical trial information, covering 78 cancer types and 5,315 distinct interventions. Recommendation models demonstrated high predictive accuracy (cross-validated RMSE: {0.49--0.62}) and identified clinically meaningful new treatments for melanoma, independently validated by oncology experts. Conclusions: Our study establishes a proof of concept demonstrating that the combination of LLMs with sophisticated recommendation algorithms can systematically identify novel and clinically plausible cancer treatments. This integrated approach may accelerate the identification of effective therapies for rare cancers, ultimately improving patient outcomes by generating evidence-based treatment recommendations where traditional data sources remain limited.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: Though dementia is a serious illness that progresses over many years, little is known about the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Objective: To test the impact of a virtual, nurse-led primary palliative care intervention on older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Methods: This randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed to compare the impact of {usual care} to {usual care plus a virtual, nurse-led, primary palliative care intervention} on community- dwelling, chronically ill older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Results: We hypothesize that patients in the virtual nurse intervention arm will have their primary palliative care needs identified and fulfilled compared to those in the usual care arm. Conclusions: Identification of the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of and/or with MCI, mild or moderate dementia will help refine intervention to effectively provide primary palliative care in a timely manner to these patients.

**Abstract:**
Introduction. HIV testing and treatment coverage among men in Zambia remains suboptimal, partly due to lower healthcare-seeking behavior compared to women. To address this gap, Circle of Hope (CoH), a local faith-based organization funded by the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), developed the community post (CP) model. CPs are staffed by multi-disciplinary teams that provide HIV-testing, anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) testing. This analysis assesses the impact of these CPs on HIV case finding, ART initiation, and VL suppression among men. Methods. Routine program data reported to PEPFAR by CoH Zambia were analyzed for two periods: pre-COVID 19 (April 2018-March 2020) and during the pandemic (April 2020-March 2022). Indicators included the number of HIV tests conducted and positive results received (overall and for index testing specifically), ART initiation among men living with HIV (MLHIV), 12-month retention on ART, and the proportion of clients with VL suppression (<1000 copies/mL). Results. Between April 2018 and March 2022, the number of CPs expanded from 9 to 38 across Zambia. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, men continued to represent a substantial share of clients: 49.5% to 41.4% of those tested, 38.5% to 42.0% of those diagnosed (p<0.001), and 38.9% to 43.3% of those initiated on ART (p<0.001). The number of men on ART rose from 3,320 (38%) to 13,580 (43%, p<0.000001). Retention and VL suppression among men also remained high, increasing slightly from 94% to 97% and 95% to 96%, respectively. Over 6,000 men were diagnosed through index testing services, with percent positivity consistently high, ranging from 54.4% to 61.1% (p<0.001). Conclusions. The CoH model was successful at identifying and linking MLHIV to HIV treatment services and assisting them to achieve and maintain viral suppression even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding this community-based model may help close HIV testing and treatment gaps among men and advance HIV epidemic control in Zambia and beyond.

**Abstract:**
Background There is a need for person-centred outcome measures (PCOMs) in tuberculosis (TB) clinical trials to capture the priorities of affected individuals relating to both disease and treatment, alongside the traditional efficacy and safety analysis. Methods We conducted a literature search to identify existing health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) measurement tools and instances where they have been used to evaluate TB disease in interventional studies. DR-TB survivors were recruited for focus group discussions in South Africa, Mongolia and Georgia to determine the most important aspects of disease and treatment experience from their perspective. A second round of focus groups then worked to prioritise these items and group them within different domains. A panel of researchers and academic clinicians evaluated existing PCOMs identified in the literature search using a published framework. Finally, an assessment was carried out by a experienced TB Community Advisory Group members for appropriateness and acceptability, and clinical trial site investigators for feasibility of the PCOMs. Results The initial round of 9 focus groups involving 57 participants identified priority items grouped under the fields overall quality of life, disease symptoms, and treatment and side effects. In the second round of four focus groups involving 26 participants, the highest ranked items under overall quality of life were duration of treatment, experience of swallowing pills, and how long before being able to contribute to the household. The most important symptoms were coughing, weight loss and breathlessness. The highest ranked side effects were nausea/vomiting, skin colour changes, and nerve problems. FACIT-TB was the only measurement tool assessed that was rated good for appropriateness, and excellent, good or fair in all other fields by community representatives, researchers and clinical trial site staff. Conclusions The FACIT-TB measurement tool was identified as the most appropriate disease-specific PCOM currently available for use in clinical trials investigating novel DR-TB therapeutics.

**Abstract:**
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) 2024 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment guidelines expand eligibility for nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment in individuals with chronic HBV infection. For countries to implement these guidelines, there is a critical need to understand the population who are treatment eligible. While HBV drug resistance (HBVDR) is uncommon, monitoring for any potential resistance is a relevant public health consideration. Methods: We studied a population in rural Uganda to describe the proportion of individuals eligible for treatment based on the 2024 WHO treatment guidelines. We determined how this proportion varies according to the eligibility criteria used, comparing the performance of different assessment tools. We calculated Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet Ratio Index; APRI, Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase-to-Platelet Ratio; GPR and transient elastography; TE and performed HBV sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology to determine the prevalence of HBVDR in treatment naive and treatment experienced individuals. Results: In this cohort, 24/63 (38%) individuals with CHB were eligible for treatment. This fell to 14/63 (22%) in a hypothetical scenario where TE was not available for the assessment of liver fibrosis. We demonstrate a lack of concordance between non-invasive tests (NIT) of liver disease in treatment-naive HBV mono-infected individuals. An APRI cut-off of 0.5 had a sensitivity of 23.0% for predicting a TE score of >7 kPa (F2 fibrosis). Sensitivity for detecting F2 fibrosis was increased to 38.5% using an APRI cut off of 0.36, and to 46.2% using the GPR. We did not identify any HBVDR in the HBV mono-infected treatment-naive population (n=58). 24/210 individuals were living with HIV/HBV coinfection; HBV was sequenced in 5 of these of whom 2 had genomic evidence of nucleos(t)ide analogue resistance (rt180M/204V). Conclusions: While the WHO 2024 treatment criteria offer an opportunity to expand access to care, there is a need to determine how assessment tools differ in determination of eligibility in different settings. HBVDR remains uncommon but more research is needed to understand its prevalence and clinical impact in African populations.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
Infectious diseases, also known as communicable disease or transmissible disease is illness that is caused due to pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. One of such infection is caused by zoonotic virus (bat-borne) known as Nipah virus (NiV). NiV is one of the worlds deadliest viruses leading to highest mortality rates. It is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to category C priority pathogen that belongs to genus Hepanivirus, and family Paramyxoviridae. The first occurrence of NiV was observed in Malaysia-Singapore during 1998-1999 and the most recent outbreak in Kozhikode district of Kerala in 2018.

Currently, no drugs or vaccines specific to NiV have proven to yield effective outcome at advanced stage of the disease. However, some therapies involving antiviral drug like Ribavirin along with other medicines have shown to recover patients, reducing the death rate by 36%. Due to extensive research various therapeutic strategies have been proven to successfully target the viral infection during the early stages in animal models. Several vaccines have been under investigation and clinical trials serving as a promising approach towards effective and safe vaccine in both livestock animals and humans.

This study underscores the essential contributions shaping the academic discourse in nipah virus research, bringing to light the most influential studies within the co-citation and co-occurrence network analysis. By identifying the keywords, we gain valuable insights into the foundational research driving advancements in this research area. The detailed mapping of the co-citation network further illuminates the interconnectedness of various research themes and the collaborative efforts that boost the field of nipah virus research in different horizons. The recognition of influential studies not only highlights the depth and breadth of scholarly engagement but also provides a roadmap for future research endeavours.

**Abstract:**
The growing interconnection between human, animal, and environmental health has escalated the need for integrated approaches to public health. The One Health framework addresses this necessity by promoting local, national, and global interdisciplinary collaboration. Population growth, intensive animal farming, and manmade environmental changes contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases of probable animal origin, such as COVID-19. Establishing the Quadripartite collaboration with four multilateral United Nations agencies underscores the increasing recognition of these interdependencies. This scoping review protocol aims to evaluate how One Health studies integrate human, animal, and environmental health, analyzing methodologies, scope, and interdisciplinary collaboration, to identify key achievements, existing gaps, and future research priorities. The projected literature search will include PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Virtual Health Library, Health Systems Evidence, and Social Systems Evidence. Additionally, grey literature will be retrieved from Opengrey, Thesis Commons, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations, by structured electronic search, as well as the first 100 entries in Google Scholar, manually. This protocol proposes to include studies, policies, regulations, strategies, and interventions published from 2004 onwards aimed at the prevention and integrated management of food safety, zoonotic diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and the impacts of climate change on health. No language filters will be applied. Two independent reviewers will analyze titles, abstracts, and full texts to conduct a two-phase review, with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. Data will be retrieved using a standardized data extraction form, and results will be presented in graphic and tabular format, accompanied by a narrative summary, to highlight the achievements of integrated One Health implementation. The expected result is the development of a scoping review protocol to map One Health studies and practices, which effectively integrate the human, animal, and environmental health dimensions applicable globally in public health scenarios.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

**Abstract:**
Despite intensive study, gaps remain in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to limited contextual metadata accompanying most large genomic surveillance datasets. We analyzed over 130,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, over 85,000 with matched epidemiological data, collected in Massachusetts from November 2021 to January 2023, to investigate viral transmission dynamics at high resolution. The data were drawn from diagnostic testing at >600 facilities representing schools, workplaces, public testing, and other sectors, and encompass the emergence of six major viral lineages, each representing a new outbreak. We found urban areas as key hubs for new lineage introduction and interurban transmission as facilitating spread throughout the state. Young adults, especially those on college campuses, served as early indicators of emerging lineage dominance. Resident-aged populations in college campuses and nursing homes exhibited a higher likelihood of being linked to within-facility transmission, while staff-aged at those facilities were more linked to their surrounding community. Individuals with recent vaccine doses, including boosters, had a lower likelihood of initiating transmission. This dataset shows the value of linking genomic and epidemiologic data at scale for higher resolution insights into viral dynamics and their implication for public health strategy.

**Abstract:**
IntroductionPneumonia is a leading cause of under-five mortality, with 30 million annual cases in India. Despite national guidelines, significant barriers to timely and appropriate care-seeking persist. Caregivers often face financial constraints, lack of awareness, mistrust in government facilities, and a preference for non-registered medical practitioners (non-RMP), delaying effective treatment. This study explores care-seeking behaviors, associated sociodemographic factors, and barriers to access to appropriate healthcare for childhood pneumonia in rural India.

MethodsThis study is part of a broader implementation research (IR) initiative and represents its formative phase. This mixed-methods study was conducted in Palwal district, Haryana, covering 42 villages (population: 107,440). A cross-sectional survey identified suspected pneumonia cases among 9,593 under-five children through house-to-house visits using a structured checklist. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, health insurance, care-seeking patterns, and provider preferences were collected. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) identified potential confounders in the association between care-seeking behaviour and key exposure variables. Additionally, qualitative in-depth interviews explored caregivers perceptions, decision-making, and healthcare barriers to pneumonia management. Quantitative data were analysed using logistic regression, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed using the Three Delays Model. Suspected under-five pneumonia cases caregivers and families were actively engaged in this formative phase to inform Phase II implementation strategies of broader IR, ensuring community-driven and contextually relevant strategies.

ResultsAmong 231 suspected pneumonia cases, 97% of caregivers sought medical care, but 71% consulted non-RMPs, and only 3.6% visited government facilities. Seeking appropriate care was associated with higher maternal education (AOR 6.5, 95% CI: 2.7, 9.7) and higher wealth index (AOR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.6). Thematic analysis revealed delays due to symptom misinterpretation, reliance on home remedies, financial constraints, gender biases, mistrust in public healthcare services, and logistical barriers.

ConclusionDespite high care-seeking rates, provider preferences, socio-cultural factors, and systemic barriers delay appropriate pneumonia treatment. Addressing these challenges requires improving awareness, enhancing public healthcare trust, and strengthening frontline health worker engagement. This study underscores the role of structured beneficiary involvement in refining pneumonia management strategies to ensure sustainable, community-driven interventions.

**Abstract:**
Psychedelics have garnered great attention in recent years as treatments for major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression due to their ability to alter consciousness and afflicted cognitive processes with lasting effects. Given these unique characteristics and the urgent need for efficacious treatments, psychedelics are being tested for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite promising results and growing interest, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics remain uncharacterized. Using a scoping review approach, we summarize current clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov that utilize classic psychedelics as interventions for SUDs with the goal of understanding the current state and outlook of the field. A second scoping review was conducted using PubMed and SCOPUS databases to identify the relevant publications addressing the pharmacotherapeutic potential of restoring dopamine homeostasis as a novel neurobiological mechanism of psychedelics. This mechanism may blunt drug-seeking behavior, promote drug abstinence, and underlie their clinical relevance for SUD in addition to previously characterized mechanisms.

**Abstract:**
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes significant morbidity, mortality, and growthth faltering among children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. While gut inflammation contributes to growth faltering, the role of ETEC in inflammation remains poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that ETEC-producing heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxins (ST) induced significant inflammation in humans, but LT-only strains are understudied. In this study, we evaluated the intestinal inflammation induced by the LT-only ETEC strain LSN03-016011/A in a human challenge model. Stool samples were analyzed for pre- and post-challenge myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines, ETEC shedding, and ETEC-specific antibody responses. MPO, IL-1{beta}, and IL-8 levels significantly increased post-ETEC challenge, but there was no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Participants protected from severe diarrhea had higher levels of pre-challenge IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-{gamma} compared to those not protected. The MPO and specific cytokine levels were significantly correlated with the seroconversion status to LT and the colonization factor antigen CS17. This study provides evidence that LT-ETEC strain can induce significant intestinal inflammation even in the absence of symptoms, highlighting the need for a vaccine and a better understanding of the impact of ETEC-attributable inflammation on child health in endemic areas.

Author summaryEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of enteric infections, resulting in diarrhea, malnutrition, and other long-term health effects. However, how ETEC - particularly strains that produce only the heat-labile toxin (LT) - can contribute to gut inflammation is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the impact of an LT-ETEC infection on gut inflammation and its relations to ETEC-specific immune responses using samples from participants in a controlled human infection study. We found that LT-ETEC induces a significant level of gut inflammation marker myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1{beta}, when the patients had moderate to severe diarrhea and even when diarrheal symptoms were mild or absent. Gut inflammation level correlated with immune responses to ETEC. These findings suggest that LT-ETEC infection causes significant gut inflammation, which plays a role in immune responses. Our results highlight the need for preventive strategies to reduce the burden of ETEC-related illness, particularly in regions where these infections are common, to prevent broader adverse consequences for gut health and child development.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundThe World Health Organization recommends perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), generally using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to children at high risk of severe P. falciparum malaria. Currently, PMC is given up to age two in perennial transmission settings. However, no recommendation exists for perennial settings with seasonal variation in transmission intensity, recently categorized as  sub-perennial. Tailored chemoprevention strategies are needed to protect children during seasons and ages of highest malaria risk. The seasonal dimension must adequately cover seasonally increased risk periods, alongside interventions that address year-round, lower intensity transmission. We propose a hybrid malaria chemoprevention (HMC) strategy, integrating two delivery components: 1) existing PMC, and 2) additional monthly SP doses during the higher-risk rainy season, ensuring a one-month gap between any two doses.

MethodsUsing a validated individual-based malaria model combined with pharmacological models of drug action (OpenMalaria), we examined the potential public health impact of the proposed HMC (for children 03-24 months), and an age-expanded HMC (referred to as HMC+, for children 03-36 months), under different drug sensitivity, coverage, and prevalence (5-70%) assumptions.

ResultsHMC and HMC+ demonstrated a median (interquartile range) of 2.1 (1.6-2.6), 2.9 (2.2-3.6) times higher efficacy (relative fold increase in burden averted) compared to only PMC against clinical, and 2.0 (0.6-3.4), 3.3 (0.8-5.8) against severe cases, respectively, in children under age three. This led to a median protective efficacy of 31.8% (25.4-38.2%), 44.9% (36.9-52.9%) against clinical, and 16.1% (7.0-25.2%), 26.4% (14.4-38.4%) against severe cases by HMC and HMC+ respectively, across the prevalence, drug sensitivity, and coverage assumptions. We found positive net impact for children under age five years, outweighing a limited potential of delayed malaria across settings.

ConclusionSubstantially increased public health benefits might be achieved by adding seasonally-targeted chemoprevention to current PMC in sub-perennial malaria transmission settings. Effectiveness-implementation studies should generate empirical evidence of public health impact including on the disease burden averted, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the hybrid approach. Such studies should also explore determinants of implementation success including operational feasibility, and acceptability of proposed dosing strategies which will facilitate deployment decisions.

**Abstract:**
Similarities between mental symptoms in Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and those in Post-COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PCVS) have been observed. Based on a representative survey of the population aged 18 to 69 years in Germany (n = 4,628), the epidemiologies of both PCS and PCVS were studied. Mental symptoms of PCS (fatigue/exhaustion/weakness, reduced performance, concentration and memory problems, sleep disorders and depressed mood) were reported by 12.1% and mental symptoms of PCVS were reported by 12.6% of all respondents. Concerning PCS, mental symptoms were reported more often by females compared to males (13.5% versus 10.7%), whereas no gender differences were found for PCVS. With the increasing number of booster vaccinations, mental PCVS decreased from 20.8% with one vaccination to 8.9% with four or more vaccinations. Overall, non-mRNA vaccines did not lead significantly to more mental symptoms than mRNA vaccines (12.9% versus 12.5%) but did differ concerning mental symptom patterns: concentration and memory problems (8.2% versus 3.3%), impaired performance (5.7% versus 4.2%) and sleep disorders (6.6% versus 3.2%) were reported more frequently in non-mRNA vaccines. The reported rate of mental PCVS being 12.6% is clearly higher than the 0.5% recorded by official documentation systems (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI)), suggesting a major underreporting. The data indicate that mental symptoms occurring in both PCS and PCVS are common, making the differential diagnosis between PCS and PCVS, as well as between both PCS and PCVS and independent mental disorders such as depressive disorders, an important but challenging task.

**Abstract:**
Background We aimed to estimate the burden of antibiotic-nonsusceptible non-bacteremic pneumonia and sinusitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in US adults ([&ge;]18 years). Methods We estimated antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococcal sinusitis and non-bacteremic pneumonia incidence as products of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates, serotype distribution, and serotype-specific antimicrobial nonsusceptibility prevalences by antibiotic class and guideline-recommended agents from 2016-2019. We derived pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates from national healthcare utilization surveys and administrative datasets; pneumococcal-attributable attributable percents and serotype distributions from published data; and serotype-specific nonsusceptibility estimates from Active Bacterial Core surveillance data. We evaluated nonsusceptibility for all serotypes and those targeted by 15-, 20- and 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15/20/21). Results An estimated 16.4% (95% confidence interval 12.8-21.4%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 19.0% (14.8-24.9%) of sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes, translating to 243,521 (179,673-333,675) and 1,844,726 (1,070,763-2,904,089) outpatient visits for pneumonia and sinusitis, respectively, and 10,155 (7,542-13,803) pneumonia hospitalizations annually. An estimated 31.2% (26.6-36.3%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 10.5% (9.4-12.0%) of pneumococcal sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]1 outpatient first-line antibiotic agent. Cases attributable to serotypes targeted by PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21 that were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes accounted for 7.4% (4.7-11.1%), 8.5% (5.8-12.1%), and 12.6% (9.2-17.5%) of all non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia cases, and 8.4% (5.3-12.5%), 9.4% (6.2-13.4), and 14.4% (10.4-20.0%) of all pneumococcal sinusitis cases. Conclusions We demonstrated high proportions of antibiotic nonsusceptibility in non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis in US adults. PCVs and antibiotic stewardship may mitigate antibiotic nonsusceptibility in pneumococcal disease.

**Abstract:**
Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a promising non-invasive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), though significant variability exists in patient responses. This quadruple-blind, sham-controlled crossover randomized clinical trial investigated whether clinical improvement was influenced by the spatial selection of stimulation sites or early cardiac rhythm modulations. Seventy-five MDD patients (33 women) were randomized to either personalized stimulation sites, identified via the strongest negative functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the default mode network (DMN), or fixed stimulation at the F3 position of the 10-20 EEG system. Electrocardiograms throughout stimulation monitored heart rate and its variability, focusing on heartbeat deceleration (RR slope) and changes in the root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats (RMSSD). Findings demonstrated that a higher RR slope within the first 45 seconds of stimulation predicted greater clinical improvement at six weeks, while a lower RMSSD change during the first 270 seconds correlated with improvement at one week. However, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between personalized and fixed stimulation sites. This study identified a significant relationship between early heart rhythm modulations and the antidepressant effects of accelerated iTBS in MDD. Although the spatial determination of stimulation sites did not enhance clinical improvement, iTBS-induced changes in cardiac rhythm during early sessions may develop into valuable biomarkers for stratifying patients, enabling more personalized and effective treatment strategies in the future.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: University students frequently experience challenges that affect their sleep quality, including academic stress, lifestyle habits, and socio-demographic factors. Common sleep disturbances, such as delayed sleep onset and poor sleep efficiency, often result in daytime dysfunction and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm. Methods: This cross-sectional study appraised sleep quality among undergraduate students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 530 undergraduate students were purposively selected from three public universities. Participants were chosen through convenience sampling, with students who had contracted COVID-19 during the study excluded from the sample. Results: The mean age of the university students was 21.1 (2.0) years. Regarding PSQI components, the participants showed moderate sleep latency (55.7%) and habitual sleep efficiency (56.0%), with mild levels of sleep disturbances at night (68.1%), daytime dysfunction (51.1%), and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm (48.5%). The global PSQI scores were poor for 59.4% of participants, while 40.6% had good scores, with a mean of 6.5(2.9). Among the students, 44.9% reported fair subjective sleep quality, followed by good (24.7%), very good (18.1%), and poor (12.3%) sleep quality. Lifestyle factors such as class attendance, online media usage, BMI, physical exercise, tea/coffee consumption, and smoking were significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Sleep quality factors like daytime sleep duration, nighttime sleep latency, and sleeping pill usage were also significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Significant associations were found between sleep quality and factors such as age, household income, daily study hours, BMI, daytime sleep, and sleep latency (p<0.05). Conclusion: The study revealed that longer sleep latency, daytime sleep, and sleeping pill usage were related with poorer sleep quality. It also emphasized that sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm were significant predictors of sleep quality.

**Abstract:**
In 2024, the Americas region experienced the largest dengue outbreak on record and Brazil was among the worst affected countries, reporting 6.6 million cases and 6,200 deaths. We report the long-term entomological and epidemiological effectiveness of city-wide deployment of wMel-strain Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti in Niteroi, a city of half a million people in Rio de Janeiro state, where Wolbachia releases across 70% of the urban population in 2017-2019 were expanded to remaining populated areas in 2023. wMel was durably established at [&ge;]95% prevalence in Ae. aegypti populations throughout Niteroi four years post-release, and up to seven years in the earliest release sites. This city-wide Wolbachia coverage provided sustained population-level protection against dengue throughout the five years post-intervention, including during the 2024 epidemic surge, averting an estimated three-quarters of the dengue case burden that would otherwise have been expected in Niteroi in 2024.

**Abstract:**
Background: Patients with rare cancers face substantial challenges due to limited evidence-based treatment options, resulting from sparse clinical trials. Advances in large language models (LLMs) and recommendation algorithms offer new opportunities to utilize all clinical trial information to improve clinical decisions. Methods: We used LLM to systematically extract and standardize more than 100,000 cancer trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Each trial was annotated using a customized scoring system reflecting cancer-treatment interactions based on clinical outcomes and trial attributes. Using this structured data set, we implemented three state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend potentially effective treatments across different cancer types. Results: The LLM-driven data extraction process successfully generated a comprehensive and rigorously curated database from fragmented clinical trial information, covering 78 cancer types and 5,315 distinct interventions. Recommendation models demonstrated high predictive accuracy (cross-validated RMSE: {0.49--0.62}) and identified clinically meaningful new treatments for melanoma, independently validated by oncology experts. Conclusions: Our study establishes a proof of concept demonstrating that the combination of LLMs with sophisticated recommendation algorithms can systematically identify novel and clinically plausible cancer treatments. This integrated approach may accelerate the identification of effective therapies for rare cancers, ultimately improving patient outcomes by generating evidence-based treatment recommendations where traditional data sources remain limited.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: Though dementia is a serious illness that progresses over many years, little is known about the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Objective: To test the impact of a virtual, nurse-led primary palliative care intervention on older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Methods: This randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed to compare the impact of {usual care} to {usual care plus a virtual, nurse-led, primary palliative care intervention} on community- dwelling, chronically ill older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Results: We hypothesize that patients in the virtual nurse intervention arm will have their primary palliative care needs identified and fulfilled compared to those in the usual care arm. Conclusions: Identification of the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of and/or with MCI, mild or moderate dementia will help refine intervention to effectively provide primary palliative care in a timely manner to these patients.

**Abstract:**
Introduction. HIV testing and treatment coverage among men in Zambia remains suboptimal, partly due to lower healthcare-seeking behavior compared to women. To address this gap, Circle of Hope (CoH), a local faith-based organization funded by the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), developed the community post (CP) model. CPs are staffed by multi-disciplinary teams that provide HIV-testing, anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) testing. This analysis assesses the impact of these CPs on HIV case finding, ART initiation, and VL suppression among men. Methods. Routine program data reported to PEPFAR by CoH Zambia were analyzed for two periods: pre-COVID 19 (April 2018-March 2020) and during the pandemic (April 2020-March 2022). Indicators included the number of HIV tests conducted and positive results received (overall and for index testing specifically), ART initiation among men living with HIV (MLHIV), 12-month retention on ART, and the proportion of clients with VL suppression (<1000 copies/mL). Results. Between April 2018 and March 2022, the number of CPs expanded from 9 to 38 across Zambia. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, men continued to represent a substantial share of clients: 49.5% to 41.4% of those tested, 38.5% to 42.0% of those diagnosed (p<0.001), and 38.9% to 43.3% of those initiated on ART (p<0.001). The number of men on ART rose from 3,320 (38%) to 13,580 (43%, p<0.000001). Retention and VL suppression among men also remained high, increasing slightly from 94% to 97% and 95% to 96%, respectively. Over 6,000 men were diagnosed through index testing services, with percent positivity consistently high, ranging from 54.4% to 61.1% (p<0.001). Conclusions. The CoH model was successful at identifying and linking MLHIV to HIV treatment services and assisting them to achieve and maintain viral suppression even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding this community-based model may help close HIV testing and treatment gaps among men and advance HIV epidemic control in Zambia and beyond.

**Abstract:**
Background There is a need for person-centred outcome measures (PCOMs) in tuberculosis (TB) clinical trials to capture the priorities of affected individuals relating to both disease and treatment, alongside the traditional efficacy and safety analysis. Methods We conducted a literature search to identify existing health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) measurement tools and instances where they have been used to evaluate TB disease in interventional studies. DR-TB survivors were recruited for focus group discussions in South Africa, Mongolia and Georgia to determine the most important aspects of disease and treatment experience from their perspective. A second round of focus groups then worked to prioritise these items and group them within different domains. A panel of researchers and academic clinicians evaluated existing PCOMs identified in the literature search using a published framework. Finally, an assessment was carried out by a experienced TB Community Advisory Group members for appropriateness and acceptability, and clinical trial site investigators for feasibility of the PCOMs. Results The initial round of 9 focus groups involving 57 participants identified priority items grouped under the fields overall quality of life, disease symptoms, and treatment and side effects. In the second round of four focus groups involving 26 participants, the highest ranked items under overall quality of life were duration of treatment, experience of swallowing pills, and how long before being able to contribute to the household. The most important symptoms were coughing, weight loss and breathlessness. The highest ranked side effects were nausea/vomiting, skin colour changes, and nerve problems. FACIT-TB was the only measurement tool assessed that was rated good for appropriateness, and excellent, good or fair in all other fields by community representatives, researchers and clinical trial site staff. Conclusions The FACIT-TB measurement tool was identified as the most appropriate disease-specific PCOM currently available for use in clinical trials investigating novel DR-TB therapeutics.

**Abstract:**
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) 2024 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment guidelines expand eligibility for nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment in individuals with chronic HBV infection. For countries to implement these guidelines, there is a critical need to understand the population who are treatment eligible. While HBV drug resistance (HBVDR) is uncommon, monitoring for any potential resistance is a relevant public health consideration. Methods: We studied a population in rural Uganda to describe the proportion of individuals eligible for treatment based on the 2024 WHO treatment guidelines. We determined how this proportion varies according to the eligibility criteria used, comparing the performance of different assessment tools. We calculated Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet Ratio Index; APRI, Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase-to-Platelet Ratio; GPR and transient elastography; TE and performed HBV sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology to determine the prevalence of HBVDR in treatment naive and treatment experienced individuals. Results: In this cohort, 24/63 (38%) individuals with CHB were eligible for treatment. This fell to 14/63 (22%) in a hypothetical scenario where TE was not available for the assessment of liver fibrosis. We demonstrate a lack of concordance between non-invasive tests (NIT) of liver disease in treatment-naive HBV mono-infected individuals. An APRI cut-off of 0.5 had a sensitivity of 23.0% for predicting a TE score of >7 kPa (F2 fibrosis). Sensitivity for detecting F2 fibrosis was increased to 38.5% using an APRI cut off of 0.36, and to 46.2% using the GPR. We did not identify any HBVDR in the HBV mono-infected treatment-naive population (n=58). 24/210 individuals were living with HIV/HBV coinfection; HBV was sequenced in 5 of these of whom 2 had genomic evidence of nucleos(t)ide analogue resistance (rt180M/204V). Conclusions: While the WHO 2024 treatment criteria offer an opportunity to expand access to care, there is a need to determine how assessment tools differ in determination of eligibility in different settings. HBVDR remains uncommon but more research is needed to understand its prevalence and clinical impact in African populations.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

**Abstract:**
Despite intensive study, gaps remain in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to limited contextual metadata accompanying most large genomic surveillance datasets. We analyzed over 130,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, over 85,000 with matched epidemiological data, collected in Massachusetts from November 2021 to January 2023, to investigate viral transmission dynamics at high resolution. The data were drawn from diagnostic testing at >600 facilities representing schools, workplaces, public testing, and other sectors, and encompass the emergence of six major viral lineages, each representing a new outbreak. We found urban areas as key hubs for new lineage introduction and interurban transmission as facilitating spread throughout the state. Young adults, especially those on college campuses, served as early indicators of emerging lineage dominance. Resident-aged populations in college campuses and nursing homes exhibited a higher likelihood of being linked to within-facility transmission, while staff-aged at those facilities were more linked to their surrounding community. Individuals with recent vaccine doses, including boosters, had a lower likelihood of initiating transmission. This dataset shows the value of linking genomic and epidemiologic data at scale for higher resolution insights into viral dynamics and their implication for public health strategy.

**Abstract:**
IntroductionPneumonia is a leading cause of under-five mortality, with 30 million annual cases in India. Despite national guidelines, significant barriers to timely and appropriate care-seeking persist. Caregivers often face financial constraints, lack of awareness, mistrust in government facilities, and a preference for non-registered medical practitioners (non-RMP), delaying effective treatment. This study explores care-seeking behaviors, associated sociodemographic factors, and barriers to access to appropriate healthcare for childhood pneumonia in rural India.

MethodsThis study is part of a broader implementation research (IR) initiative and represents its formative phase. This mixed-methods study was conducted in Palwal district, Haryana, covering 42 villages (population: 107,440). A cross-sectional survey identified suspected pneumonia cases among 9,593 under-five children through house-to-house visits using a structured checklist. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, health insurance, care-seeking patterns, and provider preferences were collected. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) identified potential confounders in the association between care-seeking behaviour and key exposure variables. Additionally, qualitative in-depth interviews explored caregivers perceptions, decision-making, and healthcare barriers to pneumonia management. Quantitative data were analysed using logistic regression, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed using the Three Delays Model. Suspected under-five pneumonia cases caregivers and families were actively engaged in this formative phase to inform Phase II implementation strategies of broader IR, ensuring community-driven and contextually relevant strategies.

ResultsAmong 231 suspected pneumonia cases, 97% of caregivers sought medical care, but 71% consulted non-RMPs, and only 3.6% visited government facilities. Seeking appropriate care was associated with higher maternal education (AOR 6.5, 95% CI: 2.7, 9.7) and higher wealth index (AOR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.6). Thematic analysis revealed delays due to symptom misinterpretation, reliance on home remedies, financial constraints, gender biases, mistrust in public healthcare services, and logistical barriers.

ConclusionDespite high care-seeking rates, provider preferences, socio-cultural factors, and systemic barriers delay appropriate pneumonia treatment. Addressing these challenges requires improving awareness, enhancing public healthcare trust, and strengthening frontline health worker engagement. This study underscores the role of structured beneficiary involvement in refining pneumonia management strategies to ensure sustainable, community-driven interventions.

**Abstract:**
Psychedelics have garnered great attention in recent years as treatments for major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression due to their ability to alter consciousness and afflicted cognitive processes with lasting effects. Given these unique characteristics and the urgent need for efficacious treatments, psychedelics are being tested for a variety of psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders (SUDs). Despite promising results and growing interest, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics remain uncharacterized. Using a scoping review approach, we summarize current clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov that utilize classic psychedelics as interventions for SUDs with the goal of understanding the current state and outlook of the field. A second scoping review was conducted using PubMed and SCOPUS databases to identify the relevant publications addressing the pharmacotherapeutic potential of restoring dopamine homeostasis as a novel neurobiological mechanism of psychedelics. This mechanism may blunt drug-seeking behavior, promote drug abstinence, and underlie their clinical relevance for SUD in addition to previously characterized mechanisms.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundThe World Health Organization recommends perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), generally using sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to children at high risk of severe P. falciparum malaria. Currently, PMC is given up to age two in perennial transmission settings. However, no recommendation exists for perennial settings with seasonal variation in transmission intensity, recently categorized as  sub-perennial. Tailored chemoprevention strategies are needed to protect children during seasons and ages of highest malaria risk. The seasonal dimension must adequately cover seasonally increased risk periods, alongside interventions that address year-round, lower intensity transmission. We propose a hybrid malaria chemoprevention (HMC) strategy, integrating two delivery components: 1) existing PMC, and 2) additional monthly SP doses during the higher-risk rainy season, ensuring a one-month gap between any two doses.

MethodsUsing a validated individual-based malaria model combined with pharmacological models of drug action (OpenMalaria), we examined the potential public health impact of the proposed HMC (for children 03-24 months), and an age-expanded HMC (referred to as HMC+, for children 03-36 months), under different drug sensitivity, coverage, and prevalence (5-70%) assumptions.

ResultsHMC and HMC+ demonstrated a median (interquartile range) of 2.1 (1.6-2.6), 2.9 (2.2-3.6) times higher efficacy (relative fold increase in burden averted) compared to only PMC against clinical, and 2.0 (0.6-3.4), 3.3 (0.8-5.8) against severe cases, respectively, in children under age three. This led to a median protective efficacy of 31.8% (25.4-38.2%), 44.9% (36.9-52.9%) against clinical, and 16.1% (7.0-25.2%), 26.4% (14.4-38.4%) against severe cases by HMC and HMC+ respectively, across the prevalence, drug sensitivity, and coverage assumptions. We found positive net impact for children under age five years, outweighing a limited potential of delayed malaria across settings.

ConclusionSubstantially increased public health benefits might be achieved by adding seasonally-targeted chemoprevention to current PMC in sub-perennial malaria transmission settings. Effectiveness-implementation studies should generate empirical evidence of public health impact including on the disease burden averted, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the hybrid approach. Such studies should also explore determinants of implementation success including operational feasibility, and acceptability of proposed dosing strategies which will facilitate deployment decisions.

**Abstract:**
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes significant morbidity, mortality, and growthth faltering among children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. While gut inflammation contributes to growth faltering, the role of ETEC in inflammation remains poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that ETEC-producing heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxins (ST) induced significant inflammation in humans, but LT-only strains are understudied. In this study, we evaluated the intestinal inflammation induced by the LT-only ETEC strain LSN03-016011/A in a human challenge model. Stool samples were analyzed for pre- and post-challenge myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines, ETEC shedding, and ETEC-specific antibody responses. MPO, IL-1{beta}, and IL-8 levels significantly increased post-ETEC challenge, but there was no significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Participants protected from severe diarrhea had higher levels of pre-challenge IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-{gamma} compared to those not protected. The MPO and specific cytokine levels were significantly correlated with the seroconversion status to LT and the colonization factor antigen CS17. This study provides evidence that LT-ETEC strain can induce significant intestinal inflammation even in the absence of symptoms, highlighting the need for a vaccine and a better understanding of the impact of ETEC-attributable inflammation on child health in endemic areas.

Author summaryEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the leading causes of enteric infections, resulting in diarrhea, malnutrition, and other long-term health effects. However, how ETEC - particularly strains that produce only the heat-labile toxin (LT) - can contribute to gut inflammation is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the impact of an LT-ETEC infection on gut inflammation and its relations to ETEC-specific immune responses using samples from participants in a controlled human infection study. We found that LT-ETEC induces a significant level of gut inflammation marker myeloperoxidase (MPO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1{beta}, when the patients had moderate to severe diarrhea and even when diarrheal symptoms were mild or absent. Gut inflammation level correlated with immune responses to ETEC. These findings suggest that LT-ETEC infection causes significant gut inflammation, which plays a role in immune responses. Our results highlight the need for preventive strategies to reduce the burden of ETEC-related illness, particularly in regions where these infections are common, to prevent broader adverse consequences for gut health and child development.

**Abstract:**
Similarities between mental symptoms in Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and those in Post-COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PCVS) have been observed. Based on a representative survey of the population aged 18 to 69 years in Germany (n = 4,628), the epidemiologies of both PCS and PCVS were studied. Mental symptoms of PCS (fatigue/exhaustion/weakness, reduced performance, concentration and memory problems, sleep disorders and depressed mood) were reported by 12.1% and mental symptoms of PCVS were reported by 12.6% of all respondents. Concerning PCS, mental symptoms were reported more often by females compared to males (13.5% versus 10.7%), whereas no gender differences were found for PCVS. With the increasing number of booster vaccinations, mental PCVS decreased from 20.8% with one vaccination to 8.9% with four or more vaccinations. Overall, non-mRNA vaccines did not lead significantly to more mental symptoms than mRNA vaccines (12.9% versus 12.5%) but did differ concerning mental symptom patterns: concentration and memory problems (8.2% versus 3.3%), impaired performance (5.7% versus 4.2%) and sleep disorders (6.6% versus 3.2%) were reported more frequently in non-mRNA vaccines. The reported rate of mental PCVS being 12.6% is clearly higher than the 0.5% recorded by official documentation systems (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI)), suggesting a major underreporting. The data indicate that mental symptoms occurring in both PCS and PCVS are common, making the differential diagnosis between PCS and PCVS, as well as between both PCS and PCVS and independent mental disorders such as depressive disorders, an important but challenging task.

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Infectious diseases, also known as communicable disease or transmissible disease is illness that is caused due to pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. One of such infection is caused by zoonotic virus (bat-borne) known as Nipah virus (NiV). NiV is one of the worlds deadliest viruses leading to highest mortality rates. It is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to category C priority pathogen that belongs to genus Hepanivirus, and family Paramyxoviridae. The first occurrence of NiV was observed in Malaysia-Singapore during 1998-1999 and the most recent outbreak in Kozhikode district of Kerala in 2018.

Currently, no drugs or vaccines specific to NiV have proven to yield effective outcome at advanced stage of the disease. However, some therapies involving antiviral drug like Ribavirin along with other medicines have shown to recover patients, reducing the death rate by 36%. Due to extensive research various therapeutic strategies have been proven to successfully target the viral infection during the early stages in animal models. Several vaccines have been under investigation and clinical trials serving as a promising approach towards effective and safe vaccine in both livestock animals and humans.

This study underscores the essential contributions shaping the academic discourse in nipah virus research, bringing to light the most influential studies within the co-citation and co-occurrence network analysis. By identifying the keywords, we gain valuable insights into the foundational research driving advancements in this research area. The detailed mapping of the co-citation network further illuminates the interconnectedness of various research themes and the collaborative efforts that boost the field of nipah virus research in different horizons. The recognition of influential studies not only highlights the depth and breadth of scholarly engagement but also provides a roadmap for future research endeavours.

**Abstract:**
Background We aimed to estimate the burden of antibiotic-nonsusceptible non-bacteremic pneumonia and sinusitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in US adults ([&ge;]18 years). Methods We estimated antibiotic-nonsusceptible pneumococcal sinusitis and non-bacteremic pneumonia incidence as products of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates, serotype distribution, and serotype-specific antimicrobial nonsusceptibility prevalences by antibiotic class and guideline-recommended agents from 2016-2019. We derived pneumonia and sinusitis incidence rates from national healthcare utilization surveys and administrative datasets; pneumococcal-attributable attributable percents and serotype distributions from published data; and serotype-specific nonsusceptibility estimates from Active Bacterial Core surveillance data. We evaluated nonsusceptibility for all serotypes and those targeted by 15-, 20- and 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15/20/21). Results An estimated 16.4% (95% confidence interval 12.8-21.4%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 19.0% (14.8-24.9%) of sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes, translating to 243,521 (179,673-333,675) and 1,844,726 (1,070,763-2,904,089) outpatient visits for pneumonia and sinusitis, respectively, and 10,155 (7,542-13,803) pneumonia hospitalizations annually. An estimated 31.2% (26.6-36.3%) of non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and 10.5% (9.4-12.0%) of pneumococcal sinusitis cases were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]1 outpatient first-line antibiotic agent. Cases attributable to serotypes targeted by PCV15, PCV20, and PCV21 that were nonsusceptible to [&ge;]3 antibiotic classes accounted for 7.4% (4.7-11.1%), 8.5% (5.8-12.1%), and 12.6% (9.2-17.5%) of all non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia cases, and 8.4% (5.3-12.5%), 9.4% (6.2-13.4), and 14.4% (10.4-20.0%) of all pneumococcal sinusitis cases. Conclusions We demonstrated high proportions of antibiotic nonsusceptibility in non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and sinusitis in US adults. PCVs and antibiotic stewardship may mitigate antibiotic nonsusceptibility in pneumococcal disease.

**Abstract:**
Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a promising non-invasive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), though significant variability exists in patient responses. This quadruple-blind, sham-controlled crossover randomized clinical trial investigated whether clinical improvement was influenced by the spatial selection of stimulation sites or early cardiac rhythm modulations. Seventy-five MDD patients (33 women) were randomized to either personalized stimulation sites, identified via the strongest negative functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the default mode network (DMN), or fixed stimulation at the F3 position of the 10-20 EEG system. Electrocardiograms throughout stimulation monitored heart rate and its variability, focusing on heartbeat deceleration (RR slope) and changes in the root mean square of successive differences between heartbeats (RMSSD). Findings demonstrated that a higher RR slope within the first 45 seconds of stimulation predicted greater clinical improvement at six weeks, while a lower RMSSD change during the first 270 seconds correlated with improvement at one week. However, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between personalized and fixed stimulation sites. This study identified a significant relationship between early heart rhythm modulations and the antidepressant effects of accelerated iTBS in MDD. Although the spatial determination of stimulation sites did not enhance clinical improvement, iTBS-induced changes in cardiac rhythm during early sessions may develop into valuable biomarkers for stratifying patients, enabling more personalized and effective treatment strategies in the future.

**Abstract:**
In 2024, the Americas region experienced the largest dengue outbreak on record and Brazil was among the worst affected countries, reporting 6.6 million cases and 6,200 deaths. We report the long-term entomological and epidemiological effectiveness of city-wide deployment of wMel-strain Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti in Niteroi, a city of half a million people in Rio de Janeiro state, where Wolbachia releases across 70% of the urban population in 2017-2019 were expanded to remaining populated areas in 2023. wMel was durably established at [&ge;]95% prevalence in Ae. aegypti populations throughout Niteroi four years post-release, and up to seven years in the earliest release sites. This city-wide Wolbachia coverage provided sustained population-level protection against dengue throughout the five years post-intervention, including during the 2024 epidemic surge, averting an estimated three-quarters of the dengue case burden that would otherwise have been expected in Niteroi in 2024.

**Abstract:**
Background: Patients with rare cancers face substantial challenges due to limited evidence-based treatment options, resulting from sparse clinical trials. Advances in large language models (LLMs) and recommendation algorithms offer new opportunities to utilize all clinical trial information to improve clinical decisions. Methods: We used LLM to systematically extract and standardize more than 100,000 cancer trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Each trial was annotated using a customized scoring system reflecting cancer-treatment interactions based on clinical outcomes and trial attributes. Using this structured data set, we implemented three state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend potentially effective treatments across different cancer types. Results: The LLM-driven data extraction process successfully generated a comprehensive and rigorously curated database from fragmented clinical trial information, covering 78 cancer types and 5,315 distinct interventions. Recommendation models demonstrated high predictive accuracy (cross-validated RMSE: {0.49--0.62}) and identified clinically meaningful new treatments for melanoma, independently validated by oncology experts. Conclusions: Our study establishes a proof of concept demonstrating that the combination of LLMs with sophisticated recommendation algorithms can systematically identify novel and clinically plausible cancer treatments. This integrated approach may accelerate the identification of effective therapies for rare cancers, ultimately improving patient outcomes by generating evidence-based treatment recommendations where traditional data sources remain limited.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: Though dementia is a serious illness that progresses over many years, little is known about the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Objective: To test the impact of a virtual, nurse-led primary palliative care intervention on older adults at risk of already diagnosed with cognitive impairment. Methods: This randomized clinical trial (RCT) was designed to compare the impact of {usual care} to {usual care plus a virtual, nurse-led, primary palliative care intervention} on community- dwelling, chronically ill older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Results: We hypothesize that patients in the virtual nurse intervention arm will have their primary palliative care needs identified and fulfilled compared to those in the usual care arm. Conclusions: Identification of the primary palliative care needs of chronically-ill, community dwelling older adults at risk of and/or with MCI, mild or moderate dementia will help refine intervention to effectively provide primary palliative care in a timely manner to these patients.

**Abstract:**
Introduction. HIV testing and treatment coverage among men in Zambia remains suboptimal, partly due to lower healthcare-seeking behavior compared to women. To address this gap, Circle of Hope (CoH), a local faith-based organization funded by the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), developed the community post (CP) model. CPs are staffed by multi-disciplinary teams that provide HIV-testing, anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and viral load (VL) testing. This analysis assesses the impact of these CPs on HIV case finding, ART initiation, and VL suppression among men. Methods. Routine program data reported to PEPFAR by CoH Zambia were analyzed for two periods: pre-COVID 19 (April 2018-March 2020) and during the pandemic (April 2020-March 2022). Indicators included the number of HIV tests conducted and positive results received (overall and for index testing specifically), ART initiation among men living with HIV (MLHIV), 12-month retention on ART, and the proportion of clients with VL suppression (<1000 copies/mL). Results. Between April 2018 and March 2022, the number of CPs expanded from 9 to 38 across Zambia. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, men continued to represent a substantial share of clients: 49.5% to 41.4% of those tested, 38.5% to 42.0% of those diagnosed (p<0.001), and 38.9% to 43.3% of those initiated on ART (p<0.001). The number of men on ART rose from 3,320 (38%) to 13,580 (43%, p<0.000001). Retention and VL suppression among men also remained high, increasing slightly from 94% to 97% and 95% to 96%, respectively. Over 6,000 men were diagnosed through index testing services, with percent positivity consistently high, ranging from 54.4% to 61.1% (p<0.001). Conclusions. The CoH model was successful at identifying and linking MLHIV to HIV treatment services and assisting them to achieve and maintain viral suppression even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding this community-based model may help close HIV testing and treatment gaps among men and advance HIV epidemic control in Zambia and beyond.

**Abstract:**
Background There is a need for person-centred outcome measures (PCOMs) in tuberculosis (TB) clinical trials to capture the priorities of affected individuals relating to both disease and treatment, alongside the traditional efficacy and safety analysis. Methods We conducted a literature search to identify existing health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL) measurement tools and instances where they have been used to evaluate TB disease in interventional studies. DR-TB survivors were recruited for focus group discussions in South Africa, Mongolia and Georgia to determine the most important aspects of disease and treatment experience from their perspective. A second round of focus groups then worked to prioritise these items and group them within different domains. A panel of researchers and academic clinicians evaluated existing PCOMs identified in the literature search using a published framework. Finally, an assessment was carried out by a experienced TB Community Advisory Group members for appropriateness and acceptability, and clinical trial site investigators for feasibility of the PCOMs. Results The initial round of 9 focus groups involving 57 participants identified priority items grouped under the fields overall quality of life, disease symptoms, and treatment and side effects. In the second round of four focus groups involving 26 participants, the highest ranked items under overall quality of life were duration of treatment, experience of swallowing pills, and how long before being able to contribute to the household. The most important symptoms were coughing, weight loss and breathlessness. The highest ranked side effects were nausea/vomiting, skin colour changes, and nerve problems. FACIT-TB was the only measurement tool assessed that was rated good for appropriateness, and excellent, good or fair in all other fields by community representatives, researchers and clinical trial site staff. Conclusions The FACIT-TB measurement tool was identified as the most appropriate disease-specific PCOM currently available for use in clinical trials investigating novel DR-TB therapeutics.

**Abstract:**
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) 2024 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment guidelines expand eligibility for nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment in individuals with chronic HBV infection. For countries to implement these guidelines, there is a critical need to understand the population who are treatment eligible. While HBV drug resistance (HBVDR) is uncommon, monitoring for any potential resistance is a relevant public health consideration. Methods: We studied a population in rural Uganda to describe the proportion of individuals eligible for treatment based on the 2024 WHO treatment guidelines. We determined how this proportion varies according to the eligibility criteria used, comparing the performance of different assessment tools. We calculated Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet Ratio Index; APRI, Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase-to-Platelet Ratio; GPR and transient elastography; TE and performed HBV sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology to determine the prevalence of HBVDR in treatment naive and treatment experienced individuals. Results: In this cohort, 24/63 (38%) individuals with CHB were eligible for treatment. This fell to 14/63 (22%) in a hypothetical scenario where TE was not available for the assessment of liver fibrosis. We demonstrate a lack of concordance between non-invasive tests (NIT) of liver disease in treatment-naive HBV mono-infected individuals. An APRI cut-off of 0.5 had a sensitivity of 23.0% for predicting a TE score of >7 kPa (F2 fibrosis). Sensitivity for detecting F2 fibrosis was increased to 38.5% using an APRI cut off of 0.36, and to 46.2% using the GPR. We did not identify any HBVDR in the HBV mono-infected treatment-naive population (n=58). 24/210 individuals were living with HIV/HBV coinfection; HBV was sequenced in 5 of these of whom 2 had genomic evidence of nucleos(t)ide analogue resistance (rt180M/204V). Conclusions: While the WHO 2024 treatment criteria offer an opportunity to expand access to care, there is a need to determine how assessment tools differ in determination of eligibility in different settings. HBVDR remains uncommon but more research is needed to understand its prevalence and clinical impact in African populations.

**Abstract:**
While widely used to study vaccine effectiveness, test negative designs (TND) also provide a platform for identifying and quantifying immunological correlates of protection against disease. A key component of such studies is the protection function, the mathematical relationship between the value of an immunological assay and the relative risk of disease. This function is often estimated using logistic regression, comparing the odds of disease at a given assay value to the odds at assay value zero. Here, we show through mathematical analysis and simulation experiments that logistic regression, while common, fundamentally constrains the functional forms of protection that can be inferred from data in TNDs, potentially leading to overly simplistic estimates of the protection function. To address this limitation, we adapt and analyze a scaled logit model, originally developed for case-control data, as a flexible alternative that allows for greater flexibility in estimating protection functions from TND data. We demonstrate that this approach improves accuracy across a range of biologically plausible protection functions, highlight conditions under which it may fail, and provide practical guidance for researchers to adopt it as a new standard for TND studies evaluating correlates of protection.

**Abstract:**
The growing interconnection between human, animal, and environmental health has escalated the need for integrated approaches to public health. The One Health framework addresses this necessity by promoting local, national, and global interdisciplinary collaboration. Population growth, intensive animal farming, and manmade environmental changes contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases of probable animal origin, such as COVID-19. Establishing the Quadripartite collaboration with four multilateral United Nations agencies underscores the increasing recognition of these interdependencies. This scoping review protocol aims to evaluate how One Health studies integrate human, animal, and environmental health, analyzing methodologies, scope, and interdisciplinary collaboration, to identify key achievements, existing gaps, and future research priorities. The projected literature search will include PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Virtual Health Library, Health Systems Evidence, and Social Systems Evidence. Additionally, grey literature will be retrieved from Opengrey, Thesis Commons, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations, by structured electronic search, as well as the first 100 entries in Google Scholar, manually. This protocol proposes to include studies, policies, regulations, strategies, and interventions published from 2004 onwards aimed at the prevention and integrated management of food safety, zoonotic diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and the impacts of climate change on health. No language filters will be applied. Two independent reviewers will analyze titles, abstracts, and full texts to conduct a two-phase review, with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. Data will be retrieved using a standardized data extraction form, and results will be presented in graphic and tabular format, accompanied by a narrative summary, to highlight the achievements of integrated One Health implementation. The expected result is the development of a scoping review protocol to map One Health studies and practices, which effectively integrate the human, animal, and environmental health dimensions applicable globally in public health scenarios.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background: University students frequently experience challenges that affect their sleep quality, including academic stress, lifestyle habits, and socio-demographic factors. Common sleep disturbances, such as delayed sleep onset and poor sleep efficiency, often result in daytime dysfunction and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm. Methods: This cross-sectional study appraised sleep quality among undergraduate students in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 530 undergraduate students were purposively selected from three public universities. Participants were chosen through convenience sampling, with students who had contracted COVID-19 during the study excluded from the sample. Results: The mean age of the university students was 21.1 (2.0) years. Regarding PSQI components, the participants showed moderate sleep latency (55.7%) and habitual sleep efficiency (56.0%), with mild levels of sleep disturbances at night (68.1%), daytime dysfunction (51.1%), and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm (48.5%). The global PSQI scores were poor for 59.4% of participants, while 40.6% had good scores, with a mean of 6.5(2.9). Among the students, 44.9% reported fair subjective sleep quality, followed by good (24.7%), very good (18.1%), and poor (12.3%) sleep quality. Lifestyle factors such as class attendance, online media usage, BMI, physical exercise, tea/coffee consumption, and smoking were significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Sleep quality factors like daytime sleep duration, nighttime sleep latency, and sleeping pill usage were also significantly associated with sleep quality (p<0.05). Significant associations were found between sleep quality and factors such as age, household income, daily study hours, BMI, daytime sleep, and sleep latency (p<0.05). Conclusion: The study revealed that longer sleep latency, daytime sleep, and sleeping pill usage were related with poorer sleep quality. It also emphasized that sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction, and difficulty maintaining enthusiasm were significant predictors of sleep quality.

**Abstract:**
Social isolation is a growing public health concern, particularly among cancer survivors who face persistent challenges in maintaining social connections following treatment. While its impact on mental health is increasingly recognized, the underlying pathways and contextual differences across rural and urban settings remain underexplored. This study aimed to identify the psychosocial and personal factors that contribute to perceived social isolation among U.S. cancer survivors and to assess how isolation mediates the relationship between these factors and mental health. We also examined whether these associations differ between rural and urban populations. Data were drawn from the 2022 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 6), with a subsample of cancer survivors (n = 926). A conceptual framework was developed using constructs from the Biopsychosocial Model, the Stress Process Model, the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, and the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to evaluate the relationships among personal factors (age, BMI, time since diagnosis, inability of self-care), psychosocial perceptions (perceived care quality, cancer information comprehension, negative life perception), social isolation, and mental health (PHQ-4). Multigroup analysis compared rural and urban survivors. Social isolation was a strong predictor of mental health, with key antecedents including cancer information access, inability of self-care, time since diagnosis, negative life perception, and perception of care quality. Several pathways varied by geography; for instance, the effects of self-care difficulty and care perception on isolation and mental health were significant only in urban settings. This study highlights the central role of social isolation in shaping mental health outcomes among cancer survivors and underscores the importance of targeted, context-sensitive interventions to reduce isolation and promote psychosocial well-being, particularly in underserved rural communities.

**Abstract:**
Background: Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumors frequently diagnosed in pediatric and young adult patients. These tumors respond poorly to conventional immunotherapy, though the precise reason for this is not known. We sought to characterize the systemic immune response to sarcomas by measuring the levels of circulating cytokines in the plasma of sarcoma patients, testing the hypothesis that the natures of a patient's immune response to their tumor directly affects outcome. Methods: Plasma was collected from newly diagnosed, treatment-naive pediatric sarcoma patients participating in an ongoing clinical trial, MCC20320. A panel of 18 cytokines was selected and cytokine levels were measured using the Luminex platform. Cytokine levels were analyzed based on clinicopathological parameters such as gender, age, stage, and survival. Results: We found that the cytokine profile in patients newly diagnosed with sarcoma is distinct from healthy controls, but different sarcomas were not distinguishable. Patients with osteosarcoma who had elevated levels of multiple cytokines had inferior overall survival compared to those with fewer or no elevated levels. Similarly, elevated levels of individual cytokines and chemokines, including IL-24, CXCL5, and CXCL10, were associated with inferior event-free or overall survival in patients with osteosarcoma. Perhaps most significantly, elevated IL-1B; at diagnosis was associated with metastatic presentation and inferior event-free survival in patients with osteosarcoma. Conclusion: These findings suggest that pediatric sarcoma patients mount a systemic immune response that may affect event-free or overall survival. IL-1B; in particular may be a valuable target for immunotherapy for osteosarcoma patients.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
The methylation profile of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of great interest as a liquid biopsy for the detection and monitoring of cancer and other pathologies. Here we introduce 'circulating cell-free DNA reduced representation bisulfite sequencing' (cf-RRBS), enabling the use of highly effective RRBS on highly fragmented plasma cfDNA as well as on FFPE-archived cancer tissues. The method enriches the CpG-rich RRBS target regions by enzymatic degradation of all off-target DNA rather than by targeted capture, in contrast to previous methods. Critical steps are fully enzymatic in a single-tube, making it rapid, cost-effective, robust and easily implemented on a liquid-handling station for high-throughput sample preparation. We benchmark cf-RRBS results to those obtained by previous more complex methods and exemplify its use for accurate non-invasive subtyping of lung cancer, a frequent onco-pathology task. cf-RRBS enables any molecular pathology lab to tap into the cfDNA methylome, only making use of off-the-shelf reagents and open-source data analysis tools.

## Crosstalk between Proline Hydroxylation and Histidine Methylation Regulates Actin-Dependent Cell Mobility Control

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
The methylation profile of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of great interest as a liquid biopsy for the detection and monitoring of cancer and other pathologies. Here we introduce 'circulating cell-free DNA reduced representation bisulfite sequencing' (cf-RRBS), enabling the use of highly effective RRBS on highly fragmented plasma cfDNA as well as on FFPE-archived cancer tissues. The method enriches the CpG-rich RRBS target regions by enzymatic degradation of all off-target DNA rather than by targeted capture, in contrast to previous methods. Critical steps are fully enzymatic in a single-tube, making it rapid, cost-effective, robust and easily implemented on a liquid-handling station for high-throughput sample preparation. We benchmark cf-RRBS results to those obtained by previous more complex methods and exemplify its use for accurate non-invasive subtyping of lung cancer, a frequent onco-pathology task. cf-RRBS enables any molecular pathology lab to tap into the cfDNA methylome, only making use of off-the-shelf reagents and open-source data analysis tools.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
The methylation profile of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of great interest as a liquid biopsy for the detection and monitoring of cancer and other pathologies. Here we introduce 'circulating cell-free DNA reduced representation bisulfite sequencing' (cf-RRBS), enabling the use of highly effective RRBS on highly fragmented plasma cfDNA as well as on FFPE-archived cancer tissues. The method enriches the CpG-rich RRBS target regions by enzymatic degradation of all off-target DNA rather than by targeted capture, in contrast to previous methods. Critical steps are fully enzymatic in a single-tube, making it rapid, cost-effective, robust and easily implemented on a liquid-handling station for high-throughput sample preparation. We benchmark cf-RRBS results to those obtained by previous more complex methods and exemplify its use for accurate non-invasive subtyping of lung cancer, a frequent onco-pathology task. cf-RRBS enables any molecular pathology lab to tap into the cfDNA methylome, only making use of off-the-shelf reagents and open-source data analysis tools.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

## Crosstalk between Proline Hydroxylation and Histidine Methylation Regulates Actin-Dependent Cell Mobility Control

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
The methylation profile of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of great interest as a liquid biopsy for the detection and monitoring of cancer and other pathologies. Here we introduce 'circulating cell-free DNA reduced representation bisulfite sequencing' (cf-RRBS), enabling the use of highly effective RRBS on highly fragmented plasma cfDNA as well as on FFPE-archived cancer tissues. The method enriches the CpG-rich RRBS target regions by enzymatic degradation of all off-target DNA rather than by targeted capture, in contrast to previous methods. Critical steps are fully enzymatic in a single-tube, making it rapid, cost-effective, robust and easily implemented on a liquid-handling station for high-throughput sample preparation. We benchmark cf-RRBS results to those obtained by previous more complex methods and exemplify its use for accurate non-invasive subtyping of lung cancer, a frequent onco-pathology task. cf-RRBS enables any molecular pathology lab to tap into the cfDNA methylome, only making use of off-the-shelf reagents and open-source data analysis tools.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

## Crosstalk between Proline Hydroxylation and Histidine Methylation Regulates Actin-Dependent Cell Mobility Control

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

## Solving General QUBOs with Warm-Start QAOA via a Reduction to Max-Cut

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
The methylation profile of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of great interest as a liquid biopsy for the detection and monitoring of cancer and other pathologies. Here we introduce 'circulating cell-free DNA reduced representation bisulfite sequencing' (cf-RRBS), enabling the use of highly effective RRBS on highly fragmented plasma cfDNA as well as on FFPE-archived cancer tissues. The method enriches the CpG-rich RRBS target regions by enzymatic degradation of all off-target DNA rather than by targeted capture, in contrast to previous methods. Critical steps are fully enzymatic in a single-tube, making it rapid, cost-effective, robust and easily implemented on a liquid-handling station for high-throughput sample preparation. We benchmark cf-RRBS results to those obtained by previous more complex methods and exemplify its use for accurate non-invasive subtyping of lung cancer, a frequent onco-pathology task. cf-RRBS enables any molecular pathology lab to tap into the cfDNA methylome, only making use of off-the-shelf reagents and open-source data analysis tools.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
The methylation profile of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of great interest as a liquid biopsy for the detection and monitoring of cancer and other pathologies. Here we introduce 'circulating cell-free DNA reduced representation bisulfite sequencing' (cf-RRBS), enabling the use of highly effective RRBS on highly fragmented plasma cfDNA as well as on FFPE-archived cancer tissues. The method enriches the CpG-rich RRBS target regions by enzymatic degradation of all off-target DNA rather than by targeted capture, in contrast to previous methods. Critical steps are fully enzymatic in a single-tube, making it rapid, cost-effective, robust and easily implemented on a liquid-handling station for high-throughput sample preparation. We benchmark cf-RRBS results to those obtained by previous more complex methods and exemplify its use for accurate non-invasive subtyping of lung cancer, a frequent onco-pathology task. cf-RRBS enables any molecular pathology lab to tap into the cfDNA methylome, only making use of off-the-shelf reagents and open-source data analysis tools.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

## Crosstalk between Proline Hydroxylation and Histidine Methylation Regulates Actin-Dependent Cell Mobility Control

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Matched Keywords:** pandemic

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility. Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
The methylation profile of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of great interest as a liquid biopsy for the detection and monitoring of cancer and other pathologies. Here we introduce 'circulating cell-free DNA reduced representation bisulfite sequencing' (cf-RRBS), enabling the use of highly effective RRBS on highly fragmented plasma cfDNA as well as on FFPE-archived cancer tissues. The method enriches the CpG-rich RRBS target regions by enzymatic degradation of all off-target DNA rather than by targeted capture, in contrast to previous methods. Critical steps are fully enzymatic in a single-tube, making it rapid, cost-effective, robust and easily implemented on a liquid-handling station for high-throughput sample preparation. We benchmark cf-RRBS results to those obtained by previous more complex methods and exemplify its use for accurate non-invasive subtyping of lung cancer, a frequent onco-pathology task. cf-RRBS enables any molecular pathology lab to tap into the cfDNA methylome, only making use of off-the-shelf reagents and open-source data analysis tools.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.

**Abstract:**
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm
that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization,
especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various
ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using
classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically
cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths.
For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state
using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of
the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite
warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard
reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We
empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes
the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging
from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such
as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio
optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly
dependent on the problem type.

**Abstract:**
The methylation profile of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of great interest as a liquid biopsy for the detection and monitoring of cancer and other pathologies. Here we introduce 'circulating cell-free DNA reduced representation bisulfite sequencing' (cf-RRBS), enabling the use of highly effective RRBS on highly fragmented plasma cfDNA as well as on FFPE-archived cancer tissues. The method enriches the CpG-rich RRBS target regions by enzymatic degradation of all off-target DNA rather than by targeted capture, in contrast to previous methods. Critical steps are fully enzymatic in a single-tube, making it rapid, cost-effective, robust and easily implemented on a liquid-handling station for high-throughput sample preparation. We benchmark cf-RRBS results to those obtained by previous more complex methods and exemplify its use for accurate non-invasive subtyping of lung cancer, a frequent onco-pathology task. cf-RRBS enables any molecular pathology lab to tap into the cfDNA methylome, only making use of off-the-shelf reagents and open-source data analysis tools.

**Abstract:**
Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified the key components involved in ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. The plant-specific, Roh-like (ROPs) small GTPases are negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, which can shut off "leaky" ABA signal transduction caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for negative regulation of ABA signaling by ROP GTPases remain elusive. In this study, we have utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 milliseconds) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and standard protein-protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. In addition, we have elucidated the detailed complex association pathway and identified the critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 for complex stability. Overall, this study has established a powerful framework of using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the negative regulation of ABA signal transduction by small GTPases.

**Abstract:**
Actin filaments generate intrinsic forces that are essential for cell motility. This process is tightly regulated by various posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, arginylation, and oxidation. However, the role of actin hydroxylation in regulating its dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain-containing proteins (PHDs) activity significantly promotes actin polymerization and enhances cell motility.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundColchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug, was used early in the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to modulate the inflammatory response. However, its clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients, particularly when used alongside corticosteroids, remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed colchicines efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in hospitalized adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} statistic.

ResultsThirteen RCTs involving 16,529 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine did not significantly reduce overall mortality (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.02, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): [-0.04, 0.00]), ICU admissions (RD = -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.06, 0.01]), mechanical ventilation rates (RD = -0.01, 95% CI: [-0.02, 0.00]), hospitalization duration (Mean Difference (MD) = -0.58 days, 95% CI: [-1.80, 0.64]), or ICU length of stay (MD = -1.41 days, 95% CI: [-3.35, 0.53]), although in every comparison colchicine treated groups had a greater positive effect. Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in mortality among patients who received colchicine in the absence of corticosteroids (RD = -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.11, -0.03]), whereas no significant effect was observed in patients treated with colchicine and corticosteroids.

ConclusionsWhile colchicine did not improve outcomes in the overall population, it showed benefits in COVID-19 patients not receiving corticosteroids. These findings suggest a potential role for colchicine in targeted clinical settings.

**Abstract:**
BackgroundCardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), including diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome, are rising sharply in South Asias urban populations. However, the influence of ethnic and regional variation within these urban settings remains poorly understood.

ObjectiveTo systematically review the literature on ethnic and regional disparities in cardiometabolic risk among urban South Asian adults, with emphasis on subnational variability in India, particularly Odisha and Kalahandi district.

MethodsThis review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature (WHO, ICMR) for studies published between 2015 and 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on urban South Asian adults ([&ge;]18 years) with data stratified by ethnicity or region. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and AMSTAR-2. A narrative synthesis was conducted.

ResultsThirteen studies were included. CMD prevalence varied by country, state, and district. Northern and western India showed higher CMD rates than eastern regions. In Odisha, metabolic syndrome prevalence ranged from 24% to 33.5%, with a pronounced gender gap in central obesity and pre-metabolic syndrome. Findings from Kalahandi district revealed a substantial burden of early-stage CMD risk, especially among young urban adults.

ConclusionCardiometabolic risk among urban South Asians is shaped by complex regional and ethnic factors. Public health strategies must move beyond generalized models to adopt localized, culturally tailored interventions that address the specific needs of diverse urban populations.

Using hydroxylation proteomics, we identified actin as a substrate for PHDs, with hydroxylation occurring at multiple proline residues, especially at proline 70 (Pro70). This modification recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which then leads to the disruption of the interaction between actin and the histidine methyltransferase SET Domain Containing 3 (SETD3). Consequently, SETD3-mediated methylation of histidine 73 (His73) on actin is suppressed, impairing actin polymerization and compromising cell motility. Notably, genetic loss of VHL or pharmacological inhibition of PHDs restores His73 methylation, enhances actin filament formation, and promotes cell motility. Together, our findings uncover a novel regulatory crosstalk between hydroxylation and methylation on actin, establishing a critical mechanism by which PTMs fine-tune actin dynamics to govern cell motility.

**Abstract:**
Amphioxus is considered the best-known living proxy to the chordate ancestor and an irreplaceable model organism for evolutionary studies of chordates and deuterostomes. In this study, a high-quality genome of the Beihai amphioxus, Branchiostoma belcheri beihai, was de novo assembled and annotated. Within four amphioxus genomes, twenty-eight groups of gene novelties were identified, revealing new genes that lack homologs in non-deuterostome metazoa, but share unexpectedly high similarities with those from non-metazoan species. These gene innovation events have played roles in amphioxus adaptations, including innate immunity responses, glycolysis, and regulation of calcium balance. The gene novelties related to innate immunity, such as a group of lipoxygenases and a DEAD-box helicase, boosted amphioxus immune responses. The novel genes for alcohol dehydrogenase and ferredoxin could aid in the glycolysis of amphioxus. A proximally arrayed cluster of EF-hand calcium-binding protein genes were identified to resemble those of bacteria. The copy number of this gene cluster was negatively correlated to the sea salinity of the collection region, suggesting that it may enhance their survival at different calcium concentrations. This comprehensive study collectively reveals insights into adaptive evolution of cephalochordates and provides valuable resources for research on early evolution of deuterostomes.

**Abstract:**
Background Stillbirths do not only trigger maternal psychological trauma but also affect socioeconomic growth in low- and middle-income countries. Given the diverse dynamics of the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirths in various low-resource settings, such as Ghana, it is essential to have comprehensive knowledge to address and mitigate these factors that could influence stillbirths. However, there is data paucity on maternal factors contributing to stillbirths in semi-rural areas of Ghana. Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated maternal factors of stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana. Design This is a cross-sectional study that utilised a quantitative approach. Methods The study was conducted among 422 mothers who delivered in public health facilities and reside in a semi-rural municipality in Northern Ghana. Sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical-related data were gathered through structured interviews and from record reviews. Chi-square test of proportions and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to identify the independent factors associated with stillbirths at a 95% confidence level. Results Stillbirth rate was estimated at 4.0% (95%CI: 2.4%, 6.4%). The analysis revealed that anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy (aOR:3.15; 95%CI:2.94, 10.6; p=0.034), positive sickle cell status (aOR:2.91; 95%CI:1.50, 7.01; p=0.018), and non-utilisation of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) (aOR:7.75; 95%CI:2.33,9.8; p=0.001) during pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirths. Conclusion The relatively high prevalence of stillbirths in the municipality was influenced by medical factors (particularly anaemia and positive sickle cell status) and unsafe health practices via the non-use of ITNs during pregnancy. The management of the Ghana Health Service, alongside program planners and other stakeholders involved in enhancing perinatal and maternal health, should focus on implementing effective initiatives such as improved health education on nutrition and safety practices at the facility and community levels, as well as robust referral systems to prevent and reduce stillbirths in semi-rural Ghana.

**Abstract:**
Background Preventing and treating post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as Long COVID, has become a public health priority. Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1

**Abstract:**
Background: We studied post-COVID-19 condition by investigating health-related quality of life and fatigue in the general Dutch population in the early phase of the pandemic, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections among unvaccinated individuals. Methods: (Still) unvaccinated participants aged [&ge;]15 years were selected from the February 2021 round of the nationwide seroepidemiological PIENTER Corona cohort study. We assessed associations between the time since serologically-identified SARS-CoV-2 infection and four outcome measures: health utility (Short-Form 6 Dimensions), mental health and physical health (Short Form Health Survey 12) and fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue). Per outcome, cutoff points were selected at each 5% increment (5-75%) along the cumulative distribution of those uninfected. At each cutoff, multivariable logistic regression models (score below cutoff yes/no) were fitted adjusted for infection history, age, sex, education level, comorbidities, and restriction intensity. Results: At the cutoff of the lowest 15th percentile among uninfected, significant differences between uninfected (n=4,569) and infected [&le;]4 months ago (n=351) were observed for health utility (OR [95%CI]: 1.6 [1.2-2.2]), physical health (1.9 [1.5-2.5]) and fatigue (1.6 [1.3-2.1]), but not for mental health (1.2 [0.9-1.6]). There were no significant differences between uninfected and infected >4 months ago (n=327) for all outcomes at any cutoff of the cumulative distribution, with post-hoc analysis showing a power to detect prevalence differences as low as 7%. Conclusions: In the first year of the pandemic, data from this Dutch population-based seroepidemiological cohort showed that unvaccinated individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection [&le;]4 months ago reported poorer health utility and physical health, and more severe fatigue compared to those uninfected. Interestingly, for those infected >4 months ago differences remained below the detection limit, suggesting a lower population prevalence of post-COVID-19 condition than currently found in literature for this period.
