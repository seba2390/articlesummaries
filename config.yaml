# --- Notifications Configuration ---
notifications:
  # --- Enable/Disable Email ---
  # Set this to 'true' to enable sending summary emails, 'false' to disable.
  # If false, the settings below are ignored.
  send_email_summary: true

  # --- Recipient Emails ---
  # A list of email addresses that will receive the summary email.
  # Add each recipient on a new line starting with '- '.
  email_recipients:
    - "some_email@gmail.com"
    # - "another_email@example.org"

  # --- Sender Email Credentials ---
  # IMPORTANT: Storing credentials directly in this file is INSECURE,
  # especially if you commit it to version control (like Git).
  # It's strongly recommended to use one of these alternatives:
  #   1. Environment Variables: Load the address/password from the system environment.
  #   2. Secrets Manager: Use a dedicated service (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.).
  #   3. App Passwords (Gmail/Google Workspace): If using Gmail with 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled,
  #      you MUST generate an "App Password" specifically for this application.
  #      See: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
  email_sender:
    # The email address the summary email will be sent FROM.
    address: ""

    # The email password for the sender address OR the generated App Password (e.g. if using Gmail with 2FA enabled).
    password: ""

  # --- SMTP Server Details ---
  # These settings tell the script how to connect to your email provider's sending server.
  # You often need to look these up for your specific email provider (e.g., search "Gmail SMTP settings").
  smtp:
    # The hostname of the SMTP server.
    # Common examples:
    #   - Gmail: "smtp.gmail.com"
    #   - Outlook/Office365: "smtp.office365.com"
    #   - Yahoo: "smtp.mail.yahoo.com"
    server: "smtp.gmail.com"

    # The port number for the SMTP server connection.
    # Common examples:
    #   - 587 (Recommended for TLS/STARTTLS encryption)
    #   - 465 (Used for older SSL encryption)
    #   - 25 (Standard SMTP, often blocked, usually unencrypted - avoid if possible)
    # Port 587 is the most common for modern secure connections.
    port: 587
